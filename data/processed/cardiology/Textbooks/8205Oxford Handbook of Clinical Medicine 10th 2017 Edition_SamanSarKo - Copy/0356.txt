atrial conduction causing a repetitive sensing/pacing loop. This can be fi xed by changing pacing programming parameters. Congenital arrhythmogenic cardiac conditions As well as the many acquired conditions that can predispose to arrhythmias (p125), there are a number of congenital conditions. These may be clinically silent until a fatal attack and are likely to be responsible for most cases of sudden adult death syndrome (SADS). They include: WPW syndrome (Wolff -Parkinson-White; fi g 3.37.) Caused by congenital acces- sory conduction pathway between atria and ventricles. Resting ECG shows short PR interval, wide QRS complex (due to slurred upstroke or ‘delta wave’) and ST-T changes. Two types: WPW type A (+ve  wave in V1), WPW type B (Ωve  wave in V1). Tachycardia can be due to an AVRT or pre-excited AF/atrial fl utter (p130). Manage- ment may include ablation of the accessory pathway. LQTS (Long QT syndromes.) These are channelopathies that result in prolonged repolarization phases, predisposing the patient to ventricular arrhythmias; classi- cally torsades de pointes. p804. Conditions associated with LQTS include Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome (p702) and Romano–Ward syndrome (p710). ARVC (Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.) RV myocardium is re- placed with fi bro-fatty material. Symptoms: palpitations and
