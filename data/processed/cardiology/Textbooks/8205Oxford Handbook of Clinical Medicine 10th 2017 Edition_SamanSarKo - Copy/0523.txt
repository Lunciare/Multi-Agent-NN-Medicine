(Ω15 vs Ω5mmol/L), weight (Ω11kg vs Ω7kg), and HDL. Diabetes drugs were reduced or eliminated in 95% of LCKD vs 62% of LGID participants.6 NB: eff ects on renal func- tion and mortality are unknown so these diets remain controversial. Monitoring glucose control 1 Fingerprick glucose if on insulin (type 1/2). NB: before a meal informs about long-acting insulin doses; after meals inform about the dose of short-acting insulin. 2 Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) relates to mean glucose level over previous 8wks (RBC t½). Targets are negotiable, eg 48–57mmol/mol (depends on pa- tient’s wish and arterial risk, eg past MI or stroke). If at risk from the eff ects of hypoglycaemia, eg elderly patients prone to falls, consider less tight control. Tight control may not alter all-cause mortality.7 Complications rise with rising HbA1c, so any improvement helps. 3 Be sure to ask about hypoglycaemic attacks (and whether symptomatic). Hypoglycaemic awareness may diminish if control is too tight, or with time in type 1 DM, due to glucagon secretion. It may return if control is loosened. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 220077 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE 208 Treating diabetes mellitus General Focus on education and lifestyle advice (eg exercise to insulin sensitiv- ity), healthy eating: p244—saturated fats,
