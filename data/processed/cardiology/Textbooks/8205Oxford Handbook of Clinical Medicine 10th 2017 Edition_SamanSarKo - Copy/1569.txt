Staging investigations should include CXR, bone scan, liver USS, CT/ MRI or PET-CT (p739), + LFTS and Ca2+. Radiotherapy (p526) to painful bony lesions (bis- phosphonates, p677, may  pain and fracture risk). Tamoxifen is often used in ER+ve; if relapse after initial success, consider chemotherapy. Trastuzumab should be given for HER2 +ve tumours, in combination with chemotherapy. CNS surgery for solitary (or easily accessible) metastases may be possible; if not—radiotherapy.
