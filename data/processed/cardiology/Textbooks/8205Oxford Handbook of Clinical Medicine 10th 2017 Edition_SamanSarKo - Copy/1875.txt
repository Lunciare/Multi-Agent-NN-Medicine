with acute abdominal symptoms: • Suspicion of obstruction (or intussusception, eg in paediatrics). • Acute fl are of infl ammatory bowel disease (eg to confi rm/exclude megacolon). • Renal colic with known renal stones (if fi rst presentation, CT KUB is better). • Ingestion of a sharp or poisonous foreign body (eg lithium battery). Bowel gas pattern is best assessed on supine images and free intraperitoneal gas (signifying perforation) is best seen on an erect CXR (fi g 13.26, p607). Gas patterns Look for: an abnormal quantity of gas in the stomach, small intestine, or colon. Decide whether you are looking at small or large bowel (fi g 16.8; table 16.3). Small bowel diameter is normally ~2.5cm, the colon ~5cm, the caecum up to 10cm. Di- lated small bowel is seen in obstruction and paralytic ileus. Dilated large bowel (6cm) is seen in both these, and also in ‘toxic dilatation’, and, in the elderly, in benign hypoto- nicity. Grossly dilated segments of bowel (coff ee bean sign) are seen in sigmoid and caecal volvulae—fi g 13.28c, p611. Loss of normal mucosal folds and bowel wall thicken- ing are seen in infl ammatory colitis (eg IBD)—fi g 16.9. ‘Thumb-printing’ is protrusion
