positive for blood but microscopy of urine does not show RBCS (thus diff erentiating it from haematuria, but not myoglobinuria—where CK ± AST will be high). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 770055 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 semordnys suomynopE Marfan’s syndrome (table 15.3) Autosomal dominant disorder (fi brillin-1) with 706 extracellular microfi bril formation; but ~25% have no family history. Major crite- ria: (Diagnostic if >2): lens dislocation (ectopia lentis; fi g 15.9); aortic dissection/ dilata tion; dural ectasia; skeletal features: arachnodactyly (long spidery fi ngers), armspan > height, pectus deformity, scoliosis, pes planus. Minor signs: Mitral valve prolapse, high-arched palate, joint hypermobility. Diagnosis is clinical; MRI for dural ectasia. : The danger is aortic dissection: -blockers slow dilatation of the aortic root. Annual echos, surgical repair when aortic diameter is >5cm. In pregnancy risk of dissection. Homocystinuria has similar skeletal deformities.
