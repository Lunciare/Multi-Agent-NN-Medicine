Middle- aged men are more frequently and severely aff ected than women, in whom the dis- ease tends to present ~10yrs later (menstrual blood loss is protective). Genetics HH is one of the commonest inherited conditions in those of Northern Euro- pean (especially Celtic) ancestry (carrier rate of ~1 in 10 and a frequency of homozy- gosity of ~1 in 200–400). The gene responsible for most HH is HFE: the 2 commonest mutations are termed C282Y and H63D. C282Y
