or gurgle on drinking? Yes: Suspect a pharyngeal pouch (see OHCS p570). Signs Is the patient cachectic or anaemic? Examine the mouth; feel for supraclavic- ular nodes (left supraclavicular node = Virchow’s node—suggests intra-abdominal ma- lignancy); look for signs of systemic disease, eg systemic sclerosis (p552), CNS disease. Tests FBC (anaemia); U&E (dehydration). Upper GI endoscopy ± biopsy (fi g 6.13). If suspi- cion of pharyngeal pouch consider contrast swallow (± ENT opinion). Video fl uoroscopy may help identify neurogenic causes. Oesophageal manometry for dysmotility. Specifi c conditions Oesophagitis: See p254. Diffuse oesophageal spasm: Causes in- termittent dysphagia ± chest pain. Contrast swallow/manometry: abnormal contrac- tions.5 Achalasia: Coordinated peristalsis is lost and the lower oesophageal sphincter fails to relax (due to degeneration of the myenteric plexus), causing dysphagia, re- gurgitation, and weight. Characteristic fi ndings on manometry or contrast swallow showing dilated tapering oesophagus. Treatment: endoscopic balloon dilatation, or Heller’s cardiomyotomy—then proton pump inhibitors (PPIS, p254). Botulinum toxin in- jection if a non-invasive procedure is needed (repeat every few months). Calcium chan- nel blockers and nitrates may also relax the sphincter. Benign oesophageal stricture: Caused by gastro-oesophageal refl ux (GORD, p254), corrosives, surgery, or radiotherapy. Treatment: endoscopic balloon dilatation. Oesophageal
