radiotherapy. 30% transform to acute leukaemia. Tests: Pancytopenia (p364), with reticulocyte count. Marrow cellularity is usu- ally increased due to ineff ective haematopoiesis. Ring sideroblasts may also be seen in the marrow (fi g 8.9, p327). Treatment: • Multiple transfusions of red cells or platelets as needed. • Erythropoietin ± G-CSF (p352) may lower transfusion requirement. • Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is one option (curative but often inappro- priate owing to age-related comorbidities—most are >70yrs old). • Low-intensity treatments that are not curative but may improve quality of life in symptomatic disease include thalidomide analogues (eg lenalidomide) or hy- pomethylating agents (eg azacitidine and decitabine). Heterogeneity in AML Consider four types of heterogeneity as we move through medical history: mor- phologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, and molecular. Genomic technologies enable an ever more detailed molecular analysis of AML and this can be used to in- form prognosis and guide risk stratifi cation. Epigenetic and other profi ling reveals more and more biomarkers, eg mutations in the genes encoding DNA (cytosine-5)- methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 335577 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 358 Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) CML is characterized by an uncontrolled clonal proliferation of myeloid cells (fi g 8.54).
