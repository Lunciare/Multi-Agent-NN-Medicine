may oc- cur in fl at, normal-looking mucosa. To spot precursor areas of dysplasia, surveillance colonoscopy eg 1–5yrs (depending on risk), with multiple random biopsies or biopsies guided by diff erential uptake by abnormal mucosa of dye sprayed endoscopically. Treatment Goals are to induce, then maintain disease remission.7 Mild UC: • 5-ASA,17 eg mesalazine (=mesalamine) is the mainstay for remission-induc- tion/maintenance. Given PR (suppositories or enemas) for distal disease (eg Pen- tasa® 1g daily); or PO for more extensive disease (eg Pentasa® 2g daily; once-daily dosing as eff ective as split dose; combine PR+PO if fl are). • Topical steroid foams PR (eg hydrocortisone as Colifoam®), or prednisolone 20mg retention enemas (Predsol®) less eff ective than PR 5-ASA but may be added in addition. Moderate UC: If 4–6 motions/day, but otherwise well, induce remission with oral prednisolone 40mg/d for 1wk, then taper by 5mg/week over following 7wks. Then maintain on 5-ASA (SES: rash, haemolysis, hepa titis, pancreatitis, paradoxical wors- ening of colitis monitor FBC and U&E at start, then at 3 months, then annually). 17 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA or mesalazine) must be stabilized in oral preparations to survive gastric pH. Alternatively, olsalazine is a dimer of 5-ASA or balsalazide is
