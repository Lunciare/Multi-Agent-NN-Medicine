airway ob- struction (FEV1 <80% predicted; FEV1/FVC <0.7; see p162 and table 4.5) with little or no reversibility. It includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Usually patients have either COPD or asthma, not both: COPD is favoured by: •age of onset >35yrs •smok- ing (passive or active) or pollution related38 •chronic dyspnoea •sputum production •minimal diurnal or day-to-day FEV1 variati on. Chronic bronchitis is defi ned clini- cally as cough, sputum production on most days for 3 months of 2 successive yrs. Symptoms improve if they stop smoking. There is no excess mortality if lung func- tion is normal. Emphysema is defi ned histologically as enlarged air spaces distal to terminal bronchioles, with destruction of alveolar walls but often visualized on CT. Prevalence 10–20% of the over-40s; 2.5≈106 deaths/yr worldwide. 39 Pink puff ers and blue bloaters A traditional division but likely ends of a spec- trum. Pink puffers: Have alveolar ventilation, a near normal PaO2 and a normal or low PaCO2. They are breathless but are not cyanosed. They may progress to type I respiratory failure (p188). Blue bloaters: Have alveolar ventilation, with a low PaO2 and a high PaCO2. They are cyanosed but not breathless and may go on
