c (10%); see fi g 3.51. Blood tests: FBC, ESR, U&E, cardiac enzymes (NB: troponin may be raised); tests relating to possible aeti- ologies. Cardiomegaly on CXR may indicate a pericardial eff usion. Echo (if suspected pericardial eff usion). CMR and CT may show localized infl ammation. Treatment: NSAIDs or aspirin with gastric protection for 1–2weeks. Add colchicine 500mcg OD or BD for 3 months to reduce the risk of recurrence. Rest until symptoms resolve. Treat the cause. If not improving or autoimmune, consider steroids (may increase the risk of recurrence) or other immunosuppressive therapies. Pericardial eff usion Accumulation of fl uid in the pericardial sac (normally 10– 50mL).68 Causes: Pericarditis, myocardial rupture (haemopericardium—surgical, stab wound, post-MI); aortic dissection; pericardium fi lling with pus; malignancy. Clinical features: Dyspnoea, chest pain, signs of local structures being compressed— hiccoughs (phrenic N), nausea (diaphragm), bronchial breathing at left base (Ewart’s sign: compressed left lower lobe). Muffl ed heart sounds. Look for signs of cardiac tamponade (below). Diagnosis: CXR shows an enlarged, globular heart if eff usion >300mL; fi g 3.14. ECG shows low-voltage QRS complexes and may have alternating QRS morphologies (elec- trical alternans). Echocardi ography shows an echo-free zone surrounding the heart.
