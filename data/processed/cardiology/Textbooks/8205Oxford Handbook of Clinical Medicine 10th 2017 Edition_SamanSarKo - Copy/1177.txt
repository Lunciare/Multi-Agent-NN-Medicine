that supply the brain with blood: the internal carotids (anteriorly) and the basilar artery (posteriorly, formed by the joining of the vertebral arteries, which supply the brainstem). This arrangement may compensate for the eff ects of occlusion of a feeder vessel by allowing supply from unaff ected vessels; however, the anatomy of the circle of Willis is variable and in many people it does not provide much protection. Cerebral arteries Three pairs of arteries leave the circle of Willis to supply the cerebral hemispheres: the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries (fi gs 10.2, 10.3). The anterior and middle cerebrals are branches of the internal carotid arteries; in 80%, the basilar artery divides into the two posterior cerebral arteries. Ischaemia from occlusion of any one of them may be lessened by retrograde supply from lep- tomeningeal vessels. Anterior cerebral artery: (fi g 10.2) Supplies the frontal and medial part of the cerebrum. Occlusion may cause a weak, numb contralateral leg ± similar, if milder, arm symptoms. The face is spared. Bilateral infarction is a rare cause of paraplegia and an even rarer cause of akinetic mutism. Middle cerebral artery: (fi g 10.2) Supplies the lateral part of each hemisphere. Oc-
