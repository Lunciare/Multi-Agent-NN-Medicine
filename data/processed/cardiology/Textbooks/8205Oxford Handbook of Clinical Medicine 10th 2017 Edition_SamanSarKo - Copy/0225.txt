aneurysm until proven otherwise. 3 Auscultation: The presence of bruits suggests arterial disease. Listen over the major arteries—carotids, abdominal aorta, renal arteries, iliac femorals. 4 Special tests: Buerger’s angle is that above the horizontal plane which leads to development of pallor (<20° indicates severe ischaemia). Buerger’s sign is the sequential change in colour from white to pink, upon return to the dependent position; if the limbs become fl ushed red (reactive hyperaemia) this is indicative of more severe disease. 5 Complete your examination: measure ABPI (p656), US Doppler assessment, and a neurological examination of the lower limbs. Venous (See also p658.) 1 Inspection: Look for any varicosities and decide whether they are the long sa- phenous vein (medial), short saphenous vein (posterior lateral, below the knee), or from the calf perforators (usually few varicosities but commonly show skin changes). Ulcers around the medial malleolus are more suggestive of venous disease, whereas those at the pressure points suggest arterial pathology. Brown haemosiderin deposits result from venous hypertension. There may also be atro- phy and loss of skin elasticity (lipodermatosclerosis) in venous disease. 2 Palpation: Warm varicose veins may indicate infection. Are they tender? Firm, tender varicosities suggests thrombosis. Palpate the saphenofemoral
