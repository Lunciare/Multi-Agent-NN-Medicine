severe pain, triggered by cold, dehydration, infection, or hypoxia. Hands and feet are aff ected if <3yrs old leading to dactylitis. Occlusion may cause mesenteric ischaemia, mimicking an acute abdomen. CNS infarction occurs in ~10% of children, leading to stroke, seizures, or cognitive defects. Transc ranial Doppler ultrasonography indicates risk of impending stroke, and blood transfusions can prevent this by reducing HbS. Also avascular necrosis (eg of femoral head), leg ulcers (fi g 8.38) and low-fl ow priapism (also seen in CML, may respond to hydration, -agonists, eg phenylephrine, or aspiration of blood + irrigation with saline; if for >12h prompt cavernosus–spongiosum shunting can prevent later impotence). Aplastic crisis: This is due to parvovirus B19, with sudden reduction in marrow production, especially RBCs. Usually self-limiting <2wks; transfusion may be needed. Sequestration crisis: Mainly aff ects children as in adults the spleen becomes atrophic. There is pooling of blood in the spleen ± liver, with organomegaly, severe anaemia, and shock. Urgent transfusion is needed. Complications • Splenic infarction occurs before 2yrs old, due to micro- vascular occlusion, leading to susceptibility to infection (40% of childhood sickle deaths are caused this way). • Poor growth. • Chronic renal failure. • Gall- stones.
