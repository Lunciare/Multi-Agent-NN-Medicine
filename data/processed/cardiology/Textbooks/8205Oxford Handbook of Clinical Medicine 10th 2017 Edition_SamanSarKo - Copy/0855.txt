may erythropoietin (SE: fl u-like symptoms, hypertension, mild rise in the platelet count and thromboembolism). Also eff ective in improving quality of life in malignant disease. IV iron can safely overcome the functional iron defi ciency. Hepcidin inhibitors and infl ammatory modulators show promise. Sideroblastic anaemia Microcytic anaemia does not always mean iron defi ciency! 20% of older people with an MCV <75fL are not iron defi cient. Think of sideroblastic anaemia whenever microcytic anaemia is not responding to iron. This condition is characterized by ineff ective erythropoiesis, leading to iron absorption, iron loading in marrow ± hae- mosiderosis (endocrine, liver, and heart damage due to iron deposition). Causes Congenital (rare, x-linked) or acquir ed, eg idiopathic as one of the myelo- dysplastic/myeloprolife rative diseases, can also follow chemotherapy, anti-TB drugs, irradiation, alcohol or lead excess. Tests Look for ferritin, a hypo chromic blood fi lm, and disease-defi ning sideroblasts in the marrow (fi gs 8.8, 8.9; table 8.1). Treatment Remove the cause. Pyridoxine ± repeated transfusions for severe anaemia. 2 In one study, 11% presenting to their GP with IDA had GI carcinoma. Plan both upper and lower GI investiga- tion: there may be abnormalities on both. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 332266
