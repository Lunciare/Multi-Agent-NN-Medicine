and there is severe refl ux (confi rmed by pH- monitoring)—see p254. Symptoms may be complicated by a hiatus hernia, which is repaired during the procedure. Surgery The defect in the diaphragm is repaired by tightening the crura. Refl ux is prevented by wrapping the gastric fundus around the lower oesophageal sphinc- ter—see fi g 13.39. There are various types of procedure, eg Nissen (360° wrap), Toupet (270° posterior wrap), Watson (anterior hemifundoplication). Laparoscopic surgery is at least as eff ective at controlling refl ux as open surgery but with a lower mortality and morbidity. Wound infections and respiratory complications are also more common in open surgery, though the incidence of dysphagia is similar for the two procedures—but see p592. Complications Dysphagia (if the wrap is too tight), ‘gas-bloat syndrome’ (inability to belch/vomit), and new-onset diarrhoea.
