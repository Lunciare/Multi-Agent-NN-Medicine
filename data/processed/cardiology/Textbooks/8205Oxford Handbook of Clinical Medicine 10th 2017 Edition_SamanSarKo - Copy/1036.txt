meningism variable. May be associated skin (molluscum-like papules) and lung disease. Investigation: LP with manometry. CSF stain (India ink), CSF/blood cryptococcal antigen. Treatment: in- duction with liposomal amphotericin B (SE: renal tubular damage and AKI). Addition of fl ucytosine has shown benefi t in patients not on ART (SE: haematological toxic- ity). Maintenance treatment with fl uconazole. Normalize ICP with repeat LPs/shunt. • Toxoplasma gondii: Toxoplasma abscesses are commonest cause of intracranial mass lesions when CD4 <200 cells/microlitre. Presentation: focal neurological signs ± seizures. Headache and vomiting if raised ICP. Investigation: ring-enhancing le- sions on MRI ( lymphoma) with associated oedema. CSF PCR for T. gondii is spe- cifi c but only moderately sensitive. Blood serology is not diagnostic as most cases are a reactivation of previous infection. Treatment: consider in any brain mass lesion with CD4 <200 cell/microlitre. Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, folinic acid. • Cytomegalovirus (CMV): Severe primary or reactivated disease (see p405). Presen- tation: retinitis (blurred then loss of vision), encephalitis, GI disease (oesophagitis, colitis), hepatitis, bone marrow suppression, pneumonia. Diagnosis: serial CMV viral load, retinal lesions (p438), GI ulceration, ‘owl’s eye’ inclusions on biopsy. Treatment: ganciclovir/valganciclovir. Side-eff ects: rash, diarrhoea, bone myelosuppression. • Cryptosporidium: Common cause of chronic
