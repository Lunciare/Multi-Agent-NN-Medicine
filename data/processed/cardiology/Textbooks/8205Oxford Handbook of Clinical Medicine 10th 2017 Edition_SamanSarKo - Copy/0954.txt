ESR (p372). Urea and creatinine, Ca2+ (in ~40%). Alk phos usually  unless healing fracture. Bone marrow biopsy: See fi gs 8.70–8.73. Screening test: Serum and/or urine electrophoresis. 2-microglobulin (prognostic). Imaging: X-rays: lytic ‘punched-out’ lesions, eg pepper-pot skull, vertebral collapse, fractures, or osteopo- rosis. CT or MRI may be useful to detect lesions not seen on XR. Diagnostic criteria: See BOX ‘Myeloma diagnosis’. Treatment Supportive: • Analgesia for bone pain (avoid NSAIDS due to risk of renal impairment). Give all patients a bisphosphonate (clod ronate, zolendronate, or pa- midronate), as they reduce fracture rates and bone pain. Local radiotherapy can help rapidly in focal disease. Orthopaedic procedures (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) may be helpful in vertebral collapse. • Anaemia should be corrected with transfu- sion, and erythropoietin may be used. • Renal failure: rehydrate, and ensure adequate fl uid intake of 3L/day to prevent further light chain-induced renal impairment. Di- alysis may be needed in acute kidney injury. • Infections: Treat rapidly with broad- spectrum antibiotics until culture results are known. Regular IV immunoglobulin infusions may be needed if recurrent. Chemotherapy: Induction therapy with, eg lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexa- methasone. In suitably fi t patients this may be followed by autologous
