of surgery as this precludes a labile cardiovascular response. • Contraceptive pill: See BNF. Stop 4wks before major/leg surgery; ensure alterna- tive contraception is used. Restart 2wks after surgery, provided patient is mobile. • Digoxin: Continue up to and including morning of surgery. Check for toxicity (ECG; plasma level); do plasma K+ and Ca2+ (suxamethonium can K+ and lead to ventricu- lar arrhythmias in the fully digitalized). • Diuretics: Beware hypokalaemia, dehydration. Do U&E (and bicarbonate). • Eye-dr o ps: -blockers get systemically absorbed. • HRT: As with contraceptive pill there may be an increased risk of DVT/PE. • Levodopa: Possible arrhythmias when patient under GA. • Lithium: Get expert help; may potentiate neuromuscular blockade and cause ar- rhythmias. See OHCS p349. • MAOIS: Get expert help as interactions may cause hypotensive/hypertensive crises. • Thyroid medication: see p600. • Tricyclics: These enhance adrenaline (epinephrine) and arrhythmias. Preparation Starve patient; NBM ≥2h pre-op for clear fl uids and ≥6h for solids.1 • Is any bowel or skin preparation needed, or prophylactic antibiotics (p570)? • Start DVT prophylaxis as indicated, eg graduated compression stockings (CI in pe- ripheral arterial disease); LMWH (p350): eg moderate risk, 20mg ~2h pre-op then 20mg/24h; high risk
