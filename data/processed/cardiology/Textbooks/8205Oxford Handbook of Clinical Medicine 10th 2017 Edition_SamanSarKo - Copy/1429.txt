or colchicine (0.5mg/12h PO for up to 6 months). Avoid stopping allopurinol in acute attacks once established. Febuxostat (80mg/24h) is an alternative if allopuri- nol is CI or not tolerated. It  uric acid by inhibiting xanthine oxidase (SE: LFTS) and is more eff ective at reducing serum urate than allopurinol (number of acute attacks the same).35 Uricosuric drugs  urate excretion. Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) • Acute CPPD crystal arthritis Acute monoarthropathy usually of larger joints in elderly. Usually spontaneous but can be provoked by illness, surgery, or trauma. • Chronic CPPD Infl ammatory RA-like (symmetrical) polyarthritis and synovitis. • Osteoarthritis with CPPD chronic polyarticular osteoarthritis with superimposed acute CPP attacks. Risk factors Old age, hyperparathyroidism (see p222), haemochromatosis (see p288), hypophosphataemia (see p679). Tests Polarized light microscopy of synovial fl uid shows weakly positively birefringent crystals (fi g 12.11). It is associated with soft tis- sue calcium deposition on x-ray. Management Acute attacks: cool packs, rest, aspira- tion, and intra-articular steroids. NSAIDS (+PPI) ± colchicine 0.5–1.0mg/24h (used with caution) may prevent acute attacks. Methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine may be considered for chronic CPP infl ammatory arthritis.36 __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 554488 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolotamuehR 549 Fig 12.8 Acute monoarthritis in gout.
