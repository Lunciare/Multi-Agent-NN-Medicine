Viewed from the lithotomy position, the three anal cushions are at 3, 7, and 11 o’clock (where the three major arteries that feed the vascular plexuses enter the anal canal). They are attached by smooth muscle and elastic tissue, but are prone to displacement and disrup- tion, either singly or together. The eff ects of gravity (standing), increased anal tone (?stress), and the eff ects of straining at stool may make them become both bulky and loose, and so to protrude to form piles
