ygolotameaH 356 Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) Neoplastic proliferation of blast cells derived from marrow myeloid elements. It progresses rapidly (death in ~2 months if untreated; ~20% 3yr survival after ). Incidence The commonest acute leukaemia of adults (1/10 000/yr; increases with age). AML can be a long-term complication of chemotherapy, eg for lymphoma. Also associated with myelodysplastic states (see BOX ‘Myelodysplastic syndromes’), ra- diation, and syndromes, eg Down’s. Morphological classifi cation There is much heterogeneity (see BOX ‘Heterogene- ity in AML’). Four types based on WHO histological classifi cation, cytogenetics, and molecular genetics: 1 AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities. 2 AML multilineage dysplasia (eg 2° to pre-existing myelodysplastic syndrome). 3 AML, therapy related (in those previously treated with cytotoxic drugs). 4 AML, other (not fi tting above-listed; further subclassifi ed as M0–M7 by maturation). Signs and symptoms • Marrow failure: Anaemia, infection, or bleeding. DIC oc- curs in acute promyelocytic leukaemia, a subtype of AML, where there is release of thromboplastin (p352). • Infi ltration: Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, gum hypertro- phy (fi g 8.50), skin involvement. CNS involvement at presentation is rare. Diagnosis WCC is often , but can be normal or even low. Blast cells may be few in the
