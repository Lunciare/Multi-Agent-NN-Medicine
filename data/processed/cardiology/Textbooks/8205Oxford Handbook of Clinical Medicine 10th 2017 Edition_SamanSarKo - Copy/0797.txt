need for RRT to avoid the infection risk associated with central venous dialysis catheters. HD is needed 3 times/week or more. Daily HD increases the ‘dose’ and improves outcomes. Home HD should be off ered to all suitable patients. Problems: Access (arteriovenous fi stula: thrombosis, stenosis, steal syndrome; tunnelled venous line: infection, block- age, recirculation of blood), dialysis dysequilibrium (between cerebral and blood sol- utes leading to cerebral oedema  start HD gradually), hypotension, time consuming. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) Uses the peritoneum as a semi-permeable membrane. A catheter is inserted into the peritoneal cavity and fl uid infused. Solutes diff use slowly across. Ultrafi ltration is achieved by adding osmotic agents (glucose, glu- cose polymers) to the fl uid. It is a continuous process with intermittent drainage and refi lling of the peritoneal cavity, performed at home. Problems: Catheter site infection, PD peritonitis, hernia, loss of membrane function over time. Haemofi ltration (fi g 7.7) Water cleared Post by positive pressure, dragging solutes into Blood Blood dilution the waste by convection. The ultrafi ltrate Pre- in returned (waste) is replaced with an appropriate dilution Blood volume of (‘clean’) fl uid either before (pre- dilution) or after (post-dilution) the mem- brane.
