heart sound. There may be signs of heart failure (JVP, 3rd heart sound, basal crepitations) or a pansystolic murmur (papillary muscle dysfunction/rupture, VSD). Low-grade fever may be present. Later, a pericardial friction rub or peripheral oedema may develop. Tests ECG: (See fi g 3.21.) STEMI: classically, hyperacute (tall) T waves, ST elevation, or new LBBB occur within hours. T-wave inversion and pathological Q waves follow over hours to days (p98). NSTEMI/unstable angina: ST depression, T wave inversion, non-specifi c changes, or normal. In 20% of MI, the ECG may be normal initially. Paced ECGs and ECGs with chronic bundle branch block are unhelpful for diagnos- ing NSTEMIs14 and may hinder STEMI15 diagnosis; in these cases, clinical assessment and troponin levels are especially important. CXR: Look for cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema, or a widened mediastinum. Don’t routinely delay treatment whilst waiting for a CXR. Blood: FBC, U&E, glucose, lipids, cardiac enzymes. Cardiac enzymes: (See BOX ’Troponin‘.) Cardiac troponin levels (T and I) are the most sensitive and spe- cifi c markers of myocardial necrosis. Diff erent hospitals use diff erent assays: check the required timing of troponin blood samples where you work (eg two samples 3h apart). Other cardiac enzymes (see fi
