of death from heart disease mirrors TSH even when in the normal range in women. Risk ≈ 1.4 if TSH 1.5–2.4 vs 1.7 if TSH 2.5–3.5. If TSH >3.65 and possibly symptomatic, a low dose of levothyroxine may be tried. Monitor symptoms, TSH and T4 carefully. Over-exposure to thyroxine may cause osteoporosis ± AF. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 222200 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE Why are symptoms of thyroid disease so various, and so subtle? 221 Almost all our cell nuclei have receptors showing a high affi nity for T3: that known as TR-1 is abundant in muscle and fat; TR-2 is abundant in brain; and TR-1 is abundant in brain, liver, and kidney. These receptors, via their infl uence on various enzymes, aff ect the following processes: • The metabolism of substrates, vitamins, and minerals. • Modulation of all other hormones and their target-tissue responses. • Stimulation of O2 consumption and generation of metabolic heat. • Regulation of protein synthesis, and carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. • Stimulation of demand for co-enzymes and related vitamins. Subclinical thyroid disease Subclinical hypothyroidism Suspect if TSH >4mU/L with normal T4 and T3, and no symptoms. It is common: ~10% of those >55yrs have TSH. Risk of progression to
