macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, azithromycin, etc), protease inhibitors (p402), SSRIs (p448), tricyclics. Azathioprine:  by: allopurinol. -blockers: Avoid verapamil.  by: NSAIDS. Lipophilic -blockers (eg propranolol) are metabolized by the liver, and concentrations are  by cimetidine. This does not happen with hydrophilic -blockers (eg atenolol). Carbamazepine:  by: erythromycin, isoniazid, verapamil. Ciclosporin:  by: erythromycin, grapefruit juice, nifedipine.  by: phenytoin. Cimetidine:  the eff ect of: amitriptyline, lidocaine, metronidazole, pethidine, phenytoin, propranolol, quinine, theophylline, warfarin. Contraceptive steroids:  by: antibiotics, barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin. Digoxin:  by: amiodarone, carbenoxolone and diuretics (due to K+), quinine, verapamil. Diuretics:  by: NSAIDS—particularly indometacin. Ergotamine:  by: erythromycin (ergotism may occur). Fluconazole: Avoid concurrent astemizole. Lithium:  by: thiazide diuretics. Methotrexate:  by: aspirin, NSAIDS. Many antibiotics (check BNF). Phenytoin:  by: chloramphenicol, cimetidine, disulfi ram, isoniazid, sulfonamides.  by: carbamazepine. Potassium-sparing diuretics with ACE-inhibitors: Hyperkalaemia. Theophyllines:  by: cimetidine, ciprofl oxacin, erythromycin, contraceptive steroids, propranolol.  by: barbiturates, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin. See p810. Valproate:  by: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin. Warfarin and nicoumalone: (Nicoumalone=acenocoumarol)  by: alcohol, allopu- rinol, amiodaro ne, aspirin, chloramphenicol, cimetidine, ciprofl oxacin, co-trimox- azole, danazol, dipyridamole, disulfi ram, erythromycin (and broad-spectrum antibiotics), gemfi brozil, glucagon, ketoconazole, metronidazole, miconazole,
