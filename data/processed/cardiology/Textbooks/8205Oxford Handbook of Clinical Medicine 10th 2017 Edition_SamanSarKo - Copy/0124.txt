In pain? Dyspnoeic? Are they pale, cold, and clammy? Can you hear the click of a prosthetic valve? Inspect for scars: median sternotomy (CABG; valve replacement; congenital heart disease). Inspect for any pacemakers/ internal cardiac defi brillators (ICDS). Look around the bed for oxygen and GTN spray. Hands Finger clubbing occurs in congenital cyanotic heart disease and endocardi- tis. Splinter haemorrhages, Osler’s nodes (tender nodules, eg in fi nger pulps) and Janeway lesions (red macules on palms, fi g 3.38, p151) are signs of infective endocar- ditis. If found, examine the fundi for Roth’s spots (retinal infarcts, p560). Are there nail fold infarcts (vasculitis, p556) or nailbed capillary pulsation (Quincke’s sign in aortic regurgitation)? Is there arachnodactyly (Marfan’s) or polydactyly (ASD)? Are there tendon xanthomata (see BOX ‘Hyperlipidaemia’)? Pulse See p42. Feel for radio-femoral delay (coarctation of the aorta) and radio- radial delay (eg from aortic arch aneurysm). Blood pressure (see BOX ‘An unusual BP measurement’) Systolic BP is the pressure at which
