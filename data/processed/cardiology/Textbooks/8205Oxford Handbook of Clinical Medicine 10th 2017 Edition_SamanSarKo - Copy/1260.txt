are known to have dementia, yet probably only half of cases are diagnosed. Diagnosis Is made by: History from the patient with a thorough collateral nar- rative—ask about the timeline of decline and the domains aff ected. Non-cognitive symptoms such as agitation, aggression, or apathy indicate late disease.5 Cognitive testing: Use a validated dementia screen such as the AMTS (p64) or similar, plus short tests of executive function and language. Carry out a mental state examination to identify anxiety, depression, or hallucinations. Examination may identify a physical cause, risk factors (eg for vascular dementia), or parkinsonism. Medication review is important to exclude drug-induced cognitive impairment. Investigations Look for reversible/organic causes: TSH/B12/folate (treat low- normals, p334), thiamine (eg alcohol), Ca2+. Check MSU, FBC, ESR, U&E, LFT, and glu- cose. An MRI (preferred to CT) can identify other reversible pathologies (eg subdural haematoma, p482; normal-pressure hydrocephalus11), as well as underlying vascular damage or structural pathology. Functional imaging (FDG, PET, SPECT) may help de- lineate subtypes where diagnosis is not clear. Consider EEG in: suspected delirium, frontotemporal dementia, CJD, or a seizure disorder. If clinically indicated then check autoantibodies, syphilis, HIV, CJD, or other rare causes (see later in topic). Subtypes • Alzheimer’s
