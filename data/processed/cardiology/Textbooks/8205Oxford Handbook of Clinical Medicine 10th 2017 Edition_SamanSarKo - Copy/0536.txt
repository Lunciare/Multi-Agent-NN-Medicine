toes, loss of transverse arch, rocker-bottom sole. Caused by loss of pain sensation, leading to mech anical stress and repeated joint injury. Swelling, instability, and deformity. Early recognition is vital (cellulitis or osteomyelitis are often misdiagnosed). Ischaemia If the foot pulses cannot be felt, do Doppler pressure measurements. Any evidence of neuropathy or vascular disease raises risk of foot ulceration. Educate (daily foot inspection—eg with a mirror for the sole; comfortable shoes). Regular chiropody to remove callus, as haemorrhage and tissue necrosis may oc- cur below, leading to ulceration. Treat fungal infections (p408). Surgery (including endovascular angioplasty balloons, stents, and subintimal recanalization) has a role. Foot ulceration Typically painless, punched-out ulcer (fi g 5.10) in an area of thick callus ± superadded infection. Causes cellulitis, abscess ± osteomyelitis. Assess degree of: 1 Neuropathy (clinically). 2 Ischaemia (clinically + Doppler ± angiography). 3 Bony deformity, eg Charcot joint (clinically + X-ray). See fi g 5.11. 4 Infection (swabs, blood culture, X-ray for osteomyelitis, probe ulcer to reveal depth). Management: Regular chiropody. Bed rest ± therapeutic shoes. For Charcot joints: bed rest/crutches/total contact cast until oedema and local warmth reduce and bony repair is complete (8wks). Bisphosphonates may help. Charcot joints are
