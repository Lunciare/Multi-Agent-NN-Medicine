to 40min (consider hyperbaric O2 if: pH<7.1; CNS signs; >25% COHb or >20% if pregnant). SpO2 (oxime try) is unreliable in CO poisoning. • Circulation: Partial thickness burns >10% in a child and >15% in adults require IV fl uid resuscitation. Put up 2 large-bore (14G or 16G) IV lines. Do not worry if you have to put these through burned skin; intraosseous access is valuable in infants and can be used in adults (see OHCS p236). Secure them well: they are literally lifelines. Use a burns calculator fl ow chart or a formula, eg: Parkland formula (popular): 4 ≈ weight (kg) ≈ % burn = mL Hartmann’s solution in 24h, half given in 1st 8h. Replace fl u- id from the time of burn, not from the time fi rst seen in hospital. Formulae are only guides: adjust IVI according to clinical response and urine output; aim for 0.5mL/kg/h (1mL/kg/h in children), ~50% more in electrical burns and inhalation injury. Monitor T° (core and surface); catheterize the bladder. Beware of over-resuscitation (‘fl uid creep’) which can lead to complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome. Treatment ‘Cool the burn, warm the patient.’ Do not apply cold water to extensive burns
