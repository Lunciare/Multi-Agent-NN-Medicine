focal seizure in the motor cortex (Todd’s palsy, p712), or dysphasia following a focal seizure in the temporal lobe. Causes ⅔ are idiopathic. Structural: Cortical scarring (eg head injury years be- fore onset), developmental (eg dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumour or corti- cal dysgenesis), space-occupying lesion, stroke, hippocampal sclerosis (eg after a febrile convulsion), vascular malformations. Others: Tuberous sclerosis, sarcoido- sis, SLE, PAN, antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels. Diagnosis Can be diffi cult due to the heterogenous nature of the disease (there are >40 diff erent types of epilepsy). NICE estimate 5–30% of people with ‘epilepsy’ have been wrongly diagnosed.  All patients with a seizure must be referred for specialist assessment and investigation in <2 wks. Take a thorough history: Including a detailed description from a witness. Ask spe- cifi cally about tongue-biting and a slow recovery. If this is a fi rst seizure, enquire about past funny turns/odd behaviour. Déjà vu and odd episodic feelings of fear may well be relevant. Are there any triggers (eg alcohol, stress, fl ickering lights/TV)? Triggered attacks tend to recur. Establish the type of seizure: See BOX ‘Seizure classifi cation’.7 NB: if a seizure be- gins with focal features, it is a partial seizure,
