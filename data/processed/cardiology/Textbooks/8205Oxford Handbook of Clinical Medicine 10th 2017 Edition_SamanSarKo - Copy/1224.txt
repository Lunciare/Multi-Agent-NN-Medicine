in situ. • Cardiac emboli (AF; endocarditis; MI—see BOX ‘Cardiac causes of stroke’, p473). • Atherothromboembolism (eg from carotids). • CNS bleeds (BP, trauma, aneurysm rupture, anticoagulation, thrombolysis). Other causes: Consider in younger pa- tients: sudden BP drop by ≥40mmHg (most likely to aff ect the boundary zone be- tween vascular beds), carotid artery dissection (spontaneous, or from neck trauma or fi bromuscular dysplasia), vasculitis, subarachnoid haemorrhage (p478), venous sinus thrombosis (p480), anti phos pho lipid syndrome, thrombophilia (p374), Fabry disease (p698), CADASIL.5 Diff erentials Head injury, hypo/hyperglycaemia, subdural haemorrhage, intracranial tumours, hemiplegic migraine, post-ictal (Todd’s palsy), CNS lymphoma, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, hepatic encephalopathy, encephalitis, toxoplasmosis, cerebral ab- scesses, mycotic aneurysm, drug overdose (if comatose). Modifi able risk factors BP, smoking, DM, heart disease (valvular, ischaemic, AF), peripheral vascular disease, PCV, carotid bruit, combined OCP, lipids, alcohol use, clotting (eg plasma fi brinogen, antithrombin III, p374), homocysteine, syphilis. Signs Worst at onset. Pointers to bleeding (unreliable!): meningism, severe head- ache, coma. Pointers to ischaemia: carotid bruit, AF, past TIA, IHD. Cerebral infarcts: (50%.) Depending on site there may be contralateral sensory loss or hemiplegia— initially fl accid (fl oppy limb, falls like a dead weight when lifted), becoming spastic (UMN); dysphasia;
