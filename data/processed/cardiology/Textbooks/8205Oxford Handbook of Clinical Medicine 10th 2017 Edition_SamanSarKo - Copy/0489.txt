Handbook of Clinical medicine

causes: RV thrombus (post-MI); septic emboli (right- sided endocarditis); fat, air, or amniotic fl uid embolism; neoplastic cells; parasites. Risk factors • Recent surgery, especially abdominal/pelvic or hip/knee replacement. • Thrombophilia, eg antiphospholipid syndrome (p374). • Leg fracture. • Prolonged bed rest/reduced mobility. • Malignancy. • Pregnancy/postpartum; combined contraceptive pill; HRT (lower risk). • Previous PE. Clinical features Small emboli may be asymptomatic, whereas large emboli are often fatal. Symptoms: Acute breathlessness, pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis; diz- ziness; syncope. Ask about risk factors, past history or family history of thromboem- bolism. Signs: Pyrexia; cyanosis; tachypnoea; tachycardia; hypotension; raised JVP; pleural rub; pleural eff usion. Look for signs of a cause, eg deep vein thrombosis. Tests • FBC, U&E, baseline clotting, D-dimers (BOX). • ABG may show PaO2 and PaCO2. • Imaging: CXR may be normal, or show oligaemia of aff ected segment, dilated pul- monary artery, linear atelectasis, small pleural eff usion, wedge-shaped opacities or cavitation (rare). CTPA—see fi g 4.16. • ECG may be normal, or show tachycardia, right bundle branch block, right vent- ricular strain (inverted T in V1 to V4). The classical SI QIII TIII pattern (p98) is rare. Further investigations are shown on p818. Treatment See
