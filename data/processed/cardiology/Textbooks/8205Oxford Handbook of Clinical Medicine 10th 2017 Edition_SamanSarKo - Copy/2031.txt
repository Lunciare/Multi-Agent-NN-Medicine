5–10mg IV (repeat after 5min if necessary). Give anti-emetic with the 1st dose of morphine: metoclopramide 10mg IV (1st line), or cyclizine 50mg IV (2nd line). • GTN: routine use now not recommended in the acute setting unless patient is hyper- tensive or in acute LVF. Useful as anti-anginal in chronic/stable patients. • Oxygen is recommended if patients have SaO2 <95%, are breathless or in acute LVF. • Restore coronary perfusion in those presenting <12h after symptom onset (see BOX). • Anticoagulation: An injectable anticoagulant must be used in primary PCI. Bivali- rudin is preferred, if not available use enoxaparin ± a GP IIb/IIIa blocker. • ß-blockers provide additional benefi t when started early, eg bisoprolol 2.5mg PO OD. Ensure no evidence of cardiogenic shock, heart failure, asthma/COPD, or heart block. Right ventricular infarction Confi rm by demonstrating ST elevation in rV3/4 and/ or echo. NB: rV4 means that V4 is placed in the right 5th intercostal space in the midclavicular line. Treat hypotension and oliguria with fl uids (avoid nitrates and diu- retics). Monitor BP carefully, and assess early signs of pulmonary oedema. Intensive monitoring and inotropes may be useful in some patients.  Reperfusion therapy Early coronary reperfusion
