jejunal tubes may be in- serted radiologically or surgically (ie gastrostomy/jejunostomy). Use for nutritionally complete, commercially prepared feeds. Close liaison with a dietician is essential. Polymeric feeds consist of undigested proteins, starches, and long-chain fatty acids (eg Nutrison standard®, Osmolite®). Normally contain ~1kCal/mL and 4–6g protein per 100mL. Typical requirements met with 2L/24h. Elemental feeds consist of indi- vidual amino acids, oligo- and monosaccharides needing minimal digestion. Feed is typically initiated at a slow, continuous rate (nausea and vomiting less problematic) but patients may build up to shorter, bolus feeds, freeing them from pumps between. Guidelines for success • Use fi ne-bore (9Fr) nasogastric feeding tube when possible. • Check position of nasogastric tube (pH testing) b efore starting feeding (p759); the positioning of a nasojejunal tube can be checked on abdominal X-ray. • Build up feeds gradually to avoid diarrhoea and distension. • Weigh at least weekly. • Check blood glucose and plasma electrolytes (monitor for refeeding syndrome if previously malnourished—p587). • Treat underlying conditions vigorously, eg sepsis may impede +ve nitrogen balance. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 558844 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Nil by mouth (NBM) before theatre 585 If in doubt about what is acceptable oral intake prior to induction for general
