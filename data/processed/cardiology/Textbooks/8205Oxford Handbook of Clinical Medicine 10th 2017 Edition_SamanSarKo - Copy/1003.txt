cause mild disease in mother but transplacental infectionplacentitis, amnionitis, preterm delivery, neonatal sepsis, intrauterine death. Diagnosis: culture: blood, placenta, amniotic fl uid, CSF. PCR. Serology is non- specifi c. Treatment: ampicillin plus gentamicin (synergistic action) for systemic disease. Also co-trimoxazole (CNS disease), macrolides, tetracycline, rifampicin, van- comycin, carbopenem. Resistant to cephalosporins which are often 1st-line empiri- cal treatment for meningitis so remember additional antimicrobial cover if listeria is a possibility. Clostridia: • Clostridium diffi cile, see p259, p411. • Clostridium perfringens: • Gastroenteritis, see p430. • Gas gangrene due to exotoxin production (alpha toxin most common). Previ- ously Clostridium welchii. Presentation: sudden, severe pain due to myonecro- sis, tissue crepitus, systemic shock. Most post surgery (GI, biliary), or following soft-tissue trauma/open fracture. If spontaneous, look for malignancy. Treat- ment: early recognition, surgical debridement, protein synthesis inhibitors, eg clindamycin inhibit toxins >penicillins. Hyperbaric O2 unproven in trials (fi g 9.4, table 9.7). • Clostridium botulinum, see p436. • Clostridium tetani, see p436. Diphtheria: Caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae toxin. Preventable with vaccine. Pres- entation: tonsillar pseudomembrane with fever, painful dysphagia, cervical lym- phadenopathy (see OHCS p158). Diagnosis: culture, toxin detection, PCR. Treatment: antitoxin within 48h. Benzylp enicillin/erythromycin. Airway support. Actinomycosis: Due to
