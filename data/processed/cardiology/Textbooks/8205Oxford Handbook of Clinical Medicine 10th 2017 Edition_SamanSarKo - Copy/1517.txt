The skill and persistence required to gently and atraumatically tease apart these fi brous bands that restrict access and vision makes any progression, no matter how slight, cause for subdued celebration. Perseverance is the name of this game. Surgical division of adhesions is known as adhesiolysis. Any surgical procedure that breaches the abdominal or pelvic cavities can predispose to the formation of adhesions, which are found in up to 90% of those with previous abdominal surgery; this is why we do not rush to operate on small bowel obstruction: the op- eration predisposes to yet more adhesions. Handling of the serosal surface of the bowel causes infl ammation, which over weeks to years can lead to the formation of fi brous bands that tether the bowel to
