• Bigeminy—ectopic every other beat, see fi g 3.34. ECG machines may disregard the second QRS and so calculate the rate to be half the true value. • Trigeminy—every third beat is an ectopic. • Couplet—two ectopics together. • Triplet—three ectopics together. Occasional ventricular ectopics24 in otherwise healthy people are extremely common and rarely signifi cant. Frequent ectopics (>60/hour), particularly couplets and tri- plets, should prompt testing for underlying cardiac conditions. Post-MI, ventricular ectopics are associated with increased risk of dangerous arrhythmias. Pay attention to whether the ectopics all ‘look’ the same on the ECG suggesting a single focus (monomorphic) or may come from multiple foci (polymorphic). Causes and manage- ment can be diff erent. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 112288 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 129 Fig 3.29 VF (p894). Fig 3.30 VT with a rate of 235/min.

This would not be expected if the QRS breadth were down to bundle branch block or metabolic causes. Fig 3.34 Bigeminy—a normal QRS is followed by a ventricular ectopic beat *
