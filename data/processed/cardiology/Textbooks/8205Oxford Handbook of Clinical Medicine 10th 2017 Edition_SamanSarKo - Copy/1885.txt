abdomen, cropped to show the pancreas. Top panel—unenhanced image, middle panel—arterial phase of contrast medium to look for pseudocysts and pa- renchymal enhancement, bottom panel—portal venous phase to look at veins. The history here was also central abdominal pain with a non-peritonitic abdomen. The CT shows an en- larged pancreatic head with fat stranding around the duodenopancreatic groove (‘groove pancreatitis’), and two small areas of fl uid attenuation posteriorly, likely to be pseudocysts.

Thus… • Placing the human body in a magnetic fi eld aligns its hydrogen nuclei either with (parallel) or against (anti-parallel) the fi eld. • A radiofrequency (RF) pulse at the resonant frequency fl ips a few nuclei away from their original alignment by an angle depending on the amount of energy they absorb. • When the RF pulse stops, the nuclei fl ip back (or relax) into their original alignment,
