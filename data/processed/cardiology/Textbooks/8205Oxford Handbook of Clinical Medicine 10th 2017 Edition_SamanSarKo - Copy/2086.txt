(see below) before the exact cause is known—usually viral, and often never identifi ed. Without the infec- tious prodrome consider encephalopathy: hypoglycaemia, hepatic encephalopathy, diabetic ketoacidosis, drugs, hypoxic brain injury, uraemia, SLE, Wernicke’s (give vit B1 if in doubt p714). Signs and symptoms • Bizarre encephalopathic behaviour or confusion. • GCS or coma. • Fever. • Headache. • Focal neurological signs. • Seizures. • History of travel or animal bite. Causes • Viral: HSV-1 & 2, arboviruses, CMV, EBV, VZV (varicella-zoster virus), HIV (seroconver- sion), measles, mumps, rabies, Japanese B encephalitis, West Nile virus, tick-borne encephalitis. • Non-viral: Any bacterial meningitis, TB, malaria, listeria, Lyme disease, legionella, leptospirosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcus, schistosomiasis, typhus. Investigations • Bloods: Blood cultures; serum for viral PCR (also throat swab and MSU); toxoplasma IgM titre; malaria fi lm. • Contrast-enhanced CT: Focal bilateral temporal lobe involvement is suggestive of HSV encephalitis. Meningeal enhancement suggests meningoencephalitis. Do be- fore LP. MRI is alternative if allergic to contrast. • LP: Typically moderately CSF protein and lymphocytes, and glucose (p822). Send CSF for viral PCR including HSV. • EEG: Urgent EEG showing diff use abnormalities may help confi rm a diagnosis of encephalitis, but does not indicate a cause.
