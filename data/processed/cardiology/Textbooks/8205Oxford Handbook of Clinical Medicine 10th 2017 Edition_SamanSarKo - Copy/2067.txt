<88% or PaO2 <7 kPa: Start at 24–28%, aim sats 88–92% Adjust according to ABG, aim PaO2 >8.0kPa with a rise in PaCO2 <1.5kPa Steroids: IV hydrocortisone 200mg and oral prednisolone 30mg OD (continue for 7–14d) Antibiotics: Use if evidence of infection, eg amoxicillin 500mg/8h PO, alternatively clarithromycin or doxycycline (p387) Physiotherapy to aid sputum expectoration If no response to nebulizers and steroids: Consider IV aminophylline* If no response: 1 Consider non-invasive positive pressure ventilation† (NIPPV) if respiratory rate >30 or pH <7.35, or PaCO2 rising despite best medical treatment. OR: 2 Consider a respiratory stimulant drug, eg doxapram1 .5–4mg/ min IV in patients who are not suitable for mechanical ventila- tion. SE: agitation, confusion, tachycardia, nausea. It is a short-term measure, used only if NIV is not available Consider intubation and ventilation if pH <7.26 and PaCO2 is rising despite non-invasive ventilation only where appropriate (see ‘Consider the ceiling of care’ in text) *Load with 250mg over 20min, then infuse at a rate of ~500mcg/kg/h (300mcg/kg/h if elderly), where kg is ideal body weight. Do not give a loading dose to patients on maintenance methylxanthines (theophyllines/ aminophylline; see p811). Check plasma levels if given for >24h. ECG monitoring is
