of water, 0 Hounsfi eld units (HU), and air, Ω1000HU. The human eye and display systems have a limited greyscale range, so diff erent settings (levels and ‘windows’) are used to focus on diff erences in attenuation in ranges typical for tissues of diff erent density, eg bone or lung (fi g 16.11). CTS are responsible for up to 40% of iatrogenic radiation in high-use settings, which could account for ~1% of all cancers: always balance benefi ts of CT vs other modali- ties with less or no radiation (ultrasound; MRI), particularly in the young or in those with chronic disease likely to undergo multiple imaging investigations. Discuss with a radiologist—there are several technical aspects of imaging that can limit radiation dose whilst still providing clinically useful information. Imaging of choice for • Staging and monitoring most malignant disease. • Intracranial pathology, eg stroke, trauma, ICP, and space-occupying lesions. • Trauma. • Pre-operative assessment of complex masses. • Assessment of acute abdomen (fi gs 16.15, 16.16). NB ultrasound increasingly used (p736). • Following abdominal surgery. Contrast medium (p748) Enhance anatomical detail by use of a high- or low (water)-attenuating medium to fi ll the lumen of a structure. Give IV
