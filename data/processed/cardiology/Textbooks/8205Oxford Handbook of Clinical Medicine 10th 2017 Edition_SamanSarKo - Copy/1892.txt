studies, and echocardiography. Advantages Portable; fast; non-ionizing; cheap; real-time; can be used with interven- tion; can enter organs, eg rectum, vagina, bowel. Endoscopic US can be used to stage and biopsy lung and GI tract cancers, eg stomach, pancreas, and also image the heart = transoesophageal echocardiogram or TOE, p110. Disadvantages Operator dependent—interoperator variability high; poor quality if patient is obese; interference from bone, bowel gas, calculi, or superimposed organs can limit depth and quality of imaging.

Distal obstruction of the CBD causes proximal dilatation of the duct. It is important to correlate the width of the CBD with the ALP, as the normal diameter varies with age and previous interventions. Also check that the distal CBD tapers as it enters the duodenum. NB: the portal vein lies posterior to the duct (along with the hepatic artery) in the free edge of the lesser omentum. Next, ask
