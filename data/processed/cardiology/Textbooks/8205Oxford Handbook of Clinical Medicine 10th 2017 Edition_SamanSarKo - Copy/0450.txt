abscess; amyloidosis. Tests Sputum culture. CXR: Cystic shadows, thickened bronchial walls (tramline and ring shadows); see fi g 4.7. HRCT chest (p164) to assess extent and distribution of disease. Spirometry often shows an obstructive pattern; reversibility should be as- sessed. Bronchoscopy to locate site of haemoptysis, exclude obstruction and obtain samples for culture. Other tests: Serum immunoglobulins; CF sweat test; Aspergillus precipitins or skin-prick test RAST and total IgE. Management •Airway clearance techniques and mucolytics. Chest physi- otherapy and devices such as a fl utter valve may aid sputum expectoration and mucus drainage. •Antibiotics should be prescribed according to bacterial sensitivi- ties. Patients known to culture Pseudomonas will require either oral ciprofl oxacin or suitable IV antibiotics. If ≥3 exacerbations a year consider long-term antibiotics (may be nebulized). •Bronchodilators (eg nebulized salbutamol) may be useful in patients with asthma, COPD, CF, ABPA (p177). •Corticosteroids (eg prednisolone) and itraconazole for ABPA. •Surgery may be indicated in localized disease or to control severe haemoptysis.
