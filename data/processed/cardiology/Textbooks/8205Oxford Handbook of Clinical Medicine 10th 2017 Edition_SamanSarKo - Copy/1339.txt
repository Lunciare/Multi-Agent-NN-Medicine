itself or antiret- roviral therapy. Up to 30% of patients have a peripheral neuropathy, which is pain- ful and predominantly sensory. Other clinical pictures include polyradiculopathy, mononeuritis multiplex, and proximal myopathy. Chronic HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND): While antiretroviral ther- apy (ART) has decreased the incidence of CNS complications in HIV/AIDS, people are living longer with the disease, and chronic complications such as HIV-associated de- mentia are increasing. This occurs in 7–15%, late in the disease, and usually when the CD4 count is <200. Progressive behavioural changes are seen along with subcortical features: memory loss, poor attention, and bradykinesia. Various encephalopathies may also contribute to this, eg PML. Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV-1) Is another retrovirus with neurologi- cal manifestations, though much more rarely than HIV (~0.5%). It causes: Tropical spastic paraplegia, a slowly progressing myelopathy, typically aff ecting the tho- racic area. There may be paraesthesiae, sensory loss, and disorders of micturition. Demyelinating polyneuropathy and ataxia may also occur.
