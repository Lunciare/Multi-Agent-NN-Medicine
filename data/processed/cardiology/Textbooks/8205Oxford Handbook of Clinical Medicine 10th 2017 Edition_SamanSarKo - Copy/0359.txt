together as congestive cardiac failure (CCF). Acute heart failure: Often used exclusively to mean new-onset acute or decom- pensation of chronic heart failure characterized by pulmonary and/or peripheral oedema with or without signs of peripheral hypo perfusion. Chronic heart failure: Develops or progresses slowly. Venous congestion is common but arterial pressure is well maintained until very late. Low-output heart failure: Cardiac output is  and fails to  normally with exertion. Causes: • Excessive preload: eg mitral regurgitation or fl uid overload (eg renal failure or too rapid IV infusions, particularly in the elderly and those with established HF). • Pump failure: systolic and/or diastolic HF (see above), heart rate (eg -blockers, heart block, post MI), negatively inotropic drugs (eg most antiarrhythmic agents). • Chronic excessive afterload: eg aortic stenosis, hypertension. Excessive preload can cause ventricular dilatation, this exacerbates pump failure. Excessive afterload prompts ventricular muscle thickening (ventricular hypertro- phy), resulting in stiff walls and diastolic dysfunction. High-output heart failure: This is rare. Here, output is normal or increased in the face of needs. Failure occurs when cardiac output fails to meet these needs. It will occur with a normal heart, but even earlier if there is heart disease. Causes:
