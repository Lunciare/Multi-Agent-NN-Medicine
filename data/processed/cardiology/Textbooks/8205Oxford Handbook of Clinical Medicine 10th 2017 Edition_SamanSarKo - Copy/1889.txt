C5/6 levels caused by degenerative disease. C2 (axis) is identifi able from the odontoid peg, which is embryologically derived from the body of C1 (atlas). Courtesy of Norwich Radiology Department. Fig 16.19 Axial T1-weighted MRI of the brain post-IV gadolinium. In the right temporo-parietal region there is a small area of high signal enhancement with a more central area of low signal, sur- rounded by a region of low signal (pre- sumably vasogenic cerebral oedema) in comparison to the normal brain tissue. This is all causing mass eff ect with ef- facement of the sulci and adjacent right frontal horn of the lateral ventricle. There is very subtle midline shift. Courtesy of Norwich Radiology Department. Fig 16.20 Axial T2-weighted MRI of the same patient at the same level as fi g 16.19. The high signal in the temporo- parietal region is the oedema causing mass eff ect. The diagnosis was of a solitary metastasis. In this T2-weighted image the oedema and the cerebrospi- nal fl uid are of high signal due to their water content.
