There is no awkward peak, so good if nocturnal hypoglycaemia is an issue. Caution if considering pregnancy. Insulin detemir is similar and has a role in intensive insulin regimens for overweight type 2 DM. Common insulin regimens Plan the regimen to suit the lifestyle, not vice versa. Disposable pens: dial dose; insert needle 90° to skin.
