of endocarditis. If right-sided heart failure/tricuspid regurgitation, JVP does not refl ect fl uid state. • Respiratory: Pulmonary oedema or eff usion. • Abdomen: PD catheter or scars from previous catheter (small scars just below umbilicus and to side of midline), signs of previous transplant (scar, palpable graft), ballotable polycystic kidneys ± palpable liver. Investigation • Blood: U&E (compare with previous), Hb (normochromic, normocytic anaemia), glucose (DM), Ca2+, PO43 Ω, PTH (renal osteodystrophy). Directed investigation of intrinsic renal disease: ANA, ANCA, antiphospholipid antibodies, paraprotein, complement, cryoglobulin, anti-GBM, hepatitis serology, anti-PLA2R (membranous nephropathy). Note: ESR is not helpful as  in CKD and proteinuric states. • Urine: Dipstick, MC&S, A:CR or P:CR (p294), Bence Jones. • Imaging: USS for size, symmetry, anatomy, corticomedullary diff erentiation, and to exclude obstruction. In CKD kidneys may be small (<9cm) except in infi ltrative disorders (amyloid, myeloma), APKD, and DM. If asymmetrical consider renovas- cular disease. Scarring may be seen on USS but isotope scans are more sensitive. • Histology: Consider renal biopsy (p310) in progressive disease, nephrotic syn- drome, systemic disease, AKI without recovery. Biopsy is unlikely to change treat- ment if GFR stable and P:CR <150. DM with neuropathy/retinopathy may not need biopsy
