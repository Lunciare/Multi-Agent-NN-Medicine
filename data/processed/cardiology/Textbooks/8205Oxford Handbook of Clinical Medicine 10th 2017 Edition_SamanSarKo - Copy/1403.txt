Reactive (gout, CPPD) arthritis arthritis Osteoarthritis Reactive arthritis, eg Yersinia, Osteoarthritis Psoriatic Salmonella, Campylobacter arthritis Trauma Ankylosing spondylitis Viruses (eg (haemarthrosis) hepatitis A, B, & C; mumps) Osteoarthritis Systemic conditions* (can be either) *Connective tissue disease (eg SLE and relapsing polychondritis), sarcoidosis, malignancy (eg leukaemia), endocarditis, haemochromatosis, sickle-cell anaemia, familial Mediterranean fever, Behçet’s. Exclude septic arthritis in any acutely infl amed joint, as it can destroy a joint in under 24h (p544). Infl ammation may be less overt if immunocompromised (eg from the many immunosuppressive drugs used in rheumatological conditions) or if there is underlying joint disease. Joint aspiration (p541) is the key investigation, and if you are unable to do it, fi nd someone who can. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 553399 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolotamuehR 540 Assessing the locomotor system This aims to screen for rheumatological conditions primarily aff ecting mobility (as a consequence of underlying joint disease). It is based on the GALS locomotor screen (Gait, Arms, Legs, Spine). 1 Essence ‘Look, feel, and move’ (active and passive).
