Check your hospital’s policy for managing dia- betic patients who will be NBM before surgery. A general guide follows.

If PM list, give the normal morning bolus insulin, or half the mixed insulin dose. • If eating and drinking post-operatively, resume the usual insulin with evening meal. If AM list (or early PM) and eating a late lunch, give half the morning insulin dose with this meal. If not eating until evening, a VRIII may be needed if the capillary glucose readings are high. • Omit all rapid-acting and mixed insulin while the patient is on a VRIII. • It
