Assess vascular risk BP control (see BOX ‘Controlling blood pressure in diabetes’) is crucial for preventing macrov ascular disease and mortality. Refer to smoking ces- sation services. Check plasma lipids. Look for complications •Check injection sites for infection or lipohypertrophy (fatty change): advise on rotating sites of injection if present. • Vascular disease: Chief cause of death. MI is 4-fold commoner in DM and is more likely to be ‘silent’. Stroke is twice as common. Women are at high risk—DM re- moves the vascular advantage conferred by the female sex. Address other risk factors—diet, smoking, hypertension (p93). Suggest a statin (eg atorvastatin 20mg nocte) for all, even if no overt IHD, vascular disease, or microa lbuminuria. Aspirin 75mg reduces vascular events (in context of secondary prevention). Safe to use in diabetic retinopathy.11 • Nephropathy: (p314.) Microalbuminuria is when urine dipstick is Ωve for protein but the urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UA:CR) is 3mg/mmol
