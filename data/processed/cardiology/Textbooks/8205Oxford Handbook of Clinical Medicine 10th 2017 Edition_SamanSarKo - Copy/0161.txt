Exercise intolerance is the main symptom (from heart compr ession—consider CXR/CT). Indications for surgical correction (rarely needed): ≥2: a severe, symptomatic deformity; progression of deformity; paradoxical respiratory chest wall motion; pectus index >3.25 on CT; cardiac or lung compression; restrictive spirometry; cardiac pathology that might be from compression of the heart. Psychological eff ects are interesting and not to be dismissed as their eff ects may be greater than any physical eff ects.8
