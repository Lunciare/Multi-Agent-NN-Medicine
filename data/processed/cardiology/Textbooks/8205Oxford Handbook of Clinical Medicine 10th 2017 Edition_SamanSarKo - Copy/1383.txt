preparation (eg MST Continus® 12h). Transdermal preparations are available: seek expert help for dose, check adhesion, and rotate site. Use a PRN dose for breakthrough pain: 1/10th–1/6th of the total daily dose as an immediate-release preparation, eg Oramorph® or Sevredol®. Side-effects: Drowsiness, nausea/vomiting (usually  after 5 days), constipation, dry mouth. If diffi culty tolerating morphine, or pain plus toxicity, consider an opi- oid switch (eg oxycodone) and  dose by 25–30%. Toxicity: Sedation, respiratory depression, visual hallucinations, myoclonic jerks, delirium. Be alert: recognizing toxicity early usually means naloxone is avoided. Monitor pulse oximetry, give oxygen if required. Consider : intracranial bleed, renal failure.  Opioids and sedating drugs. Consider hydration. Seek expert help if remains opioid-toxic or in pain. Naloxone is only indicated for life-threatening respiratory depression (see p842). In patients on regular opiates it can precipitate a pain crisis and potentially fatal acute withdrawal.18 Renal failure: Patients with renal impairment (eGFR <30) are at risk of toxicity due to accumulation of renally excreted opioids and metabolites. Monitor closely. Fentanyl, alfentanil, and buprenorphine have predominantly hepatic metabolism —seek expert advice. Concerns: Patients may shrink from using opioids. Misconceptions are common: they are addictive, for the dying, if they use
