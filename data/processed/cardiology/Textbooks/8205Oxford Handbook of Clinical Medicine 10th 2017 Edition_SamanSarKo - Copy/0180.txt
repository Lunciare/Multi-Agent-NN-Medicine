Palmar erythema (chronic liver disease, pregnancy), Dupuytren’s contracture (thickening and fi brous contraction of palmar fascia (see fi g 2.26, p60; alcoholic liver disease)). Hepatic fl ap/asterixis (hepatic encephalopa- thy, uraemia from renal disease), check pulse and respiratory rate (infection/sepsis?), palpate for AV fi stulae in the forearm (haemodialysis access in renal failure). Face Assess for jaundice, anaemia, xanthelasma (PBC, chronic obstruction), Kayser–Fleis- cher rings (green-yellow ring at corneal margin seen in Wilson’s disease).
