Check pH, consider catheterization to monitor output and pH. 3 Correct acidosis. If plasma salicylate level >500mg/L (3.6mmol/L) or severe metabolic acidosis, consider alkalinization of the urine, eg with 1.5L 1.26% so- dium bicarbonate IV over 3h. Aim for urine pH 7.5–8. NB: monitor serum K+ as hypokalaemia may occur, and should be treated (caution if AKI). 4 Dialysis may well be needed if salicylate level >700mg/L, and if AKI or heart failure, pulmonary or cerebral oedema, confusion or seizures, severe acidosis despite best medical therapy, or persistently plasma salicylate. Contact neph- rology early. Discuss any serious cases with the local toxicological service or national poisons information service. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 884444 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 845 120 0.8 110 Treatment line 0.7 100 90 0.6 80 0.5 70 60 0.4 50 0.3 40 30 0.2 20 0.1 10 0 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 Time (hours) Fig 19.26 Plasma concentration of paracetamol vs time, see p844 for interpretation.
