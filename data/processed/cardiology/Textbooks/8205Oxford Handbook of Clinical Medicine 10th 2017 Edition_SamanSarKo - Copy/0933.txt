(there is synergism). Ibrutinib, chlorambucil, bendamustine, and ofatumumab all have a role.Steroids help autoimmune haemolysis. Radiotherapy helps lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Stem-cell transplantation may have a role in carefully selected patients. Supportive care: Transfusions, IV human im- munoglobulin if recurrent infection. Natural history ⅓ never progress (or even regress), ⅓ progress slowly, and ⅓ pro- gress actively. CD23 and 2 microglobulin correlate with bulk of disease and rates of progression. Death is often due to infection or transformation to aggressive lym- phoma (Richter’s syndrome).

These accumulate in the lymph nodes causing lymphadenopathy, but may also be found in pe- ripheral blood or infi ltrate organs. Lymphomas are histologically divided into Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s types. In Hodgkin’s lymphoma,7 characteristic cells with mirror-im- age nuclei are found, called Reed–Sternberg cells (fi gs 8.58–8.60). Incidence Two peaks: young adults (HL is the commonest malignancy in 15–24yr olds) and elderly. : ≈ 2:1. Risk factors: An aff ected sibling; EBV
