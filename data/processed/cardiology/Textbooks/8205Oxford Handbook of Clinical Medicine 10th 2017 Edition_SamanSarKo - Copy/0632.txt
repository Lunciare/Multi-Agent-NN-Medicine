fi rst. Do biopsies—macro- scopic appearances may be normal, eg IBD, amyloidosis, microscopic colitis. Colonoscopy Indications: See table 6.3. Preparation: Stop iron 1wk prior; dis- cuss with local endoscopy unit bowel preparation and diet required. Procedure: Do PR fi rst. Sedation (see earlier in topic) and analgesia are given before colonoscope is passed and guided around the colon. Complications: Abdominal discomfort; incom- plete examination; haemorrhage after biopsy or polypectomy; perforation (<0.1%). See fi gs 6.7–6.11. Post-procedure: no alcohol, and no operating machinery for 24h. Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) To evaluate obscure GI bleeding (p326) and to detect small bowel pathology. Use small bowel imaging (eg contrast) or patency capsule test ahead of VCE if patient has abdominal pain or symptoms suggesting small bowel obstruction. Preparation: Clear fl uids only the evening before then nil by mouth from morning until 4h after capsule swallowed. Procedure: Capsule is swallowed (fi g 6.12)—this transmits video wirelessly to cap- ture device worn by patient. Normal activity can take place for the day. Complications: Capsule retention in 1% (endo- scopic or surgical removal is needed)—avoid MRI for 2 wks after unless AXR confi rms capsule has cleared; obstruction, incomplete exam (eg slow transit, achalasia).
