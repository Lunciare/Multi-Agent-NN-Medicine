disease) 435 Zoonotic disease caused by tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus. Clinically impor- tant disease forms in humans are: • Cystic echinococcosis (hydatid disease, hydatosis): E. granulosus. Found world- wide. Usual host is dog. Also goats, swine, horses, cattle, camels, yaks. • Alveolar echinococcosis: E. multilocularis. Found in northern hemisphere. Usual hosts are foxes and rodents. Human ingest parasite eggs via food/water contaminated by animal faeces, or by handing animals which are infected with the tapeworm. Disease is due to the devel- opment of cyst-like larvae in viscera, usually liver/lungs. Presentation: Slow grow- ing cysts may be asymptomatic for many years. Symptoms and signs depends on location: • Liver: abdominal pain, nausea, hepatomegaly, obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, PUO. • Lung:: dyspnoea, chest pain, cough, haemoptysis. • CNS: space-occupying signs. • Bone: an interesting osteolytic cause of knee pain, cord compression. • Silent disease in breast, kidney, adrenals, bladder, heart, psoas. Diagnosis: USS/CT/MRI: avascular fl uid-fi lled cysts ± calcifi cation ( benign cyst, TB, mycoses, abscess, neoplasm). Serology. Positive echinococcal antigen. Treatment: Get help (including surgical). Depends on cyst type, location, size, and complications. Prolonged treatment (months/years) with albendazole. PAIR: Puncture, Aspirate, Inject (hypertonic saline/chemicals), Reaspirate. Beware spillage of cyst contents:
