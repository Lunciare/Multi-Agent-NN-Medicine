Contrast medium is usually admin- istered by the following routes: • PO: Barium- or iodine-based agents for, eg swallow or enhancing visualization of bowel lumen on CT. • Inhaled: Technetium or xenon used in ventilation scintigraphy. • IV: (Most widespread clinical application.) Iodine or gadolinium. • PR: Air or CO 2 can be introduced to the colon for CT colonography, iodinated con- trast medium is used for water-soluble enemas. Iodine-based contrast agents Iodine is used because of its relatively high elec- tron density and good physiological tolerance. When used with CT, the exami- nation is said to be contrast enhanced—look for ‘+ c’ amongst the scan details. Exercise caution in: renal or cardiac impairment; myeloma; diabetes;
