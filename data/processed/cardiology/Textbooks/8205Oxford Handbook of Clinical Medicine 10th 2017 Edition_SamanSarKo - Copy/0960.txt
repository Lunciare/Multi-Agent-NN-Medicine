feature (fi g 8.74). : optimize nutrition; PO melphalan + prednisolone extends survival. High-dose IV melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation may be better. AA amyloid (secondary amyloidosis) Here amyloid is derived from serum amyloid A, an acute phase protein, refl ecting chronic infl ammation in rheumatoid arthritis, UC/Crohn’s, familial Mediterranean fever, and chronic infections—TB, bronchiectasis, osteomyelitis. It aff ects kidneys, liver, and spleen (fi g 8.75), and may present with proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, or hepatosplenomegaly. Macroglossia is not seen; cardiac involvement is rare (ventricular hypertrophy and murmurs). : manage the underlying condition optimally. Familial amyloidosis (Autosomal dominant, eg from mutations in transthyretin, a transport protein produced by the liver.) Usually causes a sensory or autonomic neuropathy ± renal or cardiac involvement. Liver transplant can cure. Diagnosis: Made with biopsy of aff ected tissue, and positive Congo Red staining with apple-green birefringence under polarized light microscopy. The rectum or subcutaneous fat are relatively non-invasive sites for biopsy and are +ve in 80%. Prognosis: Median survival is 1–2 years. Patients with myeloma and amyloidosis have a shorter survival than those with myeloma alone. 9 Electrophoresis and plasmapheresis look as though they should share endings, but they do not: Greek phoros =
