if >14d or dysentery: FBC, U&E, LFT, infl amma- tory markers, stool microscopy for ova/cysts/parasites (historically 3 samples but may not actually improve diagnostic yield, time intensive), molecular testing for (pre-defi ned) microbes.  of persistent diarrhoea = Giardia (most common diag- nosis, send PCR), Entamoeba histolytica, Shigella. Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion (in up to 30%). Do not forget: malaria, HIV. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 442299 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI 430 Gastroenteritis: specifi c infections Diarrhoea without blood Norovirus: Single-stranded RNA virus. Highly infectious. Transmission by contact with infected people, environment, food (~10%). Most common cause of infectious GI disease, ~600 000 cases in England/yr. Presentation: 12–48h after exposure, lasting 24–72h: acute-onset vomiting, watery diarrhoea, cramps, nausea. Virus shed in stool even if asymptomatic. Numerous genotypes and unknown longevity of immunity  repeat infection occurs. Diagnosis: clinical, stool sample reverse transcriptase PCR. Treatment: supportive, anti-motility agents, usually self-limiting. Rotavirus: Double-stranded RNA virus. Wheel-like appearance on EM  ‘rota’. Com- monest cause of gastroenteritis in children (~50%). Most infected by 5y. Presenta- tion: incubation ~2d. Watery diarrhoea and vomiting for 3–8d, fever, abdominal pain. Diagnosis: clinical, antigen in stool. Treatment: supportive. Routine vaccination in UK (p407). Virus shed in
