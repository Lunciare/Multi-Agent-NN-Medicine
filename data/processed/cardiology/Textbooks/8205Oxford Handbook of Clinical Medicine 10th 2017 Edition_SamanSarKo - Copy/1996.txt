value may be acceptable if it is stable—eg after a large infarction. • Setting the pacemaker: Set the output to 3V or over 3 times the threshold value (whichever is higher) in ‘demand’ mode. Set the rate as required. Suture the wire to the skin, and fi x with a sterile dressing. • Check the position of the wire (and exclude pneumothorax) with a CXR. • Recurrent checks of the pacing threshold are required over the next few days. The formation of endocardial oedema can raise the threshold by a factor of 2–3. Complications Pneumothorax; sepsis; cardiac perforation; pacing failure: from loss of capture, loss of electrical continuity in pacing circuit, or electrode displacement. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 777766 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 serudecorp lacitcarP 777 Fig 18.19 Siting a temporary cardiac pacemaker. Non-invasive transcutaneous cardiac pacing This method (performed through a defi brillator with external pacing facility) has the advantages of being quicker, less risky than the transvenous route, and easier to perform. Its main disadvantage is the pain caused by skeletal muscle contrac- tion in the non-sedated patient. Indications for pacing via the transcutaneous route are as p776, plus if transvenous pacing (or someone able to perform it) is unavailable or will be
