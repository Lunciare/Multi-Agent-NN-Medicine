in solar keratoses (see later in topic), or be found on the lips of smokers or in long-standing ulcers (=Marjolin’s ulcer). Metastasis to lymph nodes is rare, local destruction may be extensive. : excision + radiotherapy to treat recurrence/aff ected nodes. See fi g 13.17. NB: the condition may be confused with a keratoacanthoma—a fast-growing, benign, self-limiting papule plugged with keratin. 3 Basal cell carcinoma: (AKA rodent ulcer) Nodular: typically a pearly nodule with rolled telangiectatic edge, on the face or a sun-exposed site. May have a central ulcer. See fi g 13.18. Metastases are very rare. It slowly causes local destruction if left untreated. Superfi cial: lesions appear as red scaly plaques with a raised smooth edge, often on the trunk or shoulders. Cause: (most frequently) UV exposure. : excision; cryotherapy; for superfi cial BCCS topical fl urouracil or imiquimod (see as for ‘Solar keratoses’). Pre-malignant tumours 1 Solar (actinic) keratoses appear on sun-exposed skin as crumbly, yellow-white crusts. Malignant change to squamous cell carcinoma may occur after several years. Treatment: cryotherapy; 5% fl uorouracil cream or 5% imiquimod—work by causing: erythema  vesiculation  erosion  ulceration  necrosis  healing epithelialization, leaving healthy skin unharmed.
