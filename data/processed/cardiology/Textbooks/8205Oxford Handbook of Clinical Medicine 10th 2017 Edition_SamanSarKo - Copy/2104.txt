pancreatitis. Complications Cerebral oedema (get help if sudden CNS decline), aspiration pneu- monia, hypokalaemia, hypom agnesaemia, hypophosphataemia, thromboembolism. Prevention Talk to the patient: evaluate compliance and educate about triggers. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 883322 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE  Management plan for diabetic ketoacidosis 833 ABC approach, 2 large-bore cannulae: Start fl uid: 1L 0.9% saline over 1h (if systolic BP <90mmHg then give 500mL bolus over 15mins and reassess—if systolic BP still <90mmHg then seek senior review and give further 500mL bolus; if BP remains <90mmHg then involve ICU) Tests: Venous blood gas for pH, bicarbonate; bedside and lab glucose and ketones; U&ES, FBC, CRP; CXR, ECG Insulin: Add 50 units human soluble insulin to 50mL 0.9% saline. Infuse con- tinuously at 0.1 unit/kg/h. Continue patient’s regular long-acting insulin at usual doses and times; consider initiating long-acting insulin in newly diagnosed T1DM. Aim for a fall in blood ketones of 0.5mmol/L/h, or a rise in venous bicarbo- nate of 3mmol/L/h with a fall in glucose of 3mmol/L/h. If not achieving this, increase insulin infusion by 1 unit/h until target rates achieved Check capillary blood glucose and ketones hourly Check VBG (pH, HCO3Ω, K+) at 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, and 24h (or more frequent)
