ovagal attacks, sick sinus syndrome, drugs (-blockers, digoxin, amiodarone), hypo- thyroidism, hypothermia, intracranial pressure, cholestasis. See p122. AF (ECG p125) Common causes: IHD, thyrotoxicosis, hypertension, obesity, heart fail- ure, alcohol. See p130. Heart block (HB) (See fi g 3.5.) Disrupted passage of electrical impulse through the AV node. 1st-degree HB: The PR interval is prolonged and unchanging; no missed beats. 2nd-degree HB: Mobitz I: The PR interval becomes longer and longer until a QRS is missed, the pattern then resets. This is Wenckebach phenomenon. 2nd-degree HB: Mobitz II: QRSs are regularly missed. eg P - QRS - P - - P - QRS - P - - this would be Mobitz II with 2:1 block (2P:1QRS). This is a dangerous rhythm as it may progress to complete heart block. 1st- and 2nd-degree HB may be caused by: normal variant, athletes, sick sinus syn- drome, IHD (esp inferior MI), acute myocarditis, drugs (digoxin, -blockers). 3rd-degree HB: Complete heart block: No impulses are passed from atria to ventri- cles so P waves and QRSS appear independently of each other. As tissue distal to the AVN paces slowly, the patient becomes very bradycardic, and may develop haemo- dynamic compromise. Urgent treatment is required.
