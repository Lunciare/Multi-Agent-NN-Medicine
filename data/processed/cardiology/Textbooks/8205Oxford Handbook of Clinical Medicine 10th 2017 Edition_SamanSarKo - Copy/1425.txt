unomide—teratogenicity ( and ), oral ulcers, BP, hepatotoxicity. • Hydroxy- chloroquine—can cause retinopathy; pre treatment and annual eye screen required. Biological agents and NICE guidance Initiated by specialists, for patients with active disease despite adequate trial of at least 2 DMARDS. Pre treatment screening for TB, hepatitis B/C, HIV essential. 1 TNF inhibitors: Eg infl iximab (p265), etanercept, adalimumab, are approved by NICE as 1st-line agents. Where methotrexate is contraindicated, can be used as monotherapy. Clinical response can be striking, with improved function and health outcomes, although response may be inadequate/unsustained.25 2 B-cell depletion: Eg rituximab, used in combination with methotrexate and ap- proved by NICE for severe active RA where DMARDS and a TNF blocker have failed.26 3 IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition: Eg tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor blocker), approved by NICE in combination with methotrexate where TNF blocker has failed (or is contraindi- cated).27 Monitor for hypercholesterolaemia. 4 Inhibition of T-cell co-stimulation: Eg abatacept—licensed for active RA where patients have not responded to DMARDS or TNF blocker.28 Side eff ects of biological agents Serious infection, reactivation of TB ( screen and consider prophylaxis) and hepatitis B; worsening heart failure; hypersensitiv- ity; injection-site reactions and blood disorders.
