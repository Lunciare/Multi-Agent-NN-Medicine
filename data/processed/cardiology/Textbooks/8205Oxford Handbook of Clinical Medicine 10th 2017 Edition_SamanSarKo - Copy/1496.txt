or spinal blocks (contraindication: anticoagula- tion, local infection) using long-acting local anaesthetics such as bupivacaine may be indicated. See table 13.4 for doses and toxicity eff ects. Drugs complicating anaesthesia Inform anaesthetist. See p566 for lists of spe- cifi c drugs, and actions to take. Malignant hyperpyrexia This is a rare complication, precipitated by any volatile agent, eg halothane, or suxamethonium. It exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance. There is a rapid rise in temperature (>1°C every 30min); masseter spasm may be an early sign. Complications include hypoxaemia, hypercarbia, hyperkalaemia, meta- bolic acidosis, and arrhythmias. Get expert help immediately. Prompt treatment with dantrolene3 (skeletal muscle relaxant), active cooling and ITU care can reduce mortality signifi cantly. 3 Give 1mg/kg every 5min IV—up to 10mg/kg in total (OHCS p628). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 557722 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Principles and practical conduct of anaesthesia 573 Hypnosis Analgesia Muscle relaxation Fig 13.4 Principles of anaesthesia. The conduct of anaesthesia (fi g 13.4) typically involves: • Induction: Either intravenous (eg propofol 1.5–2.5mg/kg IV at a rate of 20–40mg every 10s; thiopental is an alternative) or, if airway obstruction or diffi cult IV ac- cess, gaseous (eg sevofl urane or nitrous oxide, mixed in O2). • Airway control: Either using
