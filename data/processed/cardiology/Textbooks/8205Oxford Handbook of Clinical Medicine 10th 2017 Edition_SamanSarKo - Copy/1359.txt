used in breast cancer treatment. • Antitumour antibiotics: Interrupt DNA function, eg dactinomycin, doxorubicin, mitomycin, bleomycin. • Monoclonal antibodies: Antibodies to a specifi c tumour antigen can slow tumour growth by enhancing host immunity, or be conjugated with chemotherapy/radioac- tive isotopes to allow targeted treatment. Expect more of these in future. • Topoisomerase inhibitors: Interrupt regulation of DNA winding, eg etoposide. • Vinca alkaloids and taxanes: ‘Spindle poisons’ which target mechanisms of cell division, eg vincristine, vinblastine, docetaxel. Side-eff ects Due to cytotoxic eff ects on non-cancer cells. Greatest eff ect seen on dividing cells, ie gut, hair, bone marrow, gametes (see BOX ‘Fertility and cancer’, p525). • Vomiting: Prophylaxis given with most cytotoxic regimens (see p251). • Alopecia: May profoundly impact quality of life. Consider ‘cold-cap’, wig services. • Neutropenia: Most commonly seen 7–14d after chemotherapy. Neutropenic sep- sis is life-threatening and needs urgent assessment and empirical treatment (p352). Extravasation of chemotherapy Extravasation8 = inadvertent infi ltration of a drug into subcutaneous/subdermal tissue. Presentation: Tingling, burning, pain, redness, swelling, no ‘fl ashback’/re- sistance from cannula. Management: Stop and disconnect infusion. Aspirate any residual drug before cannula removed. Follow local policies (ask for the ‘extravasa- tion kit’). Follow any drug-specifi
