the other direction is called ‘antidromic’ and results in broad QRS complexes. E. Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia: (AVNRT) Circuits form within the AVN, causing narrow complex tachycardias. This is very common. F. Junctional tachycardia: Cells in the AVN become the pacemaker, giving nar- row QRS complexes as impulses reach the ventricles through the normal routes; P waves may be inverted and late. G. Bundle branch block: Any of the above conditions can result in broad complex tachycardias if there is bundle branch block (see p100). H. Ventricular tachycardia: (VT) This can result from circuits, similar to atrial fl utter, or from focuses of rapidly-fi ring cells. The QRS is broad. When a circuit is in action and its plane rotates, the ECG shows broad complex tachycardia with regularly increasing and decreasing amplitudes; this is called torsades de pointes. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 112277 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 128 Broad complex tachycardia Defi nition ECG shows rate of >100 and QRS complexes >120ms.
