Proteinuria usually <1g. Slow, indolent disease: 20– 50% progress to renal failure over 30yr. Worse prognosis in , BP, creatinine, proteinuria. Diagnosis: Renal biopsy: IgA deposition in mesangium. Treatment: ACE-i/ARB reduce proteinuria and protect renal function. Corticosteroids and fi sh oil if persistent proteinuria >1g despite 3–6 months of ACE-i/ARB and GFR >50. Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP) Small vessel vasculitis and systemic variant of IgA nephropathy with IgA deposition in skin/joints/gut in addition to kidney. Presentation: Purpuric rash on extensor sur- faces (typically on the legs, p702), fl itting polyarthritis, abdominal pain (GI bleeding), and nephritis. Diagnosis: Usually clinical. Confi rmed with positive IF for IgA and C3 in skin. Renal biopsy is identical to IgA nephropathy. Treatment: Renal disease is man- aged as IgA nephropathy. Steroids may be used for gut involvement. Post-streptococcal GN Occurs after a throat (~ 2 weeks) or skin (~3–6 weeks) infection. Streptococcal antigen deposits in the glomerulus leading to immune complex formation and infl
