are smaller than size #0, hence rising numbers with a -0 suffi x correspond to progressively fi ner grades of suture up to 11–0 (fi ne ophthalmic monofi laments). 3–0 or 4–0 are the best sizes for skin closure. Timing of suture re- moval depends on site and the general health of the patient. Face and neck sutures may be removed after 5d (earlier in children), scalp and back of neck after 5d, ab- dominal incisions and proximal limbs (including clips) after ~10d, distal extremities after 14d. In patients with poor wound healing, eg steroids, malignancy, infection, cachexia (p35), the elderly, or smokers, sutures may need ~14d.
