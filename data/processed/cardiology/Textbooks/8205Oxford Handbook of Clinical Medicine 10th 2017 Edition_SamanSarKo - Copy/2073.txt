Oxygen saturation and ABG if SaO2 <92% or severe pneumonia. • FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP. • Blood cultures (if CURB-65 ≥2). • Sputum cultures (if CURB-65 ≥3 or if CURB-65 =2 and not had antibiotics yet). • Urine pneumococcal antigen (if CURB-65 ≥2); Legionella antigen (if CURB-65 ≥3 or if clinical suspicion). • Consider need for viral throat swabs and mycoplasma PCR/serology. • Pleural fl uid may be aspirated for culture (if CURB-65 ≥2). • Consider bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage if the patient is immunocom- promised or on ICU. Severity: Calculate the core adverse features ‘CURB-65’ score: •Confusion (abbrevi- ated mental test ≤8). •Urea >7mmol/L. •Respiratory rate ≥30/min. •BP <90/60mmHg. •Age ≥65. Score: 0–1: home treatment if possible; ≥2: hospital therapy; ≥3: indicates severe pneumonia and should consider ICU referral. Other features increasing the risk of death are: coexisting disease; bilateral/multi- lobar involvement; PaO2 <8kPa or SaO2 <92%. Treatment: See antibiotic guidance (table 4.2 on p167). Most patients who require IV antibiotics can safely be switched to PO therapy by day 3. Complications (Of infection or treatment.) Pleural eff usion, empyema, lung abscess, respiratory failure, septicaemia, pericarditis, myocarditis, cholestatic jaundice, acute kidney injury. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 881166 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE  Management
