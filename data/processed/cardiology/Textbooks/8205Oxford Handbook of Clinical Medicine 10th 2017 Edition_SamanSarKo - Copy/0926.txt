resulting in long periods of marrow suppression with neutropenia + platelets . The main drugs used include daunorubicin and cyt arabine, with ~5 cycles given in 1-week blocks to get a remission (RAS muta- tions occur in ~20% of patients with AML and enhance sensitivity to cytarabine). • Bone marrow transplant (BMT): Pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells are col- lected from the marrow. Allogeneic transplants from HLA-matched donors (held on international databases) are indicated in refractory or relapsing disease. The idea is to destroy leuka emic cells and the immune system by, eg cyclophospha- mide + total body irradiation, then repopulate the marrow with donor cells in- fused IV. Ciclosporin ± methotrexate are used to reduce the eff ect of the new marrow attacking the patient’s body (GVHD). • Complications: GVHD (may help explain the curative eff ect of BMT); opportunis- tic infections; relapse of leukaemia; infertility. • Prognosis: Lower relapse rates ~60% long-term survivors, but signifi cant mor- tality of ~10%. Autologous BMT (where stem cells are taken from the patient themselves) is used in intermediate prognosis disease, although some studies suggest better survival rates with intensive chemotherapy regimens. • Autologous mobilized peripheral blood stem cell transplantation may off er
