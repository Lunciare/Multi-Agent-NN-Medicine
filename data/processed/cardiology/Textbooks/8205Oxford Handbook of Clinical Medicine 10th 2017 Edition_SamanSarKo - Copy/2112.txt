Continuing treatment • Glucose IV may be needed if hypoglycaemic. • Give IV fl uids as guided by clinical state and to correct U&E imbalance. • Continue hydrocortisone, eg 100mg/8h IV or IM. • Change to oral steroids after 72h if patient’s condition good. • Fludrocortisone may well be needed if the cause is adrenal disease: ask an expert. • Search for (and vigorously treat) the underlying cause.
