signifi cant perfusion defects). Fig 16.30 99Tc perfusion study showing perfusion defect in the left ventricle anterior and lateral walls at stress which is partially reversible (diff erence between stress and rest im- ages). This study is good for small vessel disease such as in diabetes; CT and coronary angi- ography do not show small vessel disease well.

US is the 1st-line imaging choice for abnormal LFTS, jaundice, hepatomeg- aly, renal dysfunction, and abdominal masses. Ensure the patient is ‘nil by mouth’ for 4 hours beforehand (aids gallbladder fi lling). Pelvic US needs a full bladder (con- sider clamping the catheter if appropriate). US may also guide diagnostic biopsy and therapeutic aspiration of cysts or collections. CT plays an important role in the investigation of acute abdominal pain (see pp730–3). It is unparalleled in the detection of free gas and intra-abdominal collections, and allows good visualization of the colon and retroperitoneal areas. Oral or IV contrast medium enhances defi nition (p730). The big
