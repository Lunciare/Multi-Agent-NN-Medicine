Consider cognitive behavioural therapy (OHCS p390), hypnosis, and tricyclics, eg amitriptyline 10–20mg at night (SE: drowsiness, dry mouth); explain that this is at a low dose for visceral pain (ie you are not prescribing the higher licensed dose for depression). 20 Bacterial overgrowth proximal to the colon causes diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and vitamin malabsorp- tion.
