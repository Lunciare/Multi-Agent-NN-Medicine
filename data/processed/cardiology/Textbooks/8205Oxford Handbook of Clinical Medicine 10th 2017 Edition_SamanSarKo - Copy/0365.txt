Inpatient management may include: • Minimal exertion; Na+ & fl uid restriction (1.5L/24h PO). • Metolazone (as above) and IV furosemide (p800). • Opiates and IV nitrates may relieve symptoms (p800). • Weigh daily. Do frequent U&E (beware K+). • Give DVT prophylaxis: heparin + TED stockings (p578). In extremis: Try IV inotropes (p802; it may be diffi cult to wean patients off them). Consider: Cardiac resynchronization (p132), LV assist device (BOX ‘Pulseless pa- tients’), or transplantation. Palliative care Treat/prevent comorbidities (eg ’fl u vaccination). Good nutrition (allow alcohol!). Involve GP: continuity of care and discussion of prognosis is much apprec i ated. 42 Dyspnoea, pain (from liver capsule stretching), nausea, constipation, and mood all need tackling. 43 Opiates improve pain and dyspnoea.

An internalized pump forces blood through tubing from the left ventricle to the aorta. To power the pump, the patient attaches the device to the mains electricity, and uses batteries when out and about. Patients with continuous (rather than pulsatile)
