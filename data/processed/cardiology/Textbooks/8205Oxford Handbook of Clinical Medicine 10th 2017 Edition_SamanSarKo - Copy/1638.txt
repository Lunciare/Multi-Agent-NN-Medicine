It has the lowest recurrence rate. •Sclerosants. (1st- or 2nd-degree.) 2mL of 5% phenol in oil is injected into the pile above the den- tate line, inducing fi brotic reaction. Recurrence higher (SE: impotence; prostatitis). •Infra-red coagulation. Applied to localized areas of piles, it works by coagulating vessels and tethering mucosa to subcutaneous tissue. It is as successful as banding and may be less painful. •Bipolar diathermy and direct current electrotherapy. Causes coagulation and fi brosis after local application of heat. Success rates are simi- lar to those of infrared coagulation, and complication rates are low. 3 Surgery: •Excisional haemor rhoid ectomy is the most eff ective treatment (excision of piles ± ligation of vascular pedicles, as day-case surgery, needing ~2wks off work). Scalpel, electrocautery, or laser may be used. •Stapled haemorrhoidopexy (procedure for prolapsing haemorrhoids) may result in less pain, a shorter hospital stay, and quick- er return to normal activity than conventional surgery. It is used when there is a large internal component, but has a higher recurrence and prolapse rate than excisional. Surgical complications include constipation; infection; stricture; bleeding. Prolapsed, thrombosed piles Analgesia, ice packs, and stool softeners. Pain usu- ally resolves in 2–3wks. Some advocate early
