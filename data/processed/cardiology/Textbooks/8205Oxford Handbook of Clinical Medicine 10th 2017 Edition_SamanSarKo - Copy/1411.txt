staphy- lococcal but also Proteus, E. coli, S. typhi, and TB—there are often no systemic signs). Investigations Arrange relevant tests if you suspect a specifi c cause, or if red fl ag symptoms: FBC, ESR, and CRP (myeloma, infection, tumour), U&E, ALP (Paget’s), serum/urine electrophoresis (myeloma), PSA. X-rays—imaging may not always be necessary but can exclude bony abnormalities and fractures. Correlation be- tween radiographic abnormalities and clinical features can be poor. MRI is the image of choice and can detect disc prolapse, cord compression (fi g 12.7), can- cer, infection, or infl ammation (eg sacroiliitis). Management Urgent neurosurgical referral if any neurological defi cit (see BOX). Keep the diagnosis under review. For non-specifi c back pain, focus on education and self-management. Advise patients to continue normal activites and be ac- tive. Regular paracetamol ± NSAIDS ± codeine. Consider low-dose amitriptyline/du- loxetine if these fail (not SSRIS for pain). Off er physiotherapy, acupuncture, or an exercise programme if not improving.4 Address psychosocial issues, which may predispose to developing chronic pain and disability (see p559). Referral to pain clinic or surgical options for patients with intractable symptoms. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 554422 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolotamuehR Neurosurgical emergencies 543 Acute cauda equina compression Alternating or bilateral
