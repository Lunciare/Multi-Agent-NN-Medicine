hypertension, hypokalaemia, or alkalosis in someone not on diuret- ics. Sodium tends to be mildly raised or normal. Symptoms: Often asymptomatic or signs of hypokalaemia (p674): weakness (even quadriparesis), cramps, paraesthesiae, polyuria, polydipsia. BP but not always. Causes: ~ ⅔ due to a solitary aldosterone-producing adenoma (linked to mutations in K+ channels)5—Conn’s syndrome. ~ ⅓ due to bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia. Rare causes: adrenal carcinoma; or glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism (GRA)— the ACTH regulatory element of the 11-hydroxylase gene fuses to the aldosterone synthase gene, aldosterone production, & bringing it under the control of ACTH. Tests: U&E, renin and aldosterone, and adrenal vein sampling. Do not rely on a low K+, as >20% are normokalaemic. For GRA (suspect if there is a family history of early hypertension), genetic testing is available. Treatment: •Conn’s: laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Spironolactone (25–100mg/24h PO) for 4wks pre-op controls BP and K+. •Hyperplasia: treated medically: spironolactone or amiloride. •GRA: dexametha- sone 1mg/24h PO for 4wks, normalizes biochemistry but not always BP. If BP is still , use spironolactone as an alternative. •Adrenal carcinoma: surgery ± post-operative adrenolytic therapy with mitotane—prognosis is poor. Secondary hyperaldosteronism Due to a high renin from renal perfusion, eg in renal artery stenosis, accelerated hypertension, diuretics,
