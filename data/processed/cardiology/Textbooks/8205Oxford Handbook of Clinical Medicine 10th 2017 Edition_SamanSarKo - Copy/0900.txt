during trauma, dentistry, surgery? • Is the pattern of bleeding indicative of vascular, platelet, or coagulation prob- lems (p344)? Are old venepuncture or cannula sites bleeding (DIC, p352)? Look for associated conditions (eg with DIC). • Is a clotting screen abnormal (table 8.3)? Check FBC, platelets, PT, APTT, and thrombin time. Consider D-dimers, bleeding time, and a factor VIII assay. If both PT and APTT are very raised, with low platelets and D-dimers, consider DIC (p352). 3 In cases of bleeding disorders, what is the mechanism? Investigate with FBC, fi lm, and coagulation screen (citrate tube; false results if under-fi lled): • Prothrombin time (PT): Thromboplastin is added to test the extrinsic system. PT is expressed as a ratio compared to control (international normalized ratio (INR), normal range = 0.9–1.2). It tests for abnormalities in factors I, II, V, VII, X. Prolonged by: warfarin, vitamin K defi ciency, liver disease, DIC. • Activated partial thrombop lastin time (APTT): Kaolin is added to test the intrinsic system. Tests for abnormalities in factor I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII. Normal range 35–45s. Prolonged by: heparin treatment, haemophilia, DIC, liver disease. • Thrombin time: Thrombin is added to plasma to convert
