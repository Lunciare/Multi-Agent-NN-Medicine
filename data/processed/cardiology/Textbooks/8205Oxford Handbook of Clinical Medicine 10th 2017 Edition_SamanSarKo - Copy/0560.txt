on TSH. Once normal, check TSH yearly. Enzyme inducers (p689) metabolism of levothyroxine. • Elderly or ischaemic heart disease: Start with 25mcg/24h; dose by 25mcg/4wks according to TSH (cautiously, as levothyroxine may precipitate angina or MI). • If diagnosis is in question and T4 already given: Stop T4; recheck TSH in 6 weeks. Amiodarone An iodine-rich drug structurally like T4 ; 2% of users will get signifi - cant thyroid problems from it. Hypothyroidism can be caused by toxicity from io- dine excess (T4 release is inhibited). Thyrotoxicosis may be caused by a destructive thyroiditis causing hormone release. Here, radioiodine uptake can be undetectable and if this is the case, glucocorticoids may help. Get expert help. Thyroidectomy may be needed if amiodarone cannot be discontinued. T ½ of amiodarone ≈80d, so problems persist after withdrawal. If on amiodarone, check TFTS 6-monthly. Myxoedema coma The ultimate hypothyroid state before death. See p834. 3 Treat the patient not the blood level! No exact cut-off in TSH can be given partly because risk of death from heart disease mirrors TSH even when in the normal range in women. Risk ≈ 1.4 if TSH 1.5–2.4 vs 1.7 if TSH 2.5–3.5. If TSH >3.65 and
