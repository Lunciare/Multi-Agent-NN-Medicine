This is the reverse of osteoporosis in which mineralization is unchanged, but there is overall bone loss. Rickets is the result if this process occurs during the period of bone growth; osteomalacia is the result if it occurs after fusion of the epiphyses. Signs and symptoms Rickets: Growth retardation, hypotonia, apathy in infants. Once walking: knock- kneed, bow-legged, and deformities of the metaphyseal–epiphyseal junction (eg the rachitic rosary). Features of Ca2+—often mild (p678). Children with rickets are ill. Osteomalacia: Bone pain and tenderness; fractures (esp.
