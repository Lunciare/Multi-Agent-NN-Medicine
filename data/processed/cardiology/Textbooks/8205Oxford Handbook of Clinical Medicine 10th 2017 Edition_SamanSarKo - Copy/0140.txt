for low-pitched sounds (eg mitral stenosis) and should be applied gently. The diaphragm fi lters out low pitches, making higher-pitched murmurs easier to detect (eg aortic regurgita- tion). NB: a bell applied tightly to the skin becomes a diaphragm. Consider any murmur in terms of character, timing, loudness, area where loudest, radiation, and accentuating manoeuvres. When in doubt, rely on echocardiography rather than disputed sounds. (But still enjoy trying to fi gure out the clinical conundrum!) Character and timing (See fi g 2.14.) • An ejection-systolic murmur (ESM, crescendo–decrescendo) usually originates from the outfl ow tract and waxes and wanes with the intraventricular pressures. ESMS may be innocent and are common in children and high-output states (eg tachycardia, pregnancy). Organic causes include aortic stenosis and sclerosis, pul- monary stenosis, and H(O)CM. • A pansystolic murmur (PSM) is of uniform intensity and merges with S2. It is usu- ally organic and occurs in mitral or tricuspid regurgitation (S1 may also be soft in these), or a ventricular septal defect (p156). Mitral valve prolapse may produce a late systolic murmur ± midsystolic click. • Early diastolic murmurs (EDMs) are high pitched and easily missed: listen for the ‘absence of silence’ in early
