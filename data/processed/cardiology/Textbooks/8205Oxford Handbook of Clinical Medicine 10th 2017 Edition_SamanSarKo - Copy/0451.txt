dilatation of the airways throughout the right upper lobe, subtle similar changes throughout the rest of the lung (particulalry periphery of the left upper zone). The fi ne background reticular pattern in the lungs suggests that there may also be some interstitial lung disease present.

All UK babies are screened at birth. Caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7 (>1500 mutations have been identifi ed). This is a ClΩ channel, and the defect leads to a combination of defective chloride secretion and increased sodium absorption across airway epithelium. The changes in the com- position of airway surface liquid predispose the lung to chronic pulmonary infections and bronchiectasis. See OHCS (‘Paediatrics’, p162) for more detail. Clinical features Neonate: Failure to thrive; meconium ileus; rectal prolapse. Children and young adults: Respiratory: cough; wheeze; recurrent infections; bronchiectasis; pneumothorax; haemoptysis; respiratory failure; cor pulmonale. Gastrointestinal: pancreatic insuffi ciency (diabetes mellitus, steatorrhoea); distal intestinal
