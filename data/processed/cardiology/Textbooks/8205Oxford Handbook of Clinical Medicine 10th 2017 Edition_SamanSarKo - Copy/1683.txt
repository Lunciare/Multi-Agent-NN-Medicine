women with void- ing dysfunction show that it is common. The cause may be muscular or neuro- logical dysfunction or fi brosis. Diagnosis: Video-urodynamics, with simultaneous pressure-fl ow measurement, and visualization of the bladder neck during voiding. Treatment: Watchful waiting; -blockers (p642); surgery. Urethral stricture This may follow trauma or infection (eg gonorrhoea)—and frequently leads to voiding symptoms, UTI, or retention. Malignancy is a rare cause. Imaging: Retrograde urethrogram or antegrade cystourethrogram if the patient has an existing suprapubic catheter. Internal urethrotomy involves incising the stricture transurethrally using endoscopic equipment—to release scar tissue. Stents incorporate themselves into the wall of the urethra and keep the lumen open. They work best for short strictures in the bulbar urethra (anterior urethral anatomy, from proximal to distal: prostatic urethraposterior or membranous urethrabulbar urethrapenile or pendulous urethrafossa navicularismeatus). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 664499 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 650 Lumps in the groin and scrotum Testicular lump = cancer until proved otherwise. Acute, tender enlargement of testis = torsion (p652) until proved otherwise.
