to percussion. • Enlarges towards the RIF. • Moves down on inspiration. • You may feel a medial notch. • ‘You can’t get above it’ (ie the top margin disappears under the ribs). Tests: Image the spleen with abdominal USS or CT. Hunt for the cause of en- largement: look for lymphadenopathy and liver disease, eg: FBC, ESR, LFT ± liver, marrow, or lymph node biopsy. Complications: Symptoms of anaemia, infection, or bleeding can occur as a re- sult of hypersplenism: cells become trapped in the spleen’s reticuloendothelial system causing pancytopenia. Splenectomy may be required if severe. Splenectomy: Main indications: splenic trauma, hypersplenism, autoimmune haemolysis: in ITP (p345), warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (p338), or congenital haemolytic anaemias. Mobilize early post-splenectomy as transient platelets predisposes to thrombi. A characteristic blood fi lm is seen following splenectomy, with Howell–Jolly bodies, Pappenheimer bodies, and target cells (see p328). The main problem post-splenectomy is lifelong increased risk from infec- tion. The spleen contains macrophages which fi lter and phagocytose bacteria. Post-splenectomy infection is caused most commonly by encapsulated organ- isms: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus infl uenzae, and Neisseria men- ingitidis. Reduce this risk by giving: 1 Immunizations: • Pneumococcal vaccine (p167), at least 2 weeks
