red (reactive hyperaemia). It may be idiopathic (Raynaud’s disease—prevalence: 3–20%; : >1:1) or have an underlying cause (Raynaud’s phenomenon; fi g 15.16). Tests: Exclude an underlying cause (see BOX ‘Conditions in which Raynaud’s phenomenon may be exhibited’). : Keep warm (eg hand warmers); stop smoking.4 Nifedipine 5–20mg/8h PO helps, as may evening prim- rose oil, sildenafi l, and epoprostenol (for severe attacks/digital gangrene). Relapse is common. Chemical or surgical (lumbar or digital) sympathectomy may help in those with severe disease.

Coronary spasm can be induced by ergonovine, acetylcholine, and methacholine (the former is used diagnostically).5 These cause vasodilation by endothelium-derived nitric oxide when vascular endothelium is functioning normally, whereas they cause vasocon- striction if the endothelium is damaged. In the light of these facts, patients with coronary spasm are thought to have a disturbance in endothelial function as well as local hyperreactivity of the coronary arteries. If full anti-anginal therapy does not reduce symptoms, stenting or intrac oronary radiation (20Gy brachytherapy)
