traditional neurological examination relies on the musculoskeletal system being intact. Ruptured tendons and fractures may mimic focal neurological lesions (espe- cially in patients who can’t give a clear history). Table 10.2 Assessment of peripheral nerve function in the lower limb Nerve root Muscle Test by asking the patient to: Femoral nerve L1, 2, 3 Iliopsoas (also supplied via Flex hip against resistance with knee L1, 2, & 3 spinal nerves) fl exed and lower leg supported: patient lies on back L2, 3, 4 Quadriceps femoris Extend at knee against resista nce. Start with knee fl exed Obturator nerve L2, 3, 4 Hip adductors Adduct leg against resistance Inferior gluteal nerve L5, S1, S2 Gluteus maximus Hip extension (‘bury heel into the couch’)—with knee in extension Superior gluteal nerve L4, 5, S1 Gluteus medius and minimus Abduction and internal hip rotation with leg fl exed at hip and knee Sciatic and common peroneal* nerves; sciatic and tibial** nerves *L4, 5 Tibialis anterior Dorsifl ex ankle *L5, S1 Extensor digitorum longus Dorsifl ex toes against resistance *L5, S1 Extensor hallucis longus Dorsifl ex hallux against resistance *L5, S1 Peroneus longus and brevis Evert foot against resistance *L5, S1 Extensor digitorum brevis Dorsifl
