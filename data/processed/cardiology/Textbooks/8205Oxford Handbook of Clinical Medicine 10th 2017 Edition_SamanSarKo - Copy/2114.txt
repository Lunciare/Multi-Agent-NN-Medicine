Principle is combined - and -adrenoreceptor blockade, but  must be started fi rst, as unopposed -blockade can worsen hypertension. • Start with short-acting, IV -blocker, eg phentolamine 2–5mg IV. Repeat to main- tain safe BP. • When BP controlled, give long-acting -blocker, eg phenoxybenzamine 10mg/24h PO (increase by 10mg/d as needed, up to 30mg/12h PO); SE: postural hypotension; dizziness; tachycardia; nasal congestion; miosis; idiosyncratic marked BP drop after 1st dose. The idea is to  the dose until BP is controlled and there is no signifi cant postural hypotension. Alternative 1-selective blockers, eg doxazosin, are preferred in some centres, particularly if surgery is not an option, eg metastatic tumour. • A 1-blocker may also be given at this stage to control any tachycardia or myocar- dial ischaemia/dysrhythmias (p114). • Surgery is usually done electively after 4–6wks to allow full -blockade and volume expansion. When admitted for surgery the phenoxybenzamine dose is increased until signifi cant postural hypotension occurs. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 883377 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 838 Acute poisoning—general measures Diagnosis Mainly from the history.
