NB: AST may be , p278, p281. Chronic viral hepatitis: ALT; HBV & C are a leading cause worldwide. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH): Occurs mainly in young and middle-aged females. Fatty infi ltration of the liver: (See p285.) Probably the chief cause of mildly raised LFTS in the general population and may be recognized on ultrasound.

Drug-induced hepatitis: As no specifi c serology identifi es most culprits, a good history is vital. Paracetamol overdose causes most acute liver failure in the UK. Cholestasis predominant liver injury ALP and GGT are ; AST and ALT mildly. Management For each specifi c diagnosis, manage accordingly. If asymptomatic and other tests are Ωve, try lifestyle modifi cation. Help reduce weight and alcohol use (p280 & OHCS p512); control DM & dyslipidaemia; stop hepatotoxic drugs.
