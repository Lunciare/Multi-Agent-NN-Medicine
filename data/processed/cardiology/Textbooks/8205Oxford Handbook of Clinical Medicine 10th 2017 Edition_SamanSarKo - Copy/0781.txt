the underlying disorder which will stop acid production. Where the eff ect of treatment may be delayed, acidosis will persist and renal replace- ment may be indicated (p306). Medical management of acidosis is controversial. Giving sodium bicarbonate will generate CO2. Adequate ventilation is therefore needed to prevent respiratory acido- sis worsening the clinical picture. Sodium bicarbonate also represents a sodium and a volume load which can precipitate fl uid overload in the vulnerable patient. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 330000 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR Hyperkalaemia 301 Fig 7.4 ECG showing severe hyperkalaemia; note broadening of QRS complexes. ECG changes: In order: tall ‘tented’ T waves; increased PR interval; small or absent P wave; widened QRS complex (fi g 7.4); ‘sine wave’ pattern; asystole.

This is cardioprotective (for 30–60min) but does not treat K+ level. 2 Intravenous insulin (10u soluble insulin) in 25g glucose (50mL of 50% or
