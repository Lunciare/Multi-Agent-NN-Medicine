Ask your patient to repeat the number. Make sure that failure is not from misunderstanding. Tuning fork tests Rinne: Hold a vibrating tuning fork (512Hz or 256Hz) on the mas- toid to test bone conduction (BC). When the sound is no longer audible move it in front of the ear with the prongs perpendicular to the auditory canal to test air con- duction (AC). If there is no conductive defi cit (ie in normal hearing or sensorineural hearing loss), AC is better than BC and the patient will be able to hear the note again. This is a ‘Rinne positive’ result. If BC is better than AC (Rinne negative), this indicates conductive deafness >20dB. A false-negative may occur in severe sensorineural hear- ing loss (SNHL) as the contralateral cochlea picks up the sound by bone conduction. Weber: With the vibrating tuning fork on the vertex or forehead, ask the patient which ear the sound is louder in. Sound localizes to the aff ected ear with conductive loss (>10dB loss), to the contralateral ear in SNHL, and to the midline if both ears are normal (or if bilateral SNHL). Conductive deafness Causes: Wax (remove, eg by syringing with warm water af-
