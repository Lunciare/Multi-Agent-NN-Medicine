bundle hemiblock, manifest as an axis deviation, eg left axis deviation in the case of left anterior hemiblock. Trifascicular block: Bifascicular block plus 1st-degree HB. May need pacing (p132). Suspect left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) if the R wave in V6 is >25mm or the sum of the S wave in V1 and the R wave in V6 is >35mm (see fi g 3.41). Suspect right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) if dominant R wave in V1, T wave inver- sion in V1–V3 or V4, deep S wave in V6, right axis deviation. Other causes of dominant R wave in V1: RBBB, posterior MI, type A WPW syndrome (p133). Causes of low-voltage QRS complex: (QRS <5mm in all limb leads.) Hypothyroid- ism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), haematocrit (intracardiac blood resistivity is related to haematocrit), changes in chest wall impedance (eg in renal failure & subcutaneous emphysema but not obesity), pulmonary embolism, bundle branch block, carcinoid heart disease, myocarditis, cardiac amyloid, doxorubicin cardiotoxicity, and other heart muscle diseases, pericardial eff usion, pericarditis. 5 See lifeinthefastlane.com for excellent ECG tutorials, cases, and examples. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 110000 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC Fig 3.7 Left bundle branch block: wide QRS with a W pattern in V1 (slight
