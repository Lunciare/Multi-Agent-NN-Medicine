anterolateral (spinothalamic) tracts in the cord and brainstem (p516), whereas joint-position and vibration sense travel in large fi bres in peripheral nerves and the large dorsal columns of the cord. Muscle weakness grading (MRC classifi cation) • Grade 0 No muscle contraction • Grade 3 Active movement against gravity • Grade 1 Flicker of contraction • Grade 4 Active movement against resistance • Grade 2 Some active movement • Grade 5 Normal power (allowing for age) Grade 4 covers a big range: 4Ω, 4, and 4+ denote movement against slight, moder- ate, and stronger resistance; avoid fudging descriptions—‘streng th 4/5 through- out’ suggests a mild quadriparesis or myopathy. It is better to document ‘poor eff ort’ and the maximum grade for each muscle tested. Distribution of weakness tells us more than grade of weakness (grade does help document improvement). 1 Most of the fi bres of the corticospinal (=pyramidal) tract decussate at the medullary pyramids, hence the name and the contralateral nature of symptoms. Extrapyramidal denotes damage to the basal ganglia and presents as parkinsonism (see p468, 494). 2 Whereas with rigidity,  tone is not velocity-dependent but constant throughout passive movement. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 444466 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN From fi ndings
