weight loss, pericarditis, and pleurisy, but initially few joint problems (com- moner in ). •Polymyalgic onset—vague limb girdle aches. •Recurrent soft tissue problems (eg frozen shoulder, carpal tunnel syndrome, de Quervain’s tenosynovitis). Signs Early: (Infl ammation, no joint damage.) Swollen MCP, PIP, wrist, or MTP joints (often symmetrical). Look for tenosynovitis or bursitis. Later: (Joint damage, de- formity.) Ulnar deviation and subluxation of the wrist and fi ngers. Boutonnière and swan-neck deformities of fi ngers (fi g 12.2 on p540) or Z-deformity of thumbs occur. Hand extensor tendons may rupture. Foot changes are similar. Larger joints can be involved. Atlanto-axial joint subluxation may threaten the spinal cord (rare). Extra-articular manifestations Aff ect ~40% of RA patients. Nodules: Elbows, lungs, cardiac, CNS, lymphadenopathy, vasculitis. Lungs: Pleural dis- ease, interstitial fi brosis, bronchiolitis obliterans, organizing pneumonia. Car- diac: IHD, pericarditis, pericardial eff usion; carpal tunnel syndrome; peripheral neuropathy; splenomegaly (seen in 5%; only 1% have Felty’s syndrome: RA + sple- nomegaly + neutropenia, see p698). Eye: Episcleritis, scleritis, scleromalacia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (p560); osteoporosis; amyloidosis is rare (p370).17,18 Investigations Rheumatoid factor (RhF) is positive in ~70% (p553). High titres associated with severe disease, erosions, and extra-articular disease. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) are
