This provides an estimate of systolic pressure. • Infl ate the cuff until 30mmHg above systolic pressure, then place stethoscope over the brachial artery. Defl ate the cuff at 2mmHg/s. • Systolic pressure: appearance of sustained repetitive tapping sounds (Korotkoff I). • Diastolic pressure: usually the disappearance of sounds (Korotkoff V). However, in some individuals (eg pregnant women) sounds are present until the zero point. In this case, the muffl ing of sounds, Korotkoff IV, should be used. State which is used for a given reading.
