is fi rst clinical sign. Later scarring (glomerulosclerosis), nodule formation (Kimmelstiel–Wilson lesions), and fi brosis with progressive loss of renal function. Coexisting BP accelerates the disease course. Diagnosis: Microalbuminuria (‘moderately increased albuminuria’) = A:CR 3–30mg/ mmol (p294, 302). Regression at this level of disease is possible. Not detected on standard dipstick  must send A:CR. Screen annually. Treatment: • Intensive DM control prevents microalbuminuria and reduces risk of progression to macroalbuminuria (‘severely increased albuminuria’) = A:CR >30mg/mmol. HbA1C of 53mmol/mol (7%) reduces the development of all microvascular complications. However, less impact on CVD risk and hard renal outcomes including progression to kidney failure. Consider risk of hypoglycaemia. • BP <130/80. Use ACE-i or ARB for CV and renal protection above BP control. Can pre- vent progression from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria to macroalbuminu- ria in hypertensive DM. (Less clear benefi t in normotensive DM but recommended if A:CR >30mg/mmol.) No head-to-head studies of ACE-i/ARB in DM but equivalence outside DM. If cough with ACE-i switch to ARB. No benefi t to dual therapy and risk of K+. Data on direct renin inhibitors (eg aliskiren) awaited. • Sodium restriction to <2g/day (=<5g sodium chloride/day). • Statins to reduce CV risk (p305). Unclear
