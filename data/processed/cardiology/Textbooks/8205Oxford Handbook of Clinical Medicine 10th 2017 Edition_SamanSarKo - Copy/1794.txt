intrahepatic porto systemic shunt (TIPSS) may be needed. Anticoagulate (lifelong) unless there are varices. Consider liver transplant in fulminant hepatic necrosis or cirrhosis.13 George Budd, 1808–1882 (British physician); Hans Chiari, 1851–1916 (Austrian pathologist) Buerger’s disease (Thromboangiitis obliterans.) Non-atherosclerotic smoking- related infl ammation and thrombosis of veins and middle-sized arteries causing thrombophlebitis and ischaemia (ulcers, gangrene). Cause: Unknown. Stopping smoking is vital. Most patients are men aged 20–45yrs (see BOX ‘Poisoning your boss’). Leo Buerger, 1879–1943 (US physician) Caplan’s syndrome Multiple lung nodules in coal workers with RA, caused by an in- fl ammatory reaction to anthracite (also associated with silica or asbestos exposure). CXR: bilateral perip heral nodules (0.5–5cm).  : TB. Anthony Caplan, 1907–1976 (British physician) Charcot–Marie–Tooth syndrome (Peroneal muscular atrophy.) This inherited neuropathy starts in puberty with weak legs and foot drop + variable loss of sensa- tion and refl exes. The peroneal muscles atrophy, leading to an inverted champagne bottle appearance. Atrophy of hand and arm muscles also occurs. The most common form, CMT1A (PMP22 myelin gene mutation on chr. 17), has AD inheritance. Quality of life is good; total incapacity rare. Hand pain/paraesthesiae may respond to nerve release. Jean-Marie Charcot, 1825–1893; Pierre Marie, 1853–1940 (French neurologists);
