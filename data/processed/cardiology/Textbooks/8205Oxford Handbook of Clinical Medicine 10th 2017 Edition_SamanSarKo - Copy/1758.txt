Serum levels are a poor guide. Toxic symptoms may also be found with over-energetic re- placement. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 667799 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC 680 Urate and the kidney Causes of hyperuricaemia High levels of urate in the blood (hyperuricaemia) may result from increased turnover (15%) or reduced excretion of urate (85%). Either may be drug induced. • Drugs: Cytotoxics, thiazides, loop diuretics, pyrazinamide. • Increased cell turnover: Lymphoma, leukaemia, psoriasis, haemolysis, muscle death (rhabdomyolysis, p319; tumour lysis syndrome, p529). • Reduced excretion: Primary gout (p548), chronic kidney disease, lead nephropathy, hyperparathyroidism, pre-eclampsia (OHCS p48). • Other: Hyperuricaemia may be associated with hypertension and hyperlipidaemia. Urate may be raised in disorders of purine synthesis such as the Lesch–Nyhan syndrome (OHCS p648). Hyperuricaemia and renal failure Severe renal failure from any cause may be associated with hyperuricaemia, and rarely this may give rise to gout. Sometimes the relationship of cause and eff ect is reversed so that it is the hyperuricaemia that causes the renal failure. This can occur following cytotoxic treatment (tumour
