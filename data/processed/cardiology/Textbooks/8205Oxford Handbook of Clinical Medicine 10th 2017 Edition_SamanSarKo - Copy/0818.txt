cause renal failure (if progressive CKD consider missed FSGS). Diagnosis: Light microscopy is normal (hence the name). Electron microscopy shows eff acement of podocyte foot processes. Treatment: Prednisolone 1mg/kg for 4–16 weeks. 75% of adults will respond, >50% relapse. Frequent relapses are managed with  or longer-term immune suppres- sion (cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitors). Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) Commonest glomerulonephritis seen on renal biopsy. Primary (idiopathic) or secondary (HIV, heroin, lithium, lymphoma, any cause of kidney mass/nephrons, kidney scarring due to another glomerulonephritis). All at risk of progressive CKD and kidney failure: proteinuria worsens prognosis. Disease will recur in 30–50% of kidney transplants. Diagnosis: Glomeruli have scarring of certain segments (ie focal sclerosis). May miss early disease if <10 glomeruli in biopsy sample. Treatment: ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all. Corticosteroids only in primary (idiopathic) disease: remission in ~25%, partial remission in up to 50%. Calcineurin inhibitors may be considered second line. Plasma exchange and rituxi- mab have been used for recurrence in transplants. Membranous nephropathy ~25% of adult nephrotic syndrome. Primary (idiopathic) or secondary to: • malignancy: lung, breast, GI, prostate, haematological • infection: hepatitis B/C, Streptococcus, malaria, schistosomiasis • immunological disease: SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Sjögren’s • drugs:
