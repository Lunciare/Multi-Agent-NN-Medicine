NaCl over 2h. Toxicity risk if: K+, Mg2+, or Ca2+. t½ ≈ 36h. If on digoxin, use less energy in cardioversion (start at 5J). If on amiodarone, halve the dose of digoxin. SES: Any arrhythmia (supraventr icular tachycardia with AV block is suggestive), nausea, appetite, yellow vision, confusion, gynaecomastia. If toxicity is suspected, do an ECG (fi g 3.19), digoxin levels, and check K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+. If toxicity is confi rmed, stop digoxin, correct electrolyte imbalances, treat arrhyt hmias, and consider IV DigiFab® (p842). CIS: HCM; WPW syndrome (p133). Fig 3.19 This ECG shows the classic ‘reverse tick’ of digoxin toxicity: downsloping ST wave with rapid upstroke back to isoelec- tric line. The bradycardia is also suggestive of digoxin toxicity. Sodium channel blockers Class I anti-arrhythmics. Procainamide (1a) and lido- caine (1b) can be used to terminate VT. NB QT interval may be prolonged. Flecainide (1c) is useful for AF cardioversion in patients without contraindications, and for ar- rhythmia prophylaxis in patients with WPW or troublesome paroxysmal AF. CIS: Heart failure, IHD, valve disease, and heart block. Amiodarone A class III anti-arrhythmic. Amiodarone prolongs the cardiac action potential, reducing the potential for tachyarrhythmias. Used in both supra-ventric- ular and
