an unreliable sign, mitral murmurs tend to be loudest over the apex, in contrast to the area of greatest intensity from lesions of the aortic (right 2nd intercostal space), pulmonary (left 2nd intercostal space), and tricuspid (lower left sternal edge) valves. Radiation The ESM of aortic stenosis classically radiates to the carotids, in contrast to the PSM of mitral regurgitation, which radiates to the axilla. Accentuating manoeuvres • Movements that bring the relevant part of the heart closer to the stethoscope ac- centuate murmurs (eg leaning forward for aortic regurgitation, left lateral position for mitral stenosis). • Expiration increases blood fl ow to the left side of the heart and therefore accentu- ates left-sided murmurs. Inspiration has the opposite eff ect. • Valsalva manoeuvre (forced expiration against a closed glottis) decreases sys- temic venous return, accentuating mitral valve prolapse and H(O)CM, but softening mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis. Squatting has exactly the opposite eff ect. Exercise accentuates the murmur of mitral stenosis. Non-valvular murmurs A pericardial friction rub may be heard in pericarditis. It is a superfi cial scratching sound, not confi ned to systole or diastole. Continuous murmurs are present throughout the cardiac cycle and may occur with a
