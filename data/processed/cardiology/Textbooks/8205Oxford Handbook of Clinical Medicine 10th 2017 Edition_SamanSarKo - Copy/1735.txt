is not validated for mild renal impairment, and therefore its use for screening general populations is questionable. • Inter-individual variations (and thus confi dence intervals) are wide, although for each individual variations are small so that a decline in eGFR over a number of serum samples is always signifi cant. • Single results may be aff ected by variations in serum creatinine, such as after a protein-rich meal. Cockcroft–Gault equation: This provides an estimate of creatinine clearance. It is an improvement on the MDRD equation because it also takes into account the patient’s weight. However, 10% of creatinine is actively excreted in the tubules, and therefore creatinine clearance overestimates true GFR and underestimates renal impairment. Moreover, the equation assumes ideal body weight and is thus unreliable in the obese or oedematous. Also unreliable in unstable renal function. (140 Ω age) ≈ weight (kg) ≈ [0 . 85 if female] ≈ [1 . 212 if black] Creatinine clearance = 0 . 813 ≈ serum creatinine (μmol/L) Creatinine clearance can also be calculated by measuring the excreted creatinine in a 24h urine collection and comparing it with the serum creatinine concentra- tion. However, the accuracy of collection is vital but often poor,
