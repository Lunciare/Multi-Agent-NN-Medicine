muscle fi bres on histology. • Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy: The commonest (3/1000 male live births). Presents at ~4yrs old with clumsy walking, then diffi - culty in standing, and respiratory failure. Pseudohypertrophy is seen, especially in the calves. Serum creatine kinase  >40-fold. There is no specifi c treatment. Some survive beyond 20yrs. Home ventilation improves prognosis. Genetic counselling is vital. • Becker’s muscular dystrophy: (~0.3/1000  births.) Presents similarly to Duchenne’s but with milder symptoms, at a later age, and with a better prognosis. • Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrop hy: (FSHD, Landouzy–Dejerine.) Almost as common as Duchenne’s. Onset is ~12–14yrs old, with inability to puff out the cheeks and diffi culty raising the arms above the head. Signs: weakness of face (‘ironed out’ expression), shoulders, and upper arms (often asymmetric with deltoids spared), foot-drop, scapular winging (fi g 10.31) , scoliosis, anterior axillary folds, and horizon- tal clavicles. 20% need a wheelchair by 40yrs. Myotonic disorders Cause tonic muscle spasm (myotonia), and demonstrate long chains of central nuclei within muscle fi bres on histology. The commonest is myo- tonic dystrophy which is, in fact, clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with two major forms (DM1 and DM2—see table 10.12), both showing abnormal
