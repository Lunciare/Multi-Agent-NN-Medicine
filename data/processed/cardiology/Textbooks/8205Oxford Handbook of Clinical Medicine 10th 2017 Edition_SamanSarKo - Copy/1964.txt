place using a drain stitch—make a stitch in the skin close to the drain site, tie this fairly loosely with a double knot. Then tie the suture to the drain. It is usually best to be shown this before attempting it for yourself. Dress the drain, and ensure it is well taped down. • Check that the drain is swinging (eff usion) or bubbling (pneumothorax) and ensure the water bottle remains below the level of the patient at all times. If the drain needs to be lifted above the patient, clamp it briefl y. You should never clamp chest drains inserted for pneumothoraces. Clamping for pleural eff usions can con- trol the rate of drainage and prevent expansion pulmonary oedema. • Request a CXR to check the position of the drain. Removal In pneumothorax: Consider when drain is no longer bubbling and CXR shows re-infl ation. Give analgesia beforehand, eg morphine. Smartly withdraw dur- ing expiration or Valsalva. There is no need to clamp the drain beforehand as reinser- tion is unlikely. In effusions: Generally the drain can be removed when drainage is <200mL/24h, but for cirrhotic hydrothoraces the chest drain is treated similarly to the ascitic drain (see p764)
