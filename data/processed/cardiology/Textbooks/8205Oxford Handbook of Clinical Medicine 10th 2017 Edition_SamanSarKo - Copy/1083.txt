every 3rd day for P. malariae (‘quartan’). Most patients have no specifi c fever pattern. Examination: Fever, otherwise unremarkable. If diagnosis is delayed or severe dis- ease then may present with jaundice, confusion, seizures. Diagnosis Immediate blood testing is mandatory in UK: • Microscopy of thick and thin blood smear. Sensitive and specifi c in experienced hands. • Rapid diagnostic test (RDT) detection of parasite antigen. Used for initial screen if expert microscopy is unavailable, eg out-of-hours. Used in addition to (not instead of) blood fi lm. Results should be available within 4h. If malaria is suspected but blood fi lm is nega- tive: repeat at 12–24h and after further 24h. Malaria is unlikely if three expert serial blood fi lms are negative.  dengue, typhoid, hepatitis, meningitis/encephalitis, HIV, viral haemorrhagic fever. Care in pregnancy: thick fi lms can be negative despite parasites in the placenta. Seek expert help. If P. falciparum (or P. knowlesi) estimated % parasitized red cells should be given: • >2% =  chance of severe disease (indication for parenteral treatment see pp418–9). • >10% = severe disease. Other: FBC (anaemia, thrombocytopenia), creatinine and urine output (AKI), clotting (DIC), glucose (hypoglycaemia), ABG/lactate (acidosis), urinalysis (haemoglobinuria). Malaria
