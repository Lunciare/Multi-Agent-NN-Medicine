oid-sparing agents later. Medium/small: immunosuppression (steroids, ± another agent, eg cyclophosphamide if severe, or methotrexate/azathioprine depending on features). Giant cell arteritis (GCA) = temporal arteritis Common in the elderly—consider Takayasu’s if under 55yrs (p712). Associated with PMR in 50%. Symptoms: Headache, temporal artery and scalp tenderness (eg when combing hair), tongue/jaw clau- dication, amaurosis fugax, or sudden unliateral blindness. Extracranial symptoms: malaise, dyspnoea, weight loss, morning stiff ness, and unequal or weak pulses.49 The risk is irreversible bilateral visual loss, which can occur suddenly if not treated—ask an ophthalmologist. Tests: ESR & CRP are , platelets, ALP, Hb. Temporal artery bi- opsy within 14 days of starting steroids, or FDG-PET. Skip lesions occur, so don’t be put off by a negative biopsy (up to 10%). Management: Start prednisolone 60mg/d PO immediately or IV methylprednisolone if evolving visual loss or history of amau- rosis fugax.50 Prognosis: Typically a 2-year course, then complete remission. Reduce prednisolone once symptoms have resolved and ESR; dose if symptoms recur. Main cause of death and morbidity in GCA is long-term steroid treatment so balance risks! Give PPI, bisphosphonate, calcium with colecalciferol, and consider aspirin.6; 51 Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) PAN is a necrotizing vasculitis that causes aneurysms
