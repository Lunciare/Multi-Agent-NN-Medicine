more symptoms of renal failure including: • inability to control volume status, including pulmonary oedema • inability to control blood pressure • serositis • acid–base or electrolyte abnormalities • pruritus • nausea/vomiting/deterioration in nutritional status • cognitive impairment. RRT is a misnomer for dialysis: renal function is not replaced, rather there is provi- sion of just enough clearance to ameliorate the symptoms of kidney failure. GFR at commencement of dialysis is usually ~5–10. When transplantation is awaited or not possible, there are two main options: haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis. Haemodialysis (HD) (fi g 7.6) Blood is Blood Blood passed over a semi-permeable membrane in Blood returned against dialysis fl uid fl owing in the oppo- site direction. Diff usion of solutes occurs down the concentration gradient. A hy- drostatic gradient is used to clear excess Waste Dialysate Fluid fl uid as required (ultrafi ltration). Access is removed in preferentially via an arteriovenous fi stula which provides blood fl ow and longevity. Fig 7.6 Haemodialysis. This should be created prior to need for RRT to avoid the infection risk associated with central venous dialysis catheters. HD is needed 3 times/week or more. Daily HD increases the ‘dose’ and improves outcomes. Home
