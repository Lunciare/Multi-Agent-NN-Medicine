ve principles: 1 By the mouth—give orally whenever possible. 2 By the clock—give at fi xed intervals to off er continuous relief. 3 By the ladder—following the WHO stepwise approach (see fi g 13.5, p575). 4 For the individual—there are no standard doses for opioids, needs vary. 5 Attention to detail—communicate, set times carefully, warn of side-eff ects. The WHO analgesic ladder Increase and decrease the analgesia required according to the ‘steps’ on the ladder17 (fi g 13.5, p575): 1 Non-opioid, eg paracetamol. 2 Opioid for mild to moderate pain, eg codeine. 3 Opioid for moderate to severe pain, eg morphine, diamorphine, oxycodone. • Persisting/increasing pain and side-eff ects inform the decision to step up and step down. Take one step at a time to achieve pain relief without toxicity (except in new, severe pain when step 2 may be omitted). • Paracetamol (PO/PR/IV) at step 1 may have an opiate-sparing eff ect, and should be continued at steps 2 and 3. Stop step 2 opioids if moving to step 3. • Use laxatives and anti-emetics with strong opioids. • Adjuvants which can be added at all steps include: NSAIDS, amitriptyline, pregaba- lin, corticosteroids, nerve block, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
