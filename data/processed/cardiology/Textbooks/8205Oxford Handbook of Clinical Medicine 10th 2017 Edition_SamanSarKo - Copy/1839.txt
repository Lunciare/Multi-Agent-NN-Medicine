involved. The aortic arch is often aff ected, with cerebral, ophthalmological, and upper limb symptoms, eg dizziness, visual changes, weak arm pulses. Systemic features are common—eg fever, weight loss, and malaise. BP is often a feature, due to renal artery stenosis. Complications include aortic valve regurgitation, aortic aneurysm and dissection; ischaemic stroke (BP and thrombus); and ischaemic heart disease. Diagnosis: ESR and CRP; MRI/PET allows earlier diagnosis than standard angiography. : Prednisolone (1mg/kg/d PO). Methotrexate or cyclophosphamide have been used in resistant cases. BP control is essential to risk of stroke. Angioplasty ± stenting, or bypass surgery is performed for critical stenosis. Prognosis: ~95% survival at 15 years.

Localized pain/tenderness at the costosternal junction, enhanced by motion, coughing, or sneezing. The 2nd rib is most often aff ected. The diagnostic key is localized tenderness which is marked (fl inches on prodding). Treatment: Simple analgesia, eg NSAIDS. Its importance is that it is a benign cause of what at fi rst seems to be alarming, eg cardiac pain. In lengthy ill- ness, local steroid injections may be used.
