insulin. Hyperglycae- mia is one aspect of a far-reaching metabolic derangement, which causes serious microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy) or macrovascular problems: stroke, MI, renovascular disease, limb ischaemia. So think of DM as a vascular dis- ease:1 adopt a holistic approach and consider other cardiovascular risk factors too. Categories of diabetes and dyslipidaemia Type 1 DM: Usually adolescent onset but may occur at any age. Cause: insulin de- fi ciency from autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting pancreatic  cells. Pa- tients must have insulin, and are prone to ketoacidosis and weight loss. Associated with other autoimmune diseases (>90% HLA DR3 ± DR4). Concordance is only ~30% in identical twins, indica ting environmental infl uence. Four genes are important: one (6q) determines islet sensitivity to damage (eg from viruses or cross-reactivity from cows’ milk-induced antibodies). Latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA) is a form of type 1 DM, with slower progression to insulin dependence in later life. Type 2 DM: (Formerly non-insulin-dependent DM, NIDDM) is at ‘epidemic’ levels in many places, mainly due to changes in lifestyle, but also because of better diagnosis and improved long evity.4 Higher prevalence in Asians, men, and the elderly (up to 18%). Most are over 40yrs, but
