Respiratory medicine exemplifi es how careful epidemiology, science, and randomized controlled trials have revolutionized our understanding of com- mon diseases, leading to preventative measures and eff ective treatments. How- ever, the importance of poverty and general improvements in public health cannot be underestimated. Rates of TB in the UK declined well before the introduction of BCG vaccination and streptomycin, largely due to improvements in sanitation and less dense living conditions. Public health campaigns and taxation have helped lower smoking rates, although reductions in lung cancer will lag behind for many years.
