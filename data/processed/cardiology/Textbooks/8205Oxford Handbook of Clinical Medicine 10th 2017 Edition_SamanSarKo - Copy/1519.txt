union between a conduit and the outside world—eg a colostomy, in which faeces are made to pass through an opening in the abdominal wall when a loop of colon is brought out onto the skin. NB: a stoma can also be made between two internal conduits (eg a choledochojejunostomy). Colostomies (Usually left illiac fossa and fl ush with the skin—fi g 13.8.) May be tem- porary or permanent. Are they suitable for a laparoscopic operation? • Loop colostomy: A loop of colon is exteriorized and partially divided, forming two stomas that are joined together (the proximal end passes stool, the distal end passes mucus, see fi g 13.6). A rod under the loop prevents retraction and may be removed after 7d. A loop colostomy is often temporary and performed to protect a distal anastomosis, eg after anterior resection. • End colostomy: The bowel is divided and the proximal end brought out as a stoma; the distal end may be: 1 resected, eg abdominoperineal (AP) resection (inspect the perineum for absent anus when examining a stoma) 2 closed and left in the abdo- men (Hartmann’s procedure) 3 exteriorized, forming a ‘mucous fi stula’. • Paul–Mikulicz colostomy: A double-barrelled colostomy in which
