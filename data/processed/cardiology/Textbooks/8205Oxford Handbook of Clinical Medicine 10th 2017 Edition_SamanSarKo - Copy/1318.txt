Management Urgent MRI and specialist referral guided by red fl ag symptoms (see p542). Bear in mind that although these are stressed in virtually every set of guidelines, no two lists are alike and review of evidence suggests that the accuracy of these features is low. Don’t make referral decisions based upon the presence or absence of a single feature, but use these to inform your judgement. Otherwise: give analgesia (as per WHO ladder) and encourage gentle activity. Cervical collars may give respite during brief periods of increased pain, but restrict mobility, so may prolong symptoms: avoid where possible. If no improvement in 4–6 weeks then MRI and consider neurosurgical referral for: interlaminar cervical epidural injections, transforaminal injections or surgical decompression (via anterior ap- proach, eg discectomy or posterior approach, eg laminectomy—fi g 10.29, or laminoplasty—fi g 10.30). There is no consensus or high-quality evidence to guide selection of approach or of patients, though interventions may be best reserved for those with progressive deterioration, myelopathy causing disabling neurologic
