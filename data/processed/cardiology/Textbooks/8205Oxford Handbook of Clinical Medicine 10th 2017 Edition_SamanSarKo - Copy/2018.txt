No blink in one fi eld suggests hemianopia and contralateral hemisphere lesion. 2 Pupils—normal direct and consensual refl exes present = intact midbrain. Midposition (3–5mm) non-reactive ± irregular = midbrain lesion. Unilateral dilated and unreactive (‘fi xed’) = 3rd nerve compression. Small, reactive = pontine lesion (‘pin-point pontine pupils’) or drugs. Horner’s syndrome (p702, fi g 15.4) = ipsilateral lateral medulla or hypothalamus lesion, may precede uncal herniation. Beware patients with false eyes or who use eye drops for glaucoma. 3 Extraocular movements (EOMS)—observe resting position and spontaneous movement; then test the vestibulo-ocular refl ex (VOR) with either the doll’s- head manoeuvre (normal if the eyes keep looking at the same point in space when the head is quickly moved laterally or vertically) or ice water calorics (normal if eyes deviate towards the cold ear with nystagmus to the other side). If present, the VOR exonerates most of the brainstem from the VIIth nerve nucleus (medulla) to the IIIrd (midbrain). Don’t move the head unless the cervical spine is cleared. 4 Fundi—papilloedema, subhyaloid haemorrhage, hypertensive retinopathy, signs of other disease (eg diabetic retinopathy). • Examine for CNS asymmetry (tone, spontaneous movements, refl exes).
