sepsis-related deaths could be prevented with earlier treatment. Often, the key failure in sepsis management is not recognizing sepsis in time. Early warning scores (p892, fi g A1) help identify inpatients who are becoming septic. Have a low threshold for assessing for sepsis if: • the patient has communication diffi culties: limited English; limited verbal com- munication; cognitive impairment • the patient is immunosuppressed, on chemotherapy, or an IV drug user • the patient recently had surgery or is pregnant/recently gave birth • the patient has indwelling lines/other foreign material.  Assessing risk in sepsis Table 19.3 Risk criteria in sepsis  Moderate- to high-risk criteria High-risk criteria Reports of altered mental state or acute Objective evidence of altered mental deterioration in functional status state Respiratory rate (RR) 21–24 RR>24; new requirement for FiO2 >40% to keep sats >92% (>88% in COPD) Systolic blood pressure (SBP) 91–100mmHg SBP <90 or >40mmHg less than baseline Heart rate 91–130bpm or new arrhythmia Heart rate >130bpm Urine output: nil for 12–18h; 0.5–1.0mL/kg/h Urine output: nil for 18h; <0.5mL/kg/h if if catheterized catheterized Local signs of infection, incl. redness, swell- Mottled, ashen, or cyanotic skin.
