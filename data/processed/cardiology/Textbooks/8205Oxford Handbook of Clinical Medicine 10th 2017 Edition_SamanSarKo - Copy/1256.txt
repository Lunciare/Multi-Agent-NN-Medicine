can be: •hyperactive, with restlessness, mood lability, agitation, or aggression •hypoactive in which the patient becomes slow and withdrawn or •mixed. Hypoactive and mixed delirium are much harder to recognize: it is crucial to compare current behaviour to the patient’s baseline (see BOX). Risk factors >65y, dementia/previous cognitive impairment, hip fracture, acute ill- ness, psychological agitation (eg pain). Causes • Surgery/post-GA. • Systemic infection: pneumonia, UTI, malaria, wounds, IV lines. • Intracranial infection or head injury. • Drugs/drug withdrawal: opiates, levodopa, sedatives, recreational. • Alcohol withdrawal (2–5d post-admission; LFTS, MCV; history of alcohol abuse). • Metabolic: uraemia, liver failure, Na+ or glucose, Hb, malnutrition (beriberi, p268). • Hypoxia: respiratory or cardiac failure. • Vascular: stroke, myocardial infarction. • Nutritional: thiamine, nicotinic acid, or B12 defi ciency. Diff erentials Dementia (see BOX), anxiety, epilepsy: non-convulsive status epi- lepticus is an underdiagnosed cause of impaired cognition and odd behaviour: con- sider an EEG. Primary mental illness (eg schizophrenia) can also mimic delirium, but this is rare on the wards (especially if no past history). Tests Look for the cause (eg UTI, pneumonia, MI): do FBC, U&E, LFT, blood glucose, ABG, septic screen (urine dipstick, CXR, blood cultures); also consider ECG, malaria fi
