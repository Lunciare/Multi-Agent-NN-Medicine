c for serine proteinase-3 (PR3 +ve). Granulom atosis with polyangiitis(Wegener’s) (90%);also microscopic polyangiitis(30%),pol- yarteritis nodosa (11%). • Perinuclear (pANCA), specifi c for myeloperoxidase (MPO +ve). Microscopic poly- angiitis (45%), Churg–Strauss, pulmonary-renal vasculitides (Goodpasture’s). Unlike immune-complex vasculitis, in ANCA-associated vasculitis no compl ement consumption or immune complex deposition occurs (ie pauci-immune vasculitis). 42 ANCA may also be +ve in UC/Crohn’s, sclerosing cholangitis, auto immune hepatitis, Felty’s, RA, SLE, or drugs (eg antithyroid, allopurinol, ciprofl oxacin). Neurological: Acetylcholine receptor Ab: myasthenia gravis (90%)(see p512). Anti-voltage-gated K +-channel Ab: limbic encephalitis. Anti-voltage-gated Ca 2+-channel Ab: Lambert–Eaton syndrome (see p512). Anti-aquaporin 4: neuromyelitis optica (Devic’s disease, p698). 5 Most centres now use anti-CCP antibodies for the initial workup of suspected RA. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 555533 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolotamuehR 554 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) SLE is a multisystemic autoimmune disease. Autoantibodies are made against a vari- ety of autoantigens (eg ANA) which form immune complexes . Inadequate clearance of immune complexes results in a host of immune responses which cause tissue infl ammation and damage. Environmental triggers play a part (eg EBV p405).43 Prevalence ~0.2%. :≈9:1, typically women of child-bearing age. Commoner in African-Caribbeans, Asians, and if HLA B8, DR2, or DR3 +ve. ~10% of patients have
