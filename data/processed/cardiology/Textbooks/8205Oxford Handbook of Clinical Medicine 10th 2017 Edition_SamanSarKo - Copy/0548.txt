to do at the same time. Sick euthyroidism: In any systemic illness, TFTS may become deranged. The typical pattern is for ‘everything to be low’. The test should be repeated after recovery. Assay interference is caused by antibodies in the serum, interfering with the test. Other tests • Thyroid autoantibodies: Antithyroid peroxidase (TPO; formerly called microsomal) antibodies or antithyro globulin antibodies may be increased in autoimmune thy- roid disease: Hashimoto’s or Graves’ disease. If +ve in Graves’, there is an increased risk of developing hypothyroidism at a later stage. • TSH receptor antibody: May be  in Graves’ disease (useful in pregnancy). • Serum thyroglobulin: Useful in monitoring the treatment of carcinoma (p600), and in detection of factitious (self-medicated) hyperthyroidism, where it is low. • Ultrasound: This distinguishes cystic (usually, but not always, benign) from solid (possibly malignant) nodules. If a solitary (or dominant) large nodule, in a multin od- ular goitre, do a fi ne-needle aspiration to look for thyroid cancer; see fi g 13.23, p601. • Isotope scan: (123Iodine, 99technetium pertechnetate, etc; see fi g 13.22, p601.) Useful for determining the cause of hyperthyroidism and to detect retrosternal goitre, ec- topic thyroid tissue or thyroid metastases (+ whole
