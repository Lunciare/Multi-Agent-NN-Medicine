Other possible causes: Lyme disease; HIV; zoster; diabetes mellitus; sarcoidosis; MS; paraneoplastic; B12. The iris may be patchily atrophied, irregular, and depigmented. The lesion site is not always near the Edinger–Westphal nucleus or even in the midbrain. Pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils occur in Parinaud’s syndrome (p708). • Hutchinson pupil: This is the sequence of events resulting from rapidly rising uni- lateral intracranial pressure (eg in intracerebral haemorrhage). The pupil on the side of the lesion fi rst constricts then widely dilates. The other pupil then goes through the same sequence. See p830. Fig 2.33 Light refl ex. Action potentials go along optic nerve (red), traversing optic chiasm, passing synapses at pre-tectal nu- cleus, en route to Edinger–Westphal nuclei of CNIII. These send fi bres to both irises’ ciliary muscles (so both pupils constrict) via ciliary ganglion (also relays accom- modation and corneal sensation, and gets sympathetic roots from C8–T2, carrying fi bres to dilate pupil). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 7722 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 noitanimaxe dna yrotsiH Fig 2.34 Internuclear ophthal- 73 moplegia (INO) and its causes.
