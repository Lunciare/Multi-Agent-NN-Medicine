pain tends to be less. 3 Is the obstructed bowel simple/closed loop/strangulated? Simple: one obstruct- ing point and no vascular compromise. Closed loop: obstruction at two points (eg sigmoid volvulus) forming a loop of grossly distended bowel at risk of perforation. Strangulated: blood supply is compromised and the patient is iller than you would expect. There is sharper, more constant, and localized pain. Peritonism is the cardi- nal sign. There may be fever + WCC with other signs of mesenteric ischaemia (p620). Causes See table 13.12. Table 13.12 Causes of bowel obstruction Causes: small bowel Causes: large bowel Rarer causes • Adhesions (p581) • Colon ca (p616) • Crohn’s stricture • Hernias (p612) • Constipation (p260) • Gallstone ileus (p634) • Diverticular stricture • Intussusception • Volvulus • TB (developing world) • Sigmoid (see BOX ‘Sigmoid • Foreign body volvulus’) • Caecal Management • General principles: Cause, site, speed of onset, and completeness of obstruction determine defi nitive therapy: strangulation and large bowel obstruction require surgery; ileus and incomplete small bowel obstruction can be managed conserva- tively, at least initially. • Immediate action: ‘Drip and suck’—NGT and IV fl uids to rehydrate and correct electrolyte imbalance (p668).
