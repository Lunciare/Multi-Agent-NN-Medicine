for the harder to treat genotypes 2 and 3. Here, reported rates of sustained undetectable viral levels now routinely exceed 90%. The costs of treatment are staggering, but cost-eff ec- tiveness analysis is favourable given the high cure rates and the signifi cant public health burden of HCV. Genotypes 4, 5, or 6 are prevalent in lower-income countries and have received less attention but limited data where resources do exist suggest similarly good response rates. Meanwhile, the threat of HIV remains. HCV prevalence is ~7% for sexually trans- mitted HIV and >90% for IV transmission. Untreated HIV may accelerate progress of HCV-induced liver fi brosis. All HIV/HCV co-infected patients should be assessed for combination antiviral therapy. Given the potential for toxicities and viral resist- ance mutation, such therapies should be planned and delivered through expert services. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 227799 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG 280 Alcoholism An alcoholic is one whose problematic pattern of alcohol use leads to clinically sig- nifi cant impairment or distress, manifested by multiple psychosocial, behavioural, or physiological features.
