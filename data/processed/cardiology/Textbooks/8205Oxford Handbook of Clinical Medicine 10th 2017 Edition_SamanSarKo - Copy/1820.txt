fl ow cytometric analysis of GPI-anchored proteins on peripheral blood cells. This can determine the size of the PNH clone and type of GPI defi ciency (complete or partial). : Most benefi t from supportive measures—but allogeneic stem cell transplantation is the only cure. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the C5 protein of the complement system. Blockade prevents activation of the complement distal pathway, reducing haemolysis, stabilizing haemoglobin, and reducing transfusion requirements.54 Fig 15.8 Urine and blood in PNH. In this 24h urine sample, the darkest hour is before dawn. Haemolysis occurs throughout the day and night, but the urine concentrated overnight pro- duces the dramatic change in colour.

Adverse eff ects of alcohol on the CNS • Inhibitions (risk taking; unsafe sex) • Wernicke’s encephalopathy • Korsakoff ’s syndrome • Hepatic encephalopathy • Cerebral atrophy (dementia) • Central pontine myelinolysis • Cerebellar atrophy (eg falls) • Stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) • Seizures • Marchiafava–Bignami syndrome. 3 In haemoglobinuria, urine dipstick will be positive for blood but microscopy of urine does not show RBCS (thus diff erentiating it from haematuria, but not myoglobinuria—where CK ± AST will be high). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 770055 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088
