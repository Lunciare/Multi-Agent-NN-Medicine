palpable. Tests: WCC, US—a thick-walled, shrunken GB (also seen in chronic disease), peri cholecystic fl uid, stones, CBD (dilated if >6mm). Plain AXR only shows ~10% of gallstones; it may identify a ‘porcelain’ GB (associated risk of cancer). Treatment: NBM, pain relief, IVI, and antibiotics, eg co-amoxiclav 625mg/8h IV. Lapa- roscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice for all patients fi t for GA. Open surgery is required if there is GB perforation. If elderly or high risk/unsuita ble for surgery,consi der percutaneous cholecystostomy; cholecystectomy can still be done later. Cholecystostomy is also the preferred treatment for acalculous cholecystitis. Chronic cholecystitis Chronic infl ammation ± colic. ‘Flatulent dyspepsia’: vague abdom inal discomfort, distension, nausea, fl atulence, and fat intolerance (fat stimu- lates cholecystokinin release and GB contraction). US to image stones and assess CBD diameter. MRCP (p742) is used to fi nd CBD stones. : Cholec ystectomy. If US shows a di- lated CBD with stones, ERCP (p742) + sphincterotomy before surgery. If symptoms per- sist post-surgery consider hiatus hernia/IBS/peptic ulcer/chronic pancreatitis/tumour. Other presentations • Obstructive jaundice with CBD stones: (See p272.) If LFT worsening, ERCP with sphincterotomy ± biliary trawl, then cholecystectomy may be needed, or open sur- gery
