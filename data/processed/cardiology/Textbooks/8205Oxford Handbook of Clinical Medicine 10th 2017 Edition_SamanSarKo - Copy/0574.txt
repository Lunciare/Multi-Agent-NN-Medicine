rate: <2%; false +ves: 2% normal, 13% obese, and 23% of inpatients. NB: false +ves (pseudo- Cushing’s) are seen in depression, obesity, alcohol excess, and inducers of liver enzymes (rate of dexamethasone metabolism, eg phenytoin, phenobarbital, ri- fampicin, p689). 24h urinary free cortisol (normal: <280nmol/24h) is an alternative. 2nd-line tests If 1st-line tests abnormal: 48h dexamethasone suppression test: Give dexamethasone 0.5mg/6h PO for 2d. Measure cortisol at 0 and 48h (last test at 6h after last dose). Again, in Cushing’s syndrome, there is a failure to suppress cortisol. 48h high-dose dexamethasone suppression test: (2mg/6h.) May distin- guish pituitary (suppression) from others causes (no/part suppression). Midnight cortisol: Admit (unless salivary cortisol used). Often inaccurate due to measure- ment issues. Normal circadian rhythm (cortisol lowest at midnight, highest early morning) is lost in Cushing’s syndrome. Midnight blood, via a cannula during sleep, shows cortisol  in Cushing’s. Localization tests (Where is the lesion?) If the 1st- and 2nd-line tests are +ve— Plasma ACTH. If ACTH is undetectable, an adrenal tumour is likely  CT/MRI adrenal glands. If no mass, proceed to adrenal vein sampling. If ACTH is detectable, dis- tinguish a pituitary cause from ectopic ACTH production by high-dose suppression test or
