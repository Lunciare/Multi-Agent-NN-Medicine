, circumduction of legs ± scuffi ng of the toe of the shoes: UMN lesions. Extrapyramidal: Flexed posture, shuffl ing feet, slow to start, postural instability, eg Parkinson’s disease. Apraxic: Pathognomonic ‘gluing-to-the-fl oor’ on attempting walking or a wide- based unsteady gait with a tendency to fall, like a novice on an ice-rink. Seen in normal pressure hydroc ephalus and multi-infarct states. Ataxic: Wide-based; falls; cannot walk heel-to-toe. Caused by cerebellar lesions (eg MS, posterior fossa tumours, alcohol, phenytoin toxicity); proprioceptive sen- sory loss (eg sensory neuropathy,  B12). Often worse in the dark or with eyes closed. Myopathic: Waddling gait, cannot climb steps or stand from sitting due to hip girdle weakness. Psychogenic: Suspect if there is a bizarre gait not conforming to any pattern of organic gait disturbance and without any signs when examined on the couch. Tests Spinal X-rays; MRI; FBC; ESR; syphilis serology; serum B12; U&E; LFT; PSA; serum electrophoresis; CXR; LP; EMG; muscle ± sural nerve biopsy. Non-neurological considerations in paralysed patients Avoid pressure sores by turning and review weight-bearing areas often. Use ap- propriate pressure-relieving mattresses/cushions. Prevent thrombosis in para- lysed limbs by frequent passive movement, pressure stockings, and LMWH (p350). Bladder care is
