diagnosis. The TNM system is most widely used and is based on the extent of tumour (T), spread to lymph nodes (N), and the presence of metastases (M) (table 11.1). Table 11.1 TNM cancer staging Tx Primary tumour cannot be measured Nx Nodes cannot be assessed T0 Primary tumour cannot be found N0 No node involvement Carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells Number/location of node T is present) N1–3 metastases Size and/or extent of primary tumour M0 No distant spread T1–4 (1=small tumour /minimal invasion; 4=large tumour/extensive invasion) M1 Distant metastases Other prefi xes may also be used: c refers to clinical stage; p is the stage after pathological examination; y refers to stage after neoadjuvant therapy; r is used if a tumour is re-staged after a disease-free interval; a indicates stage at autopsy. The TNM staging may be converted to an overall, less detailed classifi cation of cancer stage: 0–IV. Stage 0 refers to carcinoma in situ; Stages I–III describe the size of cancer and/or nearby spread; Stage IV indicates metastatic disease. Some cancers may have alternative staging systems such as Duke’s classifi ca- tion for colorectal cancer (p616). See also lung cancer (p176); breast cancer (p602); oesophageal cancer (p618);
