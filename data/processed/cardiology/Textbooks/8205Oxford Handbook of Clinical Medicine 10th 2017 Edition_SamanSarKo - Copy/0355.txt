when necessary. Modern systems are generally very reliable but pacing spikes with no capture afterwards suggests a problem. Programming of devices is complicated so seek help early if concerned. Many pacemakers store intracardiac electrograms which can be accessed to cor- relate rhythm with any symptoms. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 113322 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 133 Fig 3.36 ECG of a paced rhythm. Some pacemaker terms Fusion beat: Union of native depolarization and pacemaker impulse. Pseudofusion beat: The pacemaker impulse occurs just after cardiac depolariza- tion, so it is ineff ective, but it distorts the QRS morphology. Pseudopseudofusion beat: If a DVI pacemaker gives an atrial spike within a na- tive QRS complex, the atrial output is non-contributory. Pacemaker syndrome: In single-chamber pacing, retrograde conduction to the atria, which then contract during ventricular systole. This leads to retrograde fl ow in pulmonary veins, and cardiac output, dyspnoea, palpitations, malaise, and even syncope. Pacemaker-mediated tachycardia: Retrograde conduction to the atrium is sensed by the pacemaker and ventricular pacing delivered in response. This again causes retrograde atrial conduction causing a repetitive sensing/pacing loop. This can be fi xed by changing pacing programming parameters. Congenital arrhythmogenic cardiac conditions As well as the many acquired conditions that can
