infarcts: (50%.) Depending on site there may be contralateral sensory loss or hemiplegia— initially fl accid (fl oppy limb, falls like a dead weight when lifted), becoming spastic (UMN); dysphasia; homonymous hemianopia; visuo-spatial defi cit. Brainstem in- farcts: (25%.) Varied; include quadriplegia, disturbances of gaze and vision, locked- in syndrome (aware, but unable to respond). Lacunar infarcts: (25%). Basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, and pons.) Five syndromes: ataxic hemiparesis, pure mo- tor, pure sensory, sensorimotor, and dysarthria/clumsy hand. Cognition/conscious- ness are intact except in thalamic strokes. Acute management  Protect the airway: This avoids hypoxia/aspiration. • Maintain homeostasis: Blood glucose: keep between 4–11 mmol/L. Blood pressure: only treat if there is a hypertensive emergency (eg encephalopathy or aortic dissec- tion) or thrombolysis is considered (ideally aim for 185/110) as treating even very high BPS may impair cerebral perfusion. • Screen swallow: ‘Nil by mouth’ until this is done (but keep hydrated). • CT/MRI within 1h: Essential if: thrombolysis considered, high risk of haemorrhage (GCS, signs of ICP, severe headache, meningism, progressive symptoms, bleeding tendency or antic oagulated), or unusual presentation (eg fl uctuating consciousness, fever). Otherwise imaging less urgent (aim <24h). Diff usion-weighted MRI is most sensitive for an acute
