For example, the rate of clearance of creatinine can be used as a marker for the rate of fi ltration of fl uid and solutes in the glomerulus because it is only slightly reabsorbed from the renal tubule. The more of the fi ltered substance that is reabsorbed, however, the less accurate the estimate of GFR. MDRD (Modifi cation of Diet in Renal Disease Study Group): This provides an estimate of GFR from four simple parameters: serum creatinine, age, gender, and race (black/non-black). It is one of the best validated for monitoring patients with established moderately severe renal impairment,2 and most labs now routinely report estimated GFR (eGFR) using the MDRD equation on all U&E reports: eGFR = 32 788 ≈ serum creatinineΩ1 . 154 ≈ ageΩ0 . 203 ≈ [1 . 212 if black] ≈ [0 . 742 if female] However, a number of caveats exist, so that it is best used in monitoring declin- ing renal function rather than labelling elderly patients with mild renal impairment: • It is not validated for mild renal impairment, and therefore its use for screening general populations is questionable. • Inter-individual variations (and thus confi dence intervals) are wide, although for each
