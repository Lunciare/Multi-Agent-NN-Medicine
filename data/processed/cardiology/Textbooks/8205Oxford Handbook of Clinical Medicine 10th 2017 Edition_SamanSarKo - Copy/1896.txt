Used in both acute (after endoscopy and CT) and chronic GI bleeding, red cell scans are more sensitive than CT angiography and useful in intermittent bleeding, although localization can be challenging. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 773388 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR R DTe Pn Aa (l 9 9f mu Tn cc , t pi 6o 6n 9 )C ish r uo sm ediu tm o - a5 s1 s e(5 s1 sC Gr) F RE .
