recur rence rate of 30–50%. Investigations Look for provoking causes. Consider an EEG: it cannot exclude epi- lepsy and can be falsely +ve, so don’t do one if simple syncope is the likely diagno- sis. Only do emergency EEGS if non-convulsive status is the problem. Other tests: MRI (structural lesions); drug levels (if on anti-epileptics: is the patient compli- ant?); drugs screen; LP (eg if infection suspected). Counselling After any ‘fi t’, advise about dangers, eg swimming, driving, heights until the diagnosis is known; then give individualized counselling on employment, sport, insurance, and conception (OHCS p28). The patient must contact DVLA and avoid driving until seizure-free for >1yr (p159). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 449900 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN Seizure classifi cation 491 Focal seizures Originating within networks linked to one hemisphere and often seen with underlying structural disease. Various subclasses include: • Without impairment of consciousness: (Previously described as ‘simple’.) Awareness is unimpaired, with focal motor, sensory (olfactory, visual, etc.), au- tonomic, or psychic symptoms. No post-ictal symptoms. • With impairment of consciousness: (Previously described as ‘complex’.)Aware- ness is impaired—either at seizure onset or following a simple partial aura. Most commonly arise from the temporal lobe, in which post-ictal confusion is a fea- ture.
