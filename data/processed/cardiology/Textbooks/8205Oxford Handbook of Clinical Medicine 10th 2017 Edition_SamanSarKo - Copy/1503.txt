• infection (see earlier) • drugs (opiates, sedatives, and many others) • alcohol withdrawal (p280) • urinary retention • liver/renal failure. • MI or stroke Occasionally, sedation is necessary to examine the patient; consider lorazepam 1mg PO/IM (antidote: fl umazenil) or haloperidol 0.5–2mg IM. Reassure relatives that post- op confusion is common (seen in up to 40%) and reversible. Dyspnoea or hypoxia Any previous lung disease? Sit patient up and give O2, m onitor peripheral O2 sats by pulse oximetry (p162). Examine for evidence of: •pneum onia, pulmonary collapse, or aspiration •LVF (MI; fl uid overload) •pulmonary embolism (p190) •pneumothorax (p190; due to CVP line, intercostal block, or mechanical ventila- tion). Tests: FBC; ABG; CXR; ECG. Manage according to fi ndings. BP If severe, tilt bed head-down and give O2. Check pulse and BP yourself; compare it with pre-op values. Post-op BP is often from hypovolaemia resulting from inad- equate fl uid input, so check fl uid chart and replace losses. Monitor urine output (may need catheterization). A CVP line can help monitor fl uid resuscitation (normal is 0–5cmH2O relative to sternal angle). Hypovolaemia may also be caused by haem- orrhage so review wounds, drains, and abdomen. If unstable, return
