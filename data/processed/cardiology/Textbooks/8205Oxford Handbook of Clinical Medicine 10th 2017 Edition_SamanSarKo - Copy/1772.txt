(Antibodies) are synthesized by B cells. Five isoforms Ig A,D,E,G,M exist in humans, and IgG is the most abundant circulating form. Specifi c monoclonal band in paraproteinaemia (see p370). Diffusely raised in chronic infec- tions, TB, bronchiectasis, liver cirrhosis, sarcoidosis, SLE, RA, Crohn’s disease, 1° biliary cirrhosis, hepatitis, and parasitaemia. Low in nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption, malnutrition, and immune defi ciency states (eg severe illness, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, or congenital). Acute phase response The body responds to a variety of insults with, among other things, the synthesis, by the liver, of a number of proteins (normally present in serum in small quantities)—eg 1-antitrypsin, fi brinogen, complement, haptoglobin, and CRP. A concomitant reduction in albumin level, is characteristic of conditions such as infection, malignancy (especially 2-fraction), trauma, surgery, and infl ammatory disease. CRP So called because it binds to a polysaccharide (fraction C) in the cell wall of pneu- mococci. Levels help monitor infl ammation/infection (normal <8mg/L). Like the ESR, it is raised in many infl ammatory conditions, but changes more rapidly. It increases in hours and begins to fall within 2–3d of recovery; thus it can be used to follow disease activity (eg Crohn’s disease) or the response to
