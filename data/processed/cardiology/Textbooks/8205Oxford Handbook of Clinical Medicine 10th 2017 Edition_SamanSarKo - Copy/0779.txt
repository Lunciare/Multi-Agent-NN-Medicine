refl ect intravascular volume if right-sided heart disease/failure. BP, skin turgor, capillary refi ll changes may be late—do not wait for them. Hypovolaemia, fl uid resuscitation: • If hypovolaemic, renal perfusion will improve with volume replacement.4 • Care in cardiac disease (renal perfusion despite adequate circulating volume) and sepsis/third-spacing (extravascular volume). • Dynamic assessment is essential: examine before and after all fl uid given to ensure an adequate response and to reduce the risk of fl uid overload. 1 Give5 00mL crystalloid over 15 min. 2 Reassess fl uid state. Get expert help if unsure or if patient remains shocked. 3 Further boluses of2 50–500mL crystalloid with clinical review after each. 4 Stop when euvolaemic or seek expert help when2 L given. Which crystalloid? Any crystalloid can be used (follow local guidelines). 0.9% (‘normal’) saline is non-buff ered, contains chloride, and may cause hyperchlo- raemic acidosis. ‘Balanced’ or buff ered crystalloids include Hartmann’s, Ringer’s lactate, and Plasma-Lyte®. Because they are ‘balanced’ they are often used prefer- entially. However, they contain 4–5mmol/L of K+ so caution if K+and oligo/anuria. What about colloid? Blood components should be used in resuscitation due to haemorrhage. Human albumin solutions may be given only under specialist
