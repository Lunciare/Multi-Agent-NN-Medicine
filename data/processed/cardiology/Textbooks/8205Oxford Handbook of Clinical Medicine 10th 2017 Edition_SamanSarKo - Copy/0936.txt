relapsed disease: high-dose chem- otherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. Complications of treatment: See pp524–7. Radiotherapy may  risk of second malignancies—solid tumours (especially lung and breast, also melanoma, sarcoma, stomach and thyroid cancers), ischaemic heart disease, hypothyroidism, and lung fi brosis due to the radiation fi eld. Chemotherapy SE include myelosuppression, nausea, alopecia, infection. AML (p356), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and infertility may be due to both chemo- and radiotherapy—see p525. 5-year survival Depends on stage and grade (table 8.9): >95% in I-A lymphocyte- predomin ant disease; <40% with IV-B lymphocyte-depleted. Emergency presentations Infection; SVC obstruction—JVP, sensation of fullness in the head, dyspnoea, blackouts, facial oedema (seek expert help; see p528). 7 Thomas Hodgkin (1798–1866); rediscovered by Samuel Wilks (1824–1911) who magnanimously gave the disease Hodgkin’s name. 8 Eg BEACOPP (bleomycin/etoposide/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/vincristine/procarbazine/prednisone). In IIB, III, or IV, BEACOPP gives better initial control, but 7yr event-free survival is similar: 78% vs 71%. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 336600 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH Table 8.9 HL subtypes 361 Classifi cation (% of cases) Prognosis Nodular sclerosing (70%) Good Mixed cellularity* (20–25%) Good Lymphocyte rich (5%) Good Lymphocyte depleted* (<1%) Poor NB: nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin’s is recognized as a separate entity, behav ing as an indolent B-cell lymphoma.
