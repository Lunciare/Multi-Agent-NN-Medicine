MND in those >40yrs (median UK age at onset is 60) with stum- bling spastic gait, foot-drop ± proximal myopathy, weak grip (door-handles don’t turn) and shoulder abduction (hair-washing is hard), or aspiration pneumonia. Look for UMN signs: spasticity, brisk refl exes, plantars; and LMN signs: wasting, fascic- ulation of tongue, abdomen, back, thigh. Is speech or swallowing aff ected (bulbar signs)? Fasciculation is not enough to diagnose an LMN lesion: look for weakness too. Frontotemporal dementia occurs in ~25% (see BOX ‘Dignity and Dignitas’). Diagnostic criteria (See BOX ‘Revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria for ALS’). There is no diagnostic test. Brain/cord MRI helps exclude structural causes, LP helps exclude infl ammatory ones, and neurophysiology can detect subclinical denervation and help exclude mimicking motor neuropathies.14 Prognosis Poor, <3yrs post onset in half of patients. Management Adopt a multidisciplinary approach: neurologist, palliative nurse, hospi ce, physio, OT, speech therapist, dietician, social services—all orchestrated by the GP. Riluzole, an inhibitor of glutamate release and NMDA receptor antagonist, is the only medication shown to improve survival. Mulitple other drugs that have shown promise in animal models have failed to prove benefi t in clinical trials, includ- ing neurotrophic factors, anti-apoptotic agents, antioxidants, and
