In adults, this normally takes place in the central skeleton (vertebrae, sternum, ribs, skull) and proximal long bones. In some anaemias (eg thalassaemia), increased demand induces haematopoiesis beyond the marrow (extramedullary haematopoiesis), in liver and spleen, causing organomegaly. All blood cells arise from an early pluripotent stem cell, which divides asymmetrically to produce another stem cell and a progenitor cell committed to a lineage (see fi g 8.66). Committed progenitors further diff erentiate into myeloid or lymphocyte lineages, releasing their progeny into the blood. Pancytopenia Reduction in all the major cell lines: red cells, white cells, and platelets. Causes are due to: 1 Marrow production: Aplastic anaemia (see BOX), infi ltration (eg acute leukaemia, myelodysplasia, myeloma, lymphoma, solid tumours, TB), megalo- blastic anaemia, myelofi brosis (p366). 2 Peripheral destruction: Hypersplenism. Agranulocytosis Implies that granulocytes (WBCs with neutrophil, basophil, or eosin ophil granules) have stopped being made, leaving the patient at risk of fatal infections. Many drugs can be the culprit: eg carbimazole, procainamide, sulfona- mides, gold, clozapine, dapsone. When
