Porphyrin precursors are neurotoxic, while porphyrins themselves induce pho- tosensitivity and the formation of toxic free radicals. • Alcohol, lead, and iron defi ciency cause abnormal porphyrin metabolism. • Genetic counselling (OHCS p154) should be off ered to all patients and their families. Acute porphyrias Occur when the accumulation of porphyrinogen precursors pre- dominates, and are characterized by acute neurovisceral crises, though some forms have additional photosensitive cutaneous manifestations. Acute intermittent porphyria: (‘The Madness of King George.’) A low-penetrant autosomal dominant condition (porphobilinogen deaminase gene); 28% have no family history (de novo mutations). ~10% of those with the defective gene have neurovisceral symptoms. Attacks are intermittent, more common in women and those aged 18–40, and may be precipitated by drugs. Urine porphobilinogens are raised during attacks (the urine may go deep red on standing) and also, in ~50%, be- tween attacks. Faecal porphyrin levels are normal. There is never cutaneous photo- sensitivity. It is the commonest form of porphyria—prevalence in UK: 1–2/100 000. Variegate porphyria and hereditary coproporphyria: Autosomal dominant, char- acterized by photosensitive blistering skin lesions and/or acute attacks. The former is prevalent in Afrikaners in South Africa. Porphobilinogen is high only during an attack, and other metabolites may
