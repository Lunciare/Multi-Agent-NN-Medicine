height of the JVP with 5cm to obtain the right heart fi lling pressure in cm of water. A pressure above 9cm (4cm above the sternal angle at 45°) is elevated. Is the pulse venous (and not arterial)? • Usually impalpable, and obliterated by fi nger pressure on the vessel. • Rises transiently with pressure on abdomen (abdominojugular refl ux)2 or on liver (hepatojug ular refl ux), and alters with posture and respiration (disappears when patient sits from lying fl at). • Usually has a double pulse for every arterial pulse. See fi g 2.12. Abnormalities of the JVP • Raised JVP with normal waveform: Fluid overload, right heart failure. • Fixed raised JVP with absent pulsation: SVC obstruction (p528). • Large a wave: Pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary stenosis. • Cannon a wave: When the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve, large ‘cannon’ a waves result. Causes—complete heart block, single chamber ven- tricular pacing, ventricular arrhythmias/ectopics. • Absent a wave: Atrial fi brillation. • Large v waves: Tricuspid regurgitation—look for earlobe movement. • Constrictive pericarditis: High plateau of JVP (which rises on inspiration—Kuss- maul’s sign) with deep x and y descents. • Absent JVP: When lying fl at, the
