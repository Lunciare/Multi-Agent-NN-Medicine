Clinical features • Osteolytic bone lesions cause backache, pathological fractures and vertebral collapse. Do serum electrophoresis on all >50 with new back pain. • Hypercalcaemia may be symptomatic (p676). Lesions are due to osteoclast acti- vation, from signalling by myeloma cells. • Anaemia, neutropenia, or thrombocytopenia may result from marrow infi ltra- tion by plasma cells, leading to symptoms of anaemia, infection, and bleeding. • Recurrent bacterial infections due to immunoparesis, and also because of neutro- penia due to the disease and from chemotherapy. • Renal impairment due to light chain deposition (p314 & p370) is seen in up to 20% at diagnosis. The light chains have a toxic and infl ammatory eff ect on the proximal tubule cells, but the damage is mainly caused by precipitation of light chains in the distal loop of Henle. Deposits may rarely be AL-amyloid (causing nephrotic syn- drome, see p370). Monoclonal immunoglobulins also disrupt glomeruli. Tests Bloods: FBC: normocytic normochromic anaemia. Film: rouleaux (p328). Per- sistently ESR (p372). Urea and creatinine, Ca2+ (in ~40%). Alk phos usually  unless healing fracture. Bone marrow biopsy: See fi gs 8.70–8.73. Screening test: Serum and/or urine electrophoresis. 2-microglobulin (prognostic).
