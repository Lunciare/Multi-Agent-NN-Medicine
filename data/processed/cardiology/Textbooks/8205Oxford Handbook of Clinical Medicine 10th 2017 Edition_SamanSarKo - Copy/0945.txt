GVHD. Platelets must be ABO compatible. They are not used in ITP (p345). Indications: • Platelets <10≈109/L. • Haemorrhage (eg DIC, p352). • Before invasive procedures (eg biopsy, lumbar puncture) to increase count to >50≈109/L. 4U of platelets should raise the count to >40≈109/L in adults; check dose needed with lab. 3 Neutrophils: Use neutropenic regimen if the count <0.5≈109/L (p352). Bone marrow biopsy Gives diagnostic information where there are abnormalities in the peripheral blood; it is also an important staging test in the lymphoprolifera- tive disorders. Ideally take an aspirate and trephine usually from the posterior iliac crest (aspirates can be taken from the anterior iliac crest or sternum). The aspirate provides a fi lm which is examined by microscope. The trephine is a core of bone which allows assessment of bone marrow cellularity, architecture, and the presence of infi ltrative disease (eg neoplasia). Coagulation disorders may need to be corrected pre-biopsy. Apply pressure afterwards (lie on that side for 1–2h if platelets are low). Aplastic anaemia This is a rare (~5 cases per million/year) stem cell disorder in which bone marrow stops making cells, leading to pancytopenia. Presents with features of anaemia (Hb), infection (WCC), or bleeding (platelets).
