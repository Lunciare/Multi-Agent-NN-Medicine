upper gastrointestinal bleeding Causes • Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) 35–50%. • Gastroduodenal erosions 8–15%. • Oesophagitis 5–15%. • Mallory–Weiss tear 15%. • Varices 5–10%. • Other: upper GI malignancy, vascular malformations. Consider also facial trauma, nose bleed, or haemoptysis as causes of swallowed blood. Signs and symptoms (See pp56–63.) Haematemesis, or melaena, dizziness (espe- cially postural), fainting, abdominal pain, dysphagia? Hypotension (in young may be postural only), tachyc ardia (not if on -blocker), JVP, urine output, cool and clammy, signs of chronic liver disease (p276), eg telangiectasia, purpura, jaundice. NB: ask about previous GI problems, drug use, alcohol. Management Focus on circulation,12 see fi g 19.17. Risk stratify based upon, eg Rockall score (see table 6.6, p257). Is the patient shocked? • Peripherally cool/clammy; capillary refi ll time >2s; urine output <0.5mL/kg/h. • GCS or encephalopathy (p275). • Tachycardic (pulse >100bpm). • Systolic BP <100mmHg; postural drop >20mmHg. If shocked: See fi g 19.17 for management. If haemodynamically stable: • Insert two large-bore (14–16G) IV cannulae and take blood for FBC, U&E, LFT, clotting, and group & save. • Give IV fl uids (p821) to restore intravascular volume; avoid saline if cirrhotic/ varices; consider a CVP line to monitor and
