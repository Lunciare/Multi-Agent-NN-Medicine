attacks). Pain is strictly unilateral and almost always af- fects the same side. It lasts 15–180min, occurs once or twice a day, and is often nocturnal. Clusters last 4–12wks and are followed by pain-free periods of months or even 1–2yrs before the next cluster. Sometimes it is chronic, not episodic. Treatment Acute attack: ‘Keep calm ... carry oxygen’: give 100% O2 for ~15min via non-rebreathable mask (not if COPD); sumatriptan SC 6mg at onset (or zolmitriptan nasal spray 5mg). Preventives Avoid triggers: Eg alcohol. Medication: Consider: corticosteroids (short term only; many SE); verapamil 360mg, lithium 900mg (monitor carefully). Trigeminal neuralgia Symptoms: Paroxysms of intense, stabbing pain, lasting seconds, in the trigemi- nal nerve distribution. It is unilateral, typically aff ecting mandibular or maxillary div isions. The face screws up with pain (hence tic douloureux). Triggers: Wash- ing aff ect ed area, shaving, eating, talking, dental prostheses. Typical patient:  >50yrs old; in Asians : ≈ 2:1. Secondary causes: Compress ion of the trigemi- nal root by anomalous or aneurysmal intracranial vessels or a tumour, chronic meningeal infl am mation, MS, zoster, skull base malformation (eg Chiari). MRI: Is necessary to exclude secondary causes (~14% of cases). : Carba mazepine (start
