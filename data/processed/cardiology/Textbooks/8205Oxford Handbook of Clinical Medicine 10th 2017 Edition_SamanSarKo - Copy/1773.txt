more rapidly. It increases in hours and begins to fall within 2–3d of recovery; thus it can be used to follow disease activity (eg Crohn’s disease) or the response to therapy (eg antibiotics). CRP values in mild infl ammation 10–50mg/L; active bacterial infection 50–200mg/L; se- vere infection or trauma >200mg/L; see table 14.6. Urinary proteins Urinary protein loss >150mg/d is pathological (p294). Albuminuria Usually caused by renal disease (p294). Microalbuminuria: Urinary protein loss between 30 and 300mg/d (so not visible on normal dipstick) and may be seen with diabetes mellitus, BP, SLE, and glomerulonephritis (see p314 for role in DM). Can also be quantifi ed by measuring the urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (A:CR), usually a fi rst-in-the-morning spot urine sample. A level >30mg/mmol indi- cates albuminuria, and microalbuminuria is defi ned as >2.5mg/mmol in men and >3.5 in women. This is a useful screening test in diabetics, and subjects with reduced eGFR. Note some labs measure total urinary protein not albumin—a P:CR of 50, is equivalent to an A:CR of 30.20 Bence Jones protein Consists of light chains excreted in excess by some patients with myeloma (p368). They are not detected by dipsticks and may occur with normal serum electrophoresis. Haemoglobinuria
