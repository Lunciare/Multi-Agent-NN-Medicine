over 4h. Then 10mg/kg every 8h for next 48h or until patient can swallow (dose every 12h if patient has renal failure or hepatic dysfunction or if IV needed >48h). Convert to 600mg PO TDS to total quinine course 5–7d. Give with 7d oral doxycycline (clarithromycin in children/ pregnant). Side-eff ects: cinchonism (see earlier in topic), hyperinsulinaemia. Manage in a high dependency setting. Capillary permeability so vulnerable to pul- monary oedema if over-fi lled. Lactate levels may refl ect intravascular obstruction rather than circulating hypovolaemia. Monitor: blood glucose every 4h (2h if quinine infusion), Hb, clotting, electrolytes, creatinine. Daily parasite counts are suffi cient NB: will fl uctuate with the life cycle of the parasite (see p417) and an increase in fi rst 36h of treatment may not indicate treatment failure. Given the rapid action of artesu- nate, exchange transfusion is no longer considered to off er any additional benefi t. Pregnancy: Little evidence on use/safety of artesunate. On balance of risk (preg- nancy loss, pulmonary oedema, maternal mortality), artesunate should be given. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 441188 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI Non-falciparum malaria 419 P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, P. knowlesi: • If mixed infection with falciparum, treat as falciparum. •
