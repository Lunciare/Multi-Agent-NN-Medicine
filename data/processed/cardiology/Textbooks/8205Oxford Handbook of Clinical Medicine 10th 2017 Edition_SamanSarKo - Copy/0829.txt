chain disease, drugs (eg tenofovir), heavy metals. Diagnosis: IV bicarbonate increases bicarbonate loss in urine and causes rapid rise in urine pH to ~7.5. Treatment: bicarbonate and potassium replacement. Diuretics Osmotic diuretic (eg mannitol): Used to ICP and intra-ocular pressure. Freely fi ltered but poorly reabsorbed, holding water by osmosis. Na+, K+, Ca2+, ClΩ, Mg2+, HCOΩ may be aff ected. Risk of pulmonary oedema if oligo/anuric. Carbonic anhy- 3 drase inhibitor (eg acetazolamide): Used in altitude sickness, glaucoma. Meta- bolic acidosis due to bicarbonate excretion. Risk of nephrocalcinosis. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 331166 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR Thick ascending loop of Henle 317 Physiology Reabsorbs Na+ (~10–30%) and other electrolytes. Key transport via electroneutral Na+/K+/2ClΩ co-transporter. Pathology Bartter syndromes: Due to impaired salt transport in the thick ascending loop. Sodium reabsorption increases further along the nephron in exchange for K+ and H+  all cause a hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic, metabolic alkalosis. Usually pre- sent in childhood. Divided into subtypes depending on transport molecule defect. Type 1 mimics a loop diuretic. Elevated prostaglandin levels are also a feature. Treatment is with salt replacement and the use of NSAIDs (after volume repletion). Diuretics Loop diuretics (eg furosemide, bumetanide): Block the Na+/K+/2ClΩ co-trans- porter in the thick
