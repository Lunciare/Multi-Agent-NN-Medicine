sense of restlessness or unease ± repetitive, purposeless movements (stereotyp- ies, eg pacing). •Tardive myoclonus. •Tardive tourettism (p700). •Tardive tremor. Treating tardive dyskinesia: Gradually withdraw neuroleptics and wait 3–6 months. Tetrabenazine may help. Quetiapine, olanzapine, and clozapine are examples of atyp- ical antipsychotics that are less likely to cause tardive syndromes. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 446688 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN Dystonia 469 Dystonia describes prolonged muscle contractions causing abnormal posture or repetitive movements. Idiopathic generalized dystonia: Childhood-onset dystonia often starting in one leg with ipsilateral progression over 5–10yrs. Autosomal dominant inheritance is common (DYT1 deletion). Exclude Wilson’s disease and dopa-responsive dystonia (needs an L-dopa trial). Anticholinergics and muscle relaxants may help. Deep brain stimulation for refractory, disabling symptoms. Focal dystonias: Confi ned to one part of the body, eg spasmodic torticollis (head pulled to one side), blepharospasm (involuntary contraction of orbicularis oculi, OHCS p417), writer’s cramp. Focal dystonias in adults are typically idiopathic, and rarely generalize. They are worsened by stress. Patients may develop a geste an- tagoniste to try to resist the dystonic posturing (eg a touch of the fi nger to the jaw in spasmodic torticollis). Injection of botulinum toxin into the overactive muscles is usually eff ective. Acute dystonia: (fi g
