Interpreting results: • Hypoglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia (HH): Causes: insulinoma, sulfonylureas, insulin injection (no detectable C-peptide—only released with endogenous insulin); non- insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycaemia syndrome, mutation in the insulin-re- ceptor gene. Congenital HH follows mutations in genes involved in insulin secretion (ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1, CGK, HADH, SLC16A1, HNF4A, ABCC8, & KCNJ11).15 • Insulin low or undetectable, no excess ketones. Causes: non-pancreatic neoplasm; anti-insulin receptor antibodies. • Insulin, ketones. Causes: alcohol, pituitary insuffi ciency, Addison’s disease. Post-prandial hypoglycaemia May occur after gastric/bariatric surgery (‘dump- ing’, p623), and in type 2 DM. Investigation: Prolonged OGTT (5h, p206). Treatment See p834. If episodes are often, advise many small high-starch meals. If post-prandial glucose, give slowly absorbed carbohydrate (high fi bre). In diabet- ics, rationalize insulin therapy (p209). The defi nition of hypoglycaemia is context-dependent The brain stops working if plasma glucose levels get too low, so we are nervous of levels 3mmol/L. But some are asymptomatic at this level. So what is defi nitely abnormal? The answer may be 4mmol/L, allowing for inaccuracies in fi ngerprick BMS (NB: whole blood glucose is 10–15% < plasma glucose.) Think: ‘In this ill patient when can I be sure that a low glucose is not contr ibuting to
