swelling and consider surgical repair. Haematomas are high risk for infections. • Contrast reaction: this is usually mild with modern contrast agents. • Loss of peripheral pulse: may be due to dissection, thrombosis, or arterial spasm. Occurs in <1% of brachial catheterizations. Rare with femoral catheterization. • Angina: may occur during or after cardiac catheterization. Usually responds to sublingual GTN; if not, give analgesia and IV nitrates. • Arrhythmias: usually transient. Manage along standard lines. • Pericardial eff usion: suspect if unexplained continued chest pain. May need drain depending on severity and haemodynamic status. • Pericardial tamponade: rare, but should be suspected if the patient becomes hypo- tensive and anuric.  Urgent pericardial drain. • Infection: post-catheter pyrexia is usually due to a contrast reaction. If it persists for >24h, take blood cultures before giving antibiotics. Mortality <1 in 1000 patients, in most centres. Intracardiac electrophysiology This catheter technique can determine types and origins of arrhythmias, and locate and ablate problem areas, eg aberrant pathways in WPW or arrhythmogenic foci. Arrhythmias may be induced, and the eff ectiveness of control by drugs assessed. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 111122 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC (a) 113 (b) (c) Fig 3.18 (a) Coronary artery anatomy.
