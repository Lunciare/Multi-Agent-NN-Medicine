tenofovir, entecavir). The aim is to clear HBSAg and prevent cir- rhosis and HCC (risk is  if HBSAg and HBeAg +ve). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA fl avivirus. Spread: Blood: transfusion, IV drug abuse, sexual contact. UK prevalence: >200 000. Early infection is often mild/asympto- matic. ~85% develop silent chronic infection; ~25% get cirrhosis in 20yrs—of these, 4% get hepatocellular cancer (HCC)/yr. Risk factors for progression: Male, older, higher viral load, use of alcohol, HIV, HBV. Tests: LFT (AST : ALT <1 : 1 until cirrhosis develops, p276), anti-HCV anti bodies confi rms exposure; HCV-PCR confi rms ongoing infection/chronicity; liver biopsy or non-invasive elastography if HCV-PCR +ve to as- sess liver damage and need for treatment. Determine HCV genotype (1–6). : BOX; quit alcohol. Other complications: Glomerulonephritis; cryoglobulin aemia; thyroiditis; autoimmune hepatitis; PAN; polymyositis; porphyria cutanea tarda. Hepatitis D virus (HDV) Incomplete RNA virus (needs HBV for its assembly). HBV vac- cination prevents HDV infection. 5% of HBV carriers have HDV co-infection. It may cause acute liver failure/cirrhosis. Tests: Anti-HDV antibody (only ask for it if HBsAg +ve). : As interferon alfa has limited success, liver transplantation may be needed. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) RNA virus. Similar to HAV;
