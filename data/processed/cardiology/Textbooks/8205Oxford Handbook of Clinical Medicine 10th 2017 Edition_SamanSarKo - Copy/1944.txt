According to Poiseuille’s law1 the fl ow rate (Q) of a fl uid through a tubular structure is inversely proportional to viscosity (η) and length (l ) and proportional to the pressure diff erence across it (Pi Ω Po) and the radius t o the power of 4(r 4). Hence: Q ∝ (Pi Ω η P lo) r 4 A last throw of the dice Just once it may come down to you. For some, this is one of the challenges and thrills in medicine. There may be no one else available to help when there is an absolute and urgent indication for IV drugs/fl uids/blood—and all of the previously discussed measures have been tried, and have failed.
