Specialist advice is vital. It should only be considered if the patient is likely to become malnourished with- out it—this normally means that the gastrointestinal tract is not functioning (eg bowel obstruction), and is unlikely to function for at least 7d. Parenteral feeding may supplement other forms of nutrition (eg in short bowel syndrome or active Crohn’s disease, when nutrition cannot be suffi ciently absorbed in the gut) or it can be used alone (total parenteral nutrition—TPN). Even if there is GI disease, studies show that enteral nutrition is safer, cheaper, and at least as effi cacious as parenteral nutrition in the perioperative period.5 Administration Nutrition must be given via a dedicated central venous line (or peripherally inserted central catheter—PICC line) or via a dedicated lumen of a multi- lumen catheter (see fi gs 13.9 and 13.10).
