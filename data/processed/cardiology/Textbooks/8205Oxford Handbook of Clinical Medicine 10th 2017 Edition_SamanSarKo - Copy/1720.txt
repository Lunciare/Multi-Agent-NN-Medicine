Urine osmolality (>plasma osmolality), urine Na+ (>20mmol/L). Some immunodefi ciency states Normal serum albumin but low total protein (because immunoglobulins are missing. Also makes crossmatching diffi cult because expected haemagglutinins are absent; OHCS p198). 1 Dehydration aff ects urea more than creatinine because in dehydration a greater proportion of fi ltered urea is reabsorbed by the kidney. Creatinine is hardly reabsorbed at all. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 666644 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC Laboratory results: when to take action NOW 665 • On receiving a dangerous result, fi rst check the name and date. • Go to the bedside. If the patient is conscious, turn off any IVI (until fl uid is checked: a mistake may have been made) and ask the patient how he or she is. Any fi ts, faints, collapses, or unexpected symptoms? • Be sceptical of an unexpectedly, wildly abnormal result with a well patient. Com- pare with previous values. Could the specimens have got muddled up; whose is it? Is there an artefact? Was the sample taken from the ‘drip’ arm? Is a low cal- cium due to a low albumin (p676)? Perhaps the lab is using a new analyser with a faulty wash cycle? When in doubt, seek
