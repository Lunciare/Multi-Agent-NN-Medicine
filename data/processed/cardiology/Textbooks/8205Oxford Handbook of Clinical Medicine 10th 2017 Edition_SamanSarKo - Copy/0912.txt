or in place of LMWH for prophylaxis. Beginning therapeutic anticoagulation (Follow local guidelines, and see BNF.) For treatment of venous thromboembolism, LMWH or UFH are typically used initially. When transitioning to warfarin, give heparin in combination (as early as day 1) and continue until INR is in target therapeutic range on 2 consecutive days (see BOX ‘War- farin dosage’). Start warfarin at 5–10mg given at 18.00 on days 1 and 2, then check INR on day 3 (it takes 48–72h for anticoagulant eff ect to develop). Adjust subsequent doses according to the INR (see table 8.5), which needs to be measured on alternate days until stable, then weekly or less often. When transitioning to a DOAC switch from heparin (ie do not coadminister DOAC and heparin). DOACS and warfarin may both be initiated as monotherapy in chronic AF (DOACS also in less extensive thromboembolism). Antidotes If UFH overdose: stop infusion. If there is bleeding, protamine sulphate counteracts UFH: discuss with a haematologist. Warfarin: see BOX ‘Warfarin dos- age’ and table 8.6. DOACS: challenging and evolving area (including monoclonal anti-drug antibodies eg idarucizumab for dabigatran)—discuss with haematologist. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 335500 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH Warfarin guidelines and target levels for INR 351 •
