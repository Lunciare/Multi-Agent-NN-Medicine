SE: nausea; diarrhoea (try modifi ed-release version); abdominal pain; not hypoglycaemia. Avoid if eGFR 36mL/min (due to risk lactic acidosis). DPP4 inhibitors/gliptins: (Eg sitagliptin.) Block the action of DPP-4, an enzyme which destroys the hormone incretin. Glitazone:  insulin sensitivity; SE: hypo glycaemia, fractures, fl uid retention, LFT (do LFT every 8wks for 1yr, stop if ALT up >3-fold). CI: past or present CCF; osteoporosis; monitor weight, and stop if  or oedema. Sulfonylurea:  insulin secretion; eg gliclazide 40mg/d. SE: hypoglycaemia (moni- tor glucose); it  weight.
