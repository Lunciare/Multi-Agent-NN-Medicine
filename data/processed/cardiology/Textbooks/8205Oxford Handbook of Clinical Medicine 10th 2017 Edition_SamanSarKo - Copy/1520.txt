Each end is exteriorized as two separate stomas. Output: Colostomies ideally pass 1–2 formed motions/day into an adherent plastic pouch. Some may be managed with irrigation, thus avoiding a pouch. Incidence: 21 000 stomas/yr in UK (>50% are permanent). Most manage their stomas well. The cost for appliances is ~£1500/yr. If there is a skin reaction to the adhesive or pouch, a change of device may be all that is needed. Contact the stoma nurse. Ileostomies (Usually right illiac fossa.) Protrude from the skin and emit frequent fl uid motions which contain active enzymes (so the skin needs protecting—see fi g 13.7). Loop ileostomies can be formed to defunction the colon as a temporary meas- ure eg during control of diffi cult perianal Crohn’s disease. End ileostomy follows total or subtotal c olectomy, eg for UC; subsequent formation of ileal pouch-anal anasto- mosis (pouch of ileum is joined to the upper anal canal) can allow for stoma
