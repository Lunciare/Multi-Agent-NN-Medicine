tent period between exposure and development of the tumour may be up to 45yrs. Compensation is often available. Clinical features: Chest pain, dyspnoea, weight loss, fi nger clubbing, recurrent pleu- ral eff usions. Signs of metastases: lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, bone pain/ten- derness, abdominal pain/obstr uction (peritoneal malignant mesothelioma). Tests: CXR/CT: pleural thickening/eff usion. Bloody pleural fl uid. Diagnosis: Made on histology, usually following a thoracoscopy. Often the diagnosis is only made post-mortem. Management: Pemetrexed + cisplatin chemotherapy can improve survival. 24 Surgery is hard to evaluate (few randomized trials). Radiotherapy is controversial. Pleurodesis and indwelling intra-pleural drain may help. Prognosis: Poor (especially without pemetrexed, eg <2yrs). >650 deaths/yr in UK. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 117744 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem tsehC Diff erential diagnosis of nodule in the lung on a CXR 175 • Malignancy (1° or 2°) • Arterio-venous malformation • Abscesses (p170) • Encysted eff usion (fl uid, blood, pus) • Granuloma • Cyst • Carcinoid tumour • Foreign body • Pulmonary hamartoma • Skin tumour (eg seborrhoeic wart).
