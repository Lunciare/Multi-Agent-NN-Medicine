that infarction that crosses boundaries between arterial territories may be venous in origin. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 448811 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 482 Subdural haematoma Consider this very treatable condition in all whose conscious level fl uctuates, and also in those having an ‘evolving stroke’, especially if on anticoagulants. Bleeding is from bridging veins between cortex and venous sinuses (vulnerable to decelera- tion injury), resulting in accumulating haematoma between dura and arachnoid. This gradually raises ICP, shifting midline structures away from the side of the clot and, if untreated, eventual tentorial herniation and coning. Most subdurals are from trauma but the trauma is often forgotten as it was so minor or so long ago (up to 9 months). It can also occur without trauma (eg ICP; dural metasta ses). The elderly are most susceptible, as brain atrophy makes bridging veins vulnerable. Other risk factors: falls (epileptics, alcoholics); anticoagulation. Symptoms Fluctuating level of consciousness (seen in 35%) ± insidious physical or intellectual slowing, sleepiness, headache, personality change, and unsteadiness. Signs ICP (p830), seizures. Localizing neurological symptoms (eg unequal pupils, hemiparesis) occur late, often >1 month after the injury. Diff erentials Stroke, dementia, CNS masses (eg tumours, abscesses). Imaging (fi g 10.22) CT/MRI shows clot ±
