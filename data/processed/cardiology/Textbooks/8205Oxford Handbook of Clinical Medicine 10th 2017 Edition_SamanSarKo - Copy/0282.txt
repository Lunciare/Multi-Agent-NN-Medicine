and QRSS appear independently of each other. As tissue distal to the AVN paces slowly, the patient becomes very bradycardic, and may develop haemo- dynamic compromise. Urgent treatment is required. Causes: IHD (esp inferior MI), idiopathic (fi brosis), congenital, aortic valve calcifi ca tion, cardiac surgery/trauma, digoxin toxicity, infi ltration (abscesses, granulomas, tumours, parasites). ST elevation Normal variant (high take-off ), acute MI (STEMI), Prinzmetal’s angina (p708), acute pericarditis (saddle-shaped), left ventricular aneurysm. ST depression Normal variant (upward sloping), digoxin toxicity (downward sloping), ischaemic (horizontal): angina, NSTEMI, acute posterior MI (ST depression in V1–V3). T inversion In V1–V3: normal (black patients and children), right bundle branch block (RBBB), RV strain (eg secondary to PE). In V2–V5: anterior ischaemia, HCM, subarachnoid haemorrhage, lithium. In V4–V6 and aVL: lateral ischaemia, LVH, left bundle branch block (LBBB). In II, III and aVF: inferior ischaemia. NB: ST- and T-wave changes are often non-specifi c, and must be interpreted in the light of the clinical context. Myocardial infarction (See p118 and fi g 3.21; example ECGs fi gs 3.9, 3.10) • Within hours, the T wave may become peaked and ST segments may begin to rise. • Within 24h, the T wave inverts.
