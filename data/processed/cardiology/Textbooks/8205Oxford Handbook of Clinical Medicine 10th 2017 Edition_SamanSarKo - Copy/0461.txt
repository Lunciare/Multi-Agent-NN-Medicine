Aff ects 1–5% of asthmat- ics, 2–25% of CF patients.26 Initially bronchoconstriction, then permanent dam- age occurs causing bronchiectasis (fi g 4.9). Symptoms: wheeze, cough, sputum (plugs of mucus containing fungal hyphae, see p408), dyspnoea, and ‘recurrent pneumonia’. Investigations: CXR (transient segmental collapse or consolida- tion, bronchiectasis); Aspergillus in sputum; positive Aspergillus skin test and/ or Aspergillus-specifi c IgE RAST (radioallergosorbent test); positive serum pre- cipitins; eosinophilia; raised serum IgE. Treatment: prednisolone 30–40mg/24h PO for acute attacks; maintenance dose 5–10mg/d. Itraconazole can be used in combination with corticosteroids. Bronchodilators for asthma.
