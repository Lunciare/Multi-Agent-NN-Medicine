allergen exposure). Hoarseness Eg due to laryngitis, recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, Singer’s (OHCS p568) nodules, or laryngeal tumour. Wheeze (p52) Fever/night sweats (p29) Chest pain SOCRATES (see p36), usually ‘pleuritic’ if respiratory (ie worse on (p94 & p784) inspiration?). Stridor (see BOX ‘Stridor’) History Ask about current symptoms (table 2.5) and past history: pneumonia/bron- chitis; TB; atopy3 (asthma/eczema/hay fever); previous CXR abnormalities; lung surgery; myopathy; neurological disorders. Connective tissue disorders, eg rheumatoid, SLE. Drug history Respiratory drugs (eg steroids, bronchodilators)? Any other drugs, esp- ecially with respiratory SE (eg ACE inhibitors, cytotoxics, -blockers, amiodarone)? Family history Atopy?3 Emphysema? TB? Social history Quantify smoking in ‘pack-years’ (20 cigarettes/day for 1 year = 1 pack-year). Occupational exposure (farming, mining, asbestos) has possible compen- satory implications. Pets at home (eg birds)? Recent travel/TB contacts? Stridor Inspiratory sound due to partial obstruction of upper airways. Obstruction may be due to something within the lumen (eg foreign body, tumour, bilateral vocal cord palsy), within the wall (eg oedema from anaphylaxis, laryngospasm, tumour, croup, acute epiglottitis, amyloidosis), or extrinsic (eg goitre, oesophagus, lymph- adenopathy, post-op stridor, after neck surgery). It’s an emerge ncy (p772) if gas exchange is compromised. NB: wheeze is an expiratory sound. Characteristic
