bacilli and Pneumocystis jirovecii (for- merly named P. carinii, pp400–1). Other fungi, viruses (CMV, HSV), and mycobacteria. Clinical features Symptoms: Fever, rigors, malaise, anorexia, dyspnoea, cough, purulent sputum, haemoptysis, and pleuritic pain. Signs: Pyrexia, cyanosis, confus- ion (can be the only sign in the elderly—may also be hypothermic), tachypnoea, tachycardia, hypotension, signs of consolidation (reduced expansion, dull percus- sion, tactile vocal fremitus/vocal resonance, bronchial breathing), and a pleural rub. Tests Assess oxygenation: oxygen saturation, p162 (ABGs if SaO2 <92% or severe pneumonia) and BP. Blood tests: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP (GPs should consider a point of care CRP to guide antibiotic prescribing where LRTI is suspected, NICE 20144). CXR (fi g 16.2, p723): lobar or multilobar infi ltrates, cavitation, or pleural eff usion. Spu- tum for microscopy and culture. Urine: check for Legionella/Pneumococcal urinary antigens. Atypical organism/viral serology (PCR sputum/BAL, complement fi xation tests acutely, paired serology). Pleural fl uid may be aspirated for culture. Respira- tory physicians may consider bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage if patient is immunocompromised or on ITU.
