Handbook of Clinical medicine

via a dedicated central venous line (or peripherally inserted central catheter—PICC line) or via a dedicated lumen of a multi- lumen catheter (see fi gs 13.9 and 13.10). Requirements There are many diff erent regimens for parenteral feeding. Most provide 2000kCal and 10–14g nitrogen in 2–3L; this usually meets a patient’s daily requirements (see table 13.6, p585). ~50% of calories are provided by fat and ~50% by carbohydrate. Regimens comprise vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and elec- trolytes; these will normally be included by the pharmacist. Complications • Sepsis: (eg Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus; Candida; Pseudomonas; infective endocarditis.) Look for spiking pyrexia and examine wound at tube insertion point. Stop PN, take line and peripheral cultures and give antibiotics via the line. If central venous line-related sepsis is suspected, the safest course of action is always to remove the line. Do not attempt to salvage a line when Staph. aureus or Candida infection has been identifi ed. • Thrombosis: Central vein thrombosis may occur, resulting in pulmonary embolus or superior vena caval obstruction (p528). • Metabolic imbalance: Electrolyte abnormalities—see BOX ‘Refeeding syndrome’; deranged plasma glucose; hyperlipidaemia; defi ciency syndromes (table 6.9, p268); acid-base disturbance (eg hypercapnia from excessive CO2 production).
