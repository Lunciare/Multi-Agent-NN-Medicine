(p736). • Following abdominal surgery. Contrast medium (p748) Enhance anatomical detail by use of a high- or low (water)-attenuating medium to fi ll the lumen of a structure. Give IV to image vascu- lar anatomy (fi g 16.12) and vascular structures (including highly perfused tumours). Images acquired at diff erent times (‘phases’) after injection will show the agent in arterial or venous structures or during ‘washout’ (=clearing). Perfusion CT maps cerebral blood fl ow by acquiring serial images after contrast administration then combines these into a colour-coded image of perfusion times (fi g 16.14). Ensure IV cannulae secure and suffi cient gauge to allow for rapid injection of agent as bolus— extravasation of contrast can cause signifi cant tissue damage. Give PO eg 1–12h before imaging bowel. Give PR for examining distal colonic lumen. Contrast-enhanced CTS may include a pre-contrast series. Unenhanced imaging alone reduces radiation exposure and may be adequate for images of the brain, spine, lung, and musculoskeletal system or necessary in those with renal failure (contrast is nephrotoxic). Streak artefact Remember that the CT slice image is a matrix representation of the attenuation produced by rotating around the patient. High-attenuation items such as metal fi llings, clips,
