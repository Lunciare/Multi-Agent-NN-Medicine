classifi ed neatly: vascular causes may have infective origins, eg hydatid cyst may count as a foreign body, and infection, and vascular if it fi stulates with the aorta; ditto for infected (mycotic) aneurysm rupture, or TB aortitis. Infective causes entailing coagu lopathy: dengue; leptospirosis. In monthly haemoptysis, think of lung endometriosis. : Haemoptysis may need treating in its own right, if massi ve (eg trauma, TB, hydatid cyst, cancer, AV malformation): call chest team, consider interventional radiology input (danger is drowning: lobe resection, endobronchial tamponade, or arterial embolization may be needed). Set up IVI, do CXR, blood gases, FBC, INR/APTT, crossmatch. If distressing, give prompt IV morphine, eg if inoperable malignancy. Dyspnoea Subjective sensation of shortness of breath, often exacerbated by exertion. • Lung—airway and interstitial disease. May be hard to separate from cardiac causes; asthma may wake patient, and cause early morning dyspnoea & wheeze. • Cardiac—eg ischaemic heart disease or left ventricular failure (LVF), mitral ste- nosis, of any cause. LVF is associated with orthopnoea (dyspnoea worse on lying; ‘How many pillows?’) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND; dyspnoea waking one up). Other features include ankle oedema, lung crepitations, and JVP. • Anatomical—eg diseases of the chest wall,
