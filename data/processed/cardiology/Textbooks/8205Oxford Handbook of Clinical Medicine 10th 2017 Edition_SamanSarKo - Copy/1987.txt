Peripherally inserted central cannulas (PICC lines) These are a good alternative to central lines, as they can stay in situ for up to 6 months, and provide access for blood sampling, fl uids, antibiotics (allowing home IV therapy). They are placed using a Seldinger technique, puncturing the brachial or basilic vein then threading the line into the subclavian or superior vena cava. Because of the insertion site there is a much lower risk of
