2 or complete heart block (whether or not MI has occurred); do 24h ECG; liaise with the anaesthetist. • Drug poisoning, eg with -blockers, digoxin, or verapamil. • Symptomatic bradycardia, uncontrolled by atropine or isoprenaline. • Suppression of drug-resistant VT and SVT (overdrive pacing; do on ICU). • Asystolic cardiac arrest with P-wave activity (ventricular standstill). • During or after cardiac surgery—eg around the AV node or bundle of His. Technique for temporary transvenous pacing Learn from an expert. • Preparation: Monitor ECG; have a defi brillator to hand, ensure the patient has pe- ripheral access; check that a radiographer with screening equipment is present. If you are screening, wear a protective lead apron. • Insertion: Using an aseptic technique, place the introducer into the (ideally right) internal jugular vein (p775) or subclavian. If this is diffi cult, access to the right atrium can be achieved via the femoral vein. Pass the pacing wire through the introducer into the right atrium, ideally under radiological screening. It will either pass easily through the tricuspid valve or loop within the atrium. If the latter oc- curs, it is usually possible to fl ip the wire across the valve with a combined twisting
