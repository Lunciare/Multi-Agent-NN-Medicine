through the tricuspid valve or loop within the atrium. If the latter oc- curs, it is usually possible to fl ip the wire across the valve with a combined twisting and withdrawing movement (fi g 18.19). Advance the wire slightly. At this stage the wire may try to exit the ventricle through the pulmonary outfl ow tract. A further withdrawing and rotation of the wire will aim the tip at the apex of the right ven- tricle. Advance slightly again to place the wire in contact with the endocardium. Remove any slack to risk of subsequent displacement. • Checking the threshold: Connect the wire to the pacing box and set the ‘demand’ rate slightly higher than the patient’s own heart rate and the output to 3V. A paced rhythm should be seen. Find the pacing threshold by slowly reducing the voltage until the pacemaker fails to stimulate the tissue (pacing spikes are no longer fol- lowed by paced beats). The threshold should be less than 1V, but a slightly higher value may be acceptable if it is stable—eg after a large infarction. • Setting the pacemaker: Set the output to 3V or over 3 times the threshold value (whichever is
