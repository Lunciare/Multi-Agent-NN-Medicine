mouth for 6h before. Don’t drive for 24h if sedation is used. Procedure: Sedation optional, eg midazolam 1–5mg slowly IV (to remain conscious; if deeper sedation is needed, propofol via an anaesthetist (narrow therapeutic range)); nasal prong O2 (eg 2L/min; monitor respirations & oximetry). The pharynx may be sprayed with local anaesthetic before the endoscope is passed. Con- tinuous suction must be available to prevent aspiration. Complications: Sore throat; amnesia from sedation; perforation (<0.1%); bleeding (if on aspirin, clopidogrel, war- farin, or DOACS these need stopping only if therapeutic procedure). Duodenal biopsy: The gold standard test for coeliac disease (p266); also useful in unusual causes of malabsorption, eg giardiasis, lymphoma, Whipple’s disease. Sigmoidoscopy Views the rectum + distal colon (to ~splenic fl exure). Flexible sigmoidoscopy has largely displaced rigid sigmoidoscopy for diagnosis of distal colonic pathology, but ~25% of cancers are still out of reach. It can be used thera- peutically, eg for decompression of sigmoid volvulus (p611). Preparation: Phosphate enema PR. Procedure: Learn from an expert; do PR exam fi rst. Do biopsies—macro- scopic appearances may be normal, eg IBD, amyloidosis, microscopic colitis. Colonoscopy Indications: See table 6.3. Preparation: Stop iron 1wk prior; dis- cuss with local endoscopy unit
