Fig 9.5 Streptococci are grouped by haemolytic pattern (, , or non-haemolytic), by Lancefi eld antigen (A–G), or by species. Rebecca Lancefi eld (1895–1981) is shown with her hand lens, typing streptococci with a variety of M protein-specifi c anti- bodies. Her lab became known as the ‘Scotland Yard of Strepto- coccal Mysteries’ after she found that the most grievous crimes of streptococci almost always involve M as a secret accomplice. Although she arrested M on many occasions, M outlived her, and still stalks our wards and clinics. ©Dr V Fischetti, Rockefeller University, NY. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 338899 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI 390 Gram-negative bacteria Gram-negative cocci Neisseria: Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) is an upper respiratory tract commensal in ~10%
