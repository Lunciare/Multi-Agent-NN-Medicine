It is characterized by recurrent episodes of dyspnoea, cough, and wheeze caused by reversible airways obstruction. Three fac- tors contribute to airway narrowing: bronchial muscle contraction, triggered by a variety of stimuli; mucosal swelling/infl ammation, caused by mast cell and basophil degranulation resulting in the release of infl ammatory mediators; and increased mucus production. Symptoms Intermittent dyspnoea, wheeze, cough (often nocturnal), and sputum (see table 4.5). Precipitants: Cold air, exercise, emotion, allergens (house dust mite, pollen, fur), infection, smoking and passive smoking,29 pollution, NSAIDS, -blockers. Diurnal variation Symptoms or peak fl ow may vary over the day. Marked morning dipping of peak fl ow is common and can tip the balance into a serious attack, despite having normal peak fl ow (fi g 4.12) at other times. Exercise: Quantify the exercise tolerance. Disturbed sleep: Quantify as nights per week (a sign of severe asthma). Acid
