useful when managing painful anal condi- tions, eg fi ssure. Arachis oil enemas lubricate and soften impacted faeces. Liquid paraffi n should not be used for a prolonged period (SE: anal seepage, lipoid pneu- monia, malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins). Osmotic laxatives: Retain fl uid in the bowel. Lactulose, a semisynthetic disaccharide, produces osmotic diarrhoea of low faecal pH that discourages growth of ammonia-producing organisms. It is useful in hepatic encepha lopathy (initial dose: 30–50mL/12h). SE: bloating, so its role in treating constipation is limited. Macrogol (eg Movicol®) is another ex- ample. Magnesium salts (eg magnesium hydroxide; magnesium sulfate) are use- ful when rapid bowel evacuation is required. Sodium salts (eg Microlette® and Micralax® enemas) should be avoided as they may cause sodium and water re- tention. Phosphate enemas are useful for rapid bowel evacuation prior to proce- dures. If these don’t help Prucalopride is an elective 5HT4 agonist with prokinetic prop- erties; Lubiprostone is a chloride-channel activator that increases intestinal fl uid secretion; Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase-C agonist that also increases fl uid se- cretion and decreases visceral pain. A multidisciplinary approach with behaviour therapy, habit training ± sphincter biofeedback may help. 15 Rectocele: front wall of the rectum
