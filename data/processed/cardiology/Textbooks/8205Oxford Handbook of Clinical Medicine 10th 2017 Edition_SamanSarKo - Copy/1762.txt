factors, includ- ing for 2° osteoporosis. Investigations X-ray (low sensitivity/specifi city, often with hindsight after a fracture). Bone densitometry (DEXA—see BOX ‘DEXA bone densitometry’; table 14.5). Bloods: Ca2+, PO43Ω, and ALP normal. Consider specifi c investigations for 2° causes if suggestive history. Biopsy is unreliable and unnecessary with non-invasive tech- niques available. Management Loss of bone mineral density may not be entirely irreversible. Age, number of risk factors, and bone mineral density (DEXA scan; see BOX ‘DEXA bone den- sitometry’) guide the pharmacological approach (eg FRAX, which is a WHO risk assess- ment tool for estimating 10-yr risk of osteoporotic fracture in untreated patients; see www.shef.ac.uk/frax),13,14 although DEXA is not necessary if age >75yrs. Lifestyle measures should apply to all (including those at risk but not yet osteoporotic). Lifestyle measures: • Quit smoking and reduce alcohol consumption. • Weight-bearing exercise may increase bone mineral density.15 • Balance exercises such as tai chi reduce risk of falls. • Calcium and vitamin D-rich diet (use supplements if diet is insuffi cient—see ‘Phar- macological measures’ later in this topic). • Home-based fall-prevention programme, with visual assessment and a home visit. NB: hip-protectors are unreliable for preventing fractures.16 Pharmacological measures: • Bisphosphonates: alendronic acid
