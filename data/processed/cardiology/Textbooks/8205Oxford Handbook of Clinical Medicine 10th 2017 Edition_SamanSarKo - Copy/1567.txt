~30% over-express HER2 (growth factor receptor gene) associated with aggressive disease and poorer prognosis. Investigations (See p82 for history and examination.) All lumps should undergo ‘triple’ assessment: Clinical examination + histology/cytology + mammography/ul- trasound; see fi g 13.24. Staging: Stage 1: Confi ned to breast, mobile. Stage 2: Growth confi ned to breast, mobile, lymph nodes in ipsilateral axilla. Stage 3: Tumour fi xed to muscle (but not chest wall), ipsilateral lymph nodes matted and may be fi xed, skin involvement larger than tumour. Stage 4: Complete fi xation of tumour to chest wall, distant metasta- ses. Also TNM staging: (p523) T1<2cm, T2, 2–5cm, T3 >5cm, T4, fi xity to chest wall or peau d’orange; N1, mobile ipsilateral nodes; N2, fi xed nodes; M1, distant metastases. Treating local disease (Stage 1–2.)7 •Surgery: Removal of tumour by wide local excision (WLE) or mastectomy ± breast reconstruction + axillary node sampling/ surgical clearance or sentinel node biopsy (BOX ‘Sentinel node biopsy’). •Radio- therapy: Recommended for all patients with invasive cancer after WLE. Risk of recurrence decreases from 30% to <10% at 10yrs and increases overall survival. Axillary radiotherapy used if lymph node +ve on sampling and surgical clearance not performed (risk of
