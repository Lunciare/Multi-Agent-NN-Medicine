(if seen with painless jaundice the cause is not gallstones—Courvoisier’s ‘law’).24 Pale stools + dark urine ≈ cholestatic jaundice. Tests See p276 for screening tests in suspected liver disease. Urine: Bilirubin is absent in pre-hepatic causes; in obstructive jaundice, urobilinogen is absent. Hae- matology: FBC, clotting, fi lm, reticulocyte count, Coombs’ test and haptoglobins for haemolysis (p336), malaria parasites (eg if unconjugated bilirubin/fever); Paul Bunnell (EBV). Chemistry: U&E, LFT, -GT, total protein, albumin.25 Paracetamol lev- els. Microbiology: Blood and other cultures; hepatitis serology. Ultrasound: Are the bile ducts dilated? Are there gallstones, hepatic metastases, or a pancreatic mass? ERCP: (See p742.) If bile ducts are dilated and LFT not improving. MRCP: (See p742.) Or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) if conventional ultrasound shows gallstones but no defi nite com mon bile duct stones. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) If bile ducts are normal. Consider abdominal CT/MRI if abdominal malignancy is suspected. What to do? Treat the cause promptly. Ensure adequate hydration; broad-spec- trum antibiotics if obstruction. Monitor for ascites, encephalopathy; call a hepatologist. 23 Multiple segmental cystic or saccular dilatations of intrahepatic bile ducts with congenital hepatic fi brosis. It may present in 20yr-olds, with portal hypertension ± recurrent cholangitis/cholelithiasis. 24 Pancreatic or
