ache, more frontal than occipi- tal. The most characteristic symptom is of positional exacerbation—worse when upright. There may be mild meningism or nausea. The pathology is thought to be continued leakage of CSF from the puncture site and intracranial hypotension, though there may be other mechanisms involved. Prevention Use the smallest spinal needle that is practical (22G) and keep the bevel aligned as described on p768. Blunt needles (more expensive) can reduce risk and are recommended (ask an anaesthetist about supply); however, collection of CSF takes too long (>6min) if needles smaller than 22G are used. Before withdraw- ing the needle, reinsert the stilette. Treatment Despite years of anecdotal advice to the contrary, none of the follow- ing has ever been shown to be a risk factor: position during or after the procedure; hydration status before, during, or after; amount of CSF removed; immediate activ- ity or rest post-LP. Time is a consistent healer. For severe or prolonged headaches, ask an anaesthetist about a blood patch. This is a careful injection of 20mL of autologous venous blood into the adjacent epidural space (said to ‘clog up the hole’). Immediate relief occurs in 95%. Fig 18.8 Defi ning the 3rd–4th lumbar
