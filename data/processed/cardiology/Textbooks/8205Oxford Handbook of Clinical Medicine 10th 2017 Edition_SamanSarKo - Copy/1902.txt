cellular integrity for uptake. Newer technetium-99 (99Tc)-based agents are similar to 201Tl but have improved imaging characteristics, and can be used to assess myocardial perfusion and LV performance in the same study (fi g 16.30). Myocardial territories supplied by unobstructed coronary vessels have normal per- fusion whereas regions supplied by stenosed coronary vessels have poorer relative perfusion, a diff erence that is accentuated by exercise. For this reason, exercise tests are used in conjunction with radionuclide imaging to identify areas at risk of ischae- mia/infarction. Exercise scans are compared with resting views: reversible (ischae- mia) or fi xed defects (infarct) can be seen and the coronary artery involved reliably predicted. Drugs (eg adenosine, dobutamine, and dipyridamole) can also be used to induce perfusion diff erences between normal and underperfused tissues. Myocardial perfusion imaging adds information in patients presenting with acute MI (to determine the amount of myocardium salvaged by thrombolysis) and in diag- nosing acute chest pain in those without classical ECG changes (to defi ne the pres- ence of signifi cant perfusion defects).
