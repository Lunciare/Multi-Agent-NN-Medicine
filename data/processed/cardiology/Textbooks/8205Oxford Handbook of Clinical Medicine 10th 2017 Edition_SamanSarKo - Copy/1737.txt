670 Acid–base balance Arterial blood pH is closely regulated in health to 7.40 ± 0.05 by various mechanisms including bicarbonate, other plasma buff ers such as deoxygenated haemoglobin, and the kidney. Acid–base disorders needlessly confuse many people, but if a few simple rules are applied, then interpretation and diagnosis are easy. The key principle is that primary changes in HCO3Ω are metabolic and in CO2 respiratory. See fi g 14.2. A simple method 1 Look at the pH, is there an acidosis or alkalosis? • pH <7.35 is an acidosis; pH >7.45 is an alkalosis. 2 Is the CO abnormal? (Normal range 4.7–6.0kPa.) 2 If so, is the change in keeping with the pH? • CO2 is an acidic gas—is CO2 raised with an acidosis, lowered with an alkalosis? If so, it is in keeping with the pH and thus caused by a respiratory problem. If there is no change, or an opposite one, then the change is compensatory. 3 Is the HCOΩ abnormal? (Normal concentration 22–28mmol/L.) 3 If so, is the change in keeping with the pH? • HCO3Ω is alkaline—is HCO3Ω raised with an alkalosis, lowered with an acidosis? If so, the problem is a metabolic one. 4
