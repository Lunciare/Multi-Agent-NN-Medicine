1 Can you get above it? 2 Is it separate from the testis? 3 Cystic or solid? • Cannot get above: inguinoscrotal hernia (p614) or hydrocele extending proximally. • Separate and cystic: epididymal cyst. • Separate and solid: epididymitis/varicocele. • Testicular and cystic: hydrocele. Testicular and solid—tumour, haem atocele, granuloma (p196), orchitis, gumma (p412). US may help. Epididymal cysts Usually develop in adulthood and contain clear or milky (sperm- atocele) fl uid. They lie above and behind the testis. Remove if symptomatic. Hydroceles (Fluid within the tunica vaginalis.) Primary (associated with a patent processus vaginalis, which typically resolves during the 1st year of life) or seconda ry to testis tumour/trauma/infection. Primary hydro celes are more common, larger, and usually in younger men. Can resolve spontaneously. : Aspira tion (may need repeating) or surgery: plicating the tunica vaginalis (Lord’s repair)/inverting the sac (Jaboulay’s repair). Is the testis normal after aspiration? If any doubt, do US. Epididymo-orchitis Causes:Chlamydia(eg if<35yrs);E. coli; mumps;N. gonorrh- oeae; TB. Features: Sudden-onset tender swelling, dysuria, sweats/fever. Take ‘1st catch’ urine sample; look for urethral discharge. Consider STI screen. Warn of possi- ble infertility and symptoms worsening before improving. : If <35yrs; doxycycline 100mg/12h (covers chlamydia;treat sexual partn ers).
