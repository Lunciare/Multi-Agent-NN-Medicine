May be due to unilateral lesion, eye-drops, eye surgery, syphilis, or Holmes–Adie pupil. Some inequality is normal. Light reaction: Test: cover one eye and shine light into the other obliquely. Both pupils should constrict, one by direct, other by consensual light refl ex (fi g 2.33). The lesion site is deduced by knowing the pathway: from the retina the message passes up the optic nerve (CNII) to the superior colliculus (midbrain) and thence to the CNIII nuclei on both sides. The IIIrd cranial nerve causes pupillary constriction. If a light in one eye causes only contralateral constriction, the defect is ‘eff erent’, as the aff erent pathways from the retina being stimulated must be intact. Test for relative afferent pupillary defect: move torch quickly from pupil to pupil. If there has been incomplete damage to the aff erent pathway, the aff ected pupil will paradoxically dilate when light is moved from the normal eye to the abnormal eye. This is because, in the face of reduced aff erent input from the aff ected eye, the consensual pupillary relaxation response from the normal eye predominates. This is the Marcus Gunn sign, and may occur after apparent complete recovery from the initial
