side. Tactile vocal fremitus and vocal resonance are  (incon- stant and unreliable). Above the eff usion, where lung is compressed, there may be bronchial breathing. With large eff usions there may be tracheal deviation away from the eff usion. Look for aspiration marks and signs of associated disease: ma- lignancy (cachexia, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, radiation marks, mastectomy scar); stigmata of chronic liver disease; cardiac failure; hypothyroidism; rheumatoid arthri- tis; butterfl y rash of SLE. Tests CXR: Small eff usions blunt the costophrenic angles, larger ones are seen as water-dense shadows with concave upper borders. A completely fl at horizontal up- per border implies that there is also a pneumothorax. Ultrasound is useful in identifying the presence of pleural fl uid and in guiding diag- nostic or therapeutic aspiration. Diagnostic aspiration: Percuss the upper border of the pleural eff usion and choose a site 1 or 2 intercostal spaces below it (don’t go too low or you’ll be in the abdo- men!). Infi ltrate down to the pleura with 5–10mL of 1% lidocaine. Attach a 21G needle to a syringe and insert it just above the upper border of an appropriate rib (avoids neurovascular bundle). Draw off 10–30mL of pleural fl
