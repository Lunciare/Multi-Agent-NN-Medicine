antibiotic use has led to the development of highly virulent, multiple resistant E. coli and Klebsiella species including: • extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae. Resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, fl uoroquinolones, trimethoprim, tetracycline, with pos- sible extension to other antibiotic groups • carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Resistance requires antimicrobial stewardship (p384), surveillance, robust infection control, research into resistance risk and transmission (p383). Pseudomonas aeruginosa: Found in environment. Spread by contact/ingestion. Presentation: important cause of nosocomial infection. Infection if compromised tissue, eg wound, pneumonia with lung disease or ventilation, UTI with catheterization. Septicaemia if immuno- suppressed. Treatment: options include ceftazidime/carbapenem, aminoglycoside, colistin. Combination may be needed. Impermeability of membrane and biofi lm colo- nization lead to antibiotic resistance. Multidrug-resistance. Seek expert help. Haemophilus infl uenzae: Divided into encapsulated, typeable forms (a-f); and unencapsulated, non-typeable forms. Upper respiratory tract carriage, transmitted by droplets. H. infl uenzae b (Hib) causes meningitis, epiglottitis, otitis media, pneumonia, cellulitis, septic ar- thritis, and bacteraemia. Fatal in ~5%. Routine immunization in childhood and sple- nectomy/hyposplenism (p407). Non-typeable forms cause pneumonia and sinusitis. Treatment: amoxicillin, macrolide, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol, rifampicin. Whooping cough: Bordetella pertussis. Presentation: catarrhal phase 1–2wk, then paroxysmal cough- ing. ‘Whoop’ is a breath through partially closed vocal cords,
