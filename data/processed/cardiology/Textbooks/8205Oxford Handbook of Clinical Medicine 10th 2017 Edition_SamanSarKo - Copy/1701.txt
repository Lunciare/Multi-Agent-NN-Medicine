PAD, sudden deterioration of symptoms with deep duskiness of the limb may indicate acute arterial occlusion. This ap- pearance is due to extensive pre–existing collaterals and must not be misdiag- nosed as gout/cellulitis. • Management: This is an emergency and may require urgent open surgery or angioplasty. If diagnosis is in doubt, do urgent arteriography. If the occlusion is embolic, the options are surgical embolectomy (Fogarty catheter) or local thrombolysis, eg tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA, p345), balancing the risks of surgery with the haemorrhagic complications of thrombolysis. • Anticoagulate with heparin after either procedure and look for the source of emboli. Be aware of possible post-op reperfusion injury and subsequent com- partment syndrome. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 665577 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 658 Varicose veins (VVS) Long, tortuous, & dilated veins of the superfi cial venous system (see fi g 13.55). Pathology Blood from superfi cial veins of the leg passes into deep veins via perfora- tor veins (perforate deep fascia) and at the saphenofemoral and saphenopopliteal junctions. Valves prevent blood from passing from deep to superfi cial veins. If they become incompetent there is venous hypertension and dilata tion of the superfi cial veins occurs.
