disease (vit D); neurological features, eg neuropathy. Tests FBC ( or MCV); Ca2+; Fe; B12 + folate; INR; lipid profi le; coeliac tests (see ‘Coeliac disease’). Stool: Sudan stain for fat globules; stool microscopy (infestation); elastase. Breath hydrogen analysis: For bacterial overgrowth.20 Take samples of end- expired air; give glucose; take more samples at ½h intervals; early exhaled hydrogen = overgrowth. Endoscopy + small bowel biopsy. Infectious malabsorption Giardia, Cryptosporidium, Isospora belli, Cyclospora cayetanensis, microsporidia. Tropical sprue: Villous atrophy + malabsorption occur- ring in the Far and Middle East and Caribbean—the cause is unknown. Tetracycline 250mg/6h PO + folic acid 5mg/d PO for 3–6mnths may help. Coeliac disease Suspect this if diarrhoea + weight loss or anaemia (esp. if iron or B12 ). T-cell- responses to gluten (alcohol-soluble proteins in wheat, barley, rye ± oats) in the small bowel causes villous atrophy and malabsorption. Associations HLA DQ2 in 95%; the rest are DQ8; autoimmune disease; dermatitis herpetiformis. Prevalence 1 in 100–300 (commoner if Irish). Any age (peaks in childhood and 50–60yrs). : >1:1. Relative risk in 1st-degree relatives is 6≈. Presentation Stinking stools/steatorrhoea; diarrhoea; abdominal pain; bloating; nau- sea + vomiting; aphthous ulcers; angular stomatitis (p327, fi g 8.5); weight;
