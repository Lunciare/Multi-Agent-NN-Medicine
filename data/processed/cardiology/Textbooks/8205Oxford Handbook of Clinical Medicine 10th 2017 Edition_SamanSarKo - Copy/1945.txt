Some drugs cannot be passed this way (eg amiodarone, K+).  The external jugular vein may become prominent when the patient is head down (Trendelenburg) by 5–10° (not in situations of fl uid overload, LVF, ICP). Only at- tempt cannulation of this vein if you are not going to jeopardize future central line insertion, and if you can clearly determine the surrounding anatomy.  In an arrest situation, the 2015 Advanced Life Support Guidelines recommend the intraosseous route in both adults and children if venous access is not pos- sible; access devices should be available within resuscitation settings (eg emer- gency department).
