ventricular strain pattern V1–V3 (p98), right axis deviation, RBBB, AF, may be deep S waves in I, Q waves in III, in- verted T waves in III (‘SI QIII TIII’). • CXR: often normal; decreased vascular markings, small pleural eff usion. Wedge- shaped area of infarction. Atelectasis. • ABG: hyperventilation + poor gas exchange: PaO2, PaCO2, pH. • Serum D-dimer: low specifi city ( if thrombosis, infl ammation, post-op, infection, malignancy)  check only in patients with low pre-test probability (p191). • CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is sensitive and specifi c and is the test of choice for high-risk patients or low-risk patients with a +ve D-dimer. If unavaila- ble, a ventilation–perfusion (V/Q) scan can aid diagnosis but frequently produces equivocal results Management See fi g 19.16 for immediate management.11 If good story and signs, make the diagnosis. Start treatment (fi g 19.16) before defi nitive investigations: most PE deaths occur within 1h. • Commence LMWH or fondaparinux. • If there is haemodynamic instability, consider thromolysis. • Long-term anticoagulation: either DOAC (p350—switch directly from LMWH) or warfarin (continue LMWH until INR >2). • Is there an underlying cause, eg thrombophilia (p374), SLE, or polycythaemia? Con- sider malignancy (take a careful
