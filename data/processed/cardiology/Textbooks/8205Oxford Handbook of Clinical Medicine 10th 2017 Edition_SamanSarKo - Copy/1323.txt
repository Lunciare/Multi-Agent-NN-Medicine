fi bres on histology. The commonest is myo- tonic dystrophy which is, in fact, clinically and genetically heterogeneous, with two major forms (DM1 and DM2—see table 10.12), both showing abnormal trinucleotide repeat expansions in regulatory (non-coding) genetic regions. DM1 is the commoner, more severe, and typically presents between 20–40 yrs old with distal weakness (hand/foot drop), weak sternomastoids, and myotonia. Facial weakness and muscle wasting give a long, haggard appearance. Also: cataracts, male frontal baldness, diabetes, testis/ovary atrophy, cardiomyopathy, and cognition. Most DM1 patients die in late middle age of respiratory or cardiac complications. Mexiletine may help with disabling myotonia. Genetic counselling is important. Infl ammatory myopathies There may be spontaneous muscle pain at rest and local tenderness on palpation. Inclusion body myositis is the chief example if aged >50yrs. Weakness starts with quadriceps, fi nger fl exors, or pharyngeal muscles. Ventral extremity muscle groups are more aff ected than dorsal or girdle groups. Response to therapy is poor and patients typically progress over a decade to require assistance with activites of daily living. Histology shows ringed vacuoles + intranuclear inclusions. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis, see p552. Metabolic myopathies Eg McArdle’s disease (glycogen storage disorder). Pre- sents with muscle pain and
