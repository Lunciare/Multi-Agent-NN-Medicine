There are four classes: chylomicrons and VLDL (mainly triglyceride), LDL (mainly cholesterol), and HDL (mainly phosphol ipid) (for abbreviations see footnote3). The evidence that cholesterol is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is undisputed (‘4S’ STUDY, 21 WOSCOPS, 22 CARE STUDY, 23 HEART PROTECTION STUDY 24) and indeed it may even be the ‘green light’ that allows other risk factors to act. 25 Half the UK population have a serum cholesterol putting them at signifi cant risk of CVD. HDL appears to correlate inversely with CVD. Who to screen for hyperlipidaemia NB: full screening requires a fasting lipid profi le. Those at risk of hyperlipidaemia: •Family history of hyperlipidaemia. •Corneal ar- cus <50yrs old. •Xanthomata or xanthelasmata (fi g
