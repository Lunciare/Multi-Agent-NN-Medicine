prognosis. Tests To confi rm diagnosis: ABPM or home BP monitoring. To help quantify overall risk: Fasting glucose; cholesterol. To look for end-organ damage: ECG or echo (any LV hypertrophy? past MI?); urine analysis (protein, blood). To ‘exclude’ secondary causes: U&E (eg K+ in Conn’s); Ca2+ ( in hyperparathyroidism). Special tests: Re- nal ultrasound/arteriography (renal artery stenosis); 24h urinary meta-adrenaline (p228); urinary free cortisol (p225); renin; aldosterone; MR aorta (coarctation). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 113388 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC Grading hypertensive retinopathy 139 1 Tortuous arteries with thick shiny walls (silver or copper wiring, p560, fi g 12.18). 2 AV nipping (narrowing where arteries cross veins, p560, fi g 12.19). 3 Flame haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots. 4 Papilloedema, p560, fi g 12.20. Measuring BP with a sphygmomanometer • Use the correct size cuff . The cuff width should be >40% of the arm circum- ference. The bladder should be centred over the brachial artery, and the cuff applied snugly. Support the arm in a horizontal position at mid-sternal level. • Infl ate the cuff while palpating the brachial artery, until the pulse disappears. This provides an estimate of systolic pressure. • Infl ate the cuff until 30mmHg above systolic pressure, then place stethoscope
