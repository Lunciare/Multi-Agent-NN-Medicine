Enzyme immunoassay: antigen detection as adjunct to microscopy, antibody detection in extra-intestinal disease. PCR can distinguish E. histolytica from morpho- logically identical but non-invasive E. dispar. Treatment: Metronidazole/tinidazole for amoebic dysentery and invasive disease. Diloxanide furoate: luminal agent, 10d course to destroy gut cysts, given in asymptomatic gut carriers and symptomatic dis- ease, in addition to other treatment. Abscess may require (image-guided) drainage. Cyclospora Coccidean protozoan Cyclospora cayetanensis. ~50 imported cases/yr in UK. Presentation: Flu-like prodrome, watery diar- rhoea, weight loss, marked fatigue, low-grade fever in ~25%. Self-limiting after 7–9wks in immunocompetent. Diagnosis: Autofl uorescent oocytes in stool (appear blue-green under UV fl uorescence fi g 9.41), PCR. Treatment: Co-trimoxazole.
