within 7d of symptom onset, is now the treatment of choice. Early surgery reduces the duration of hospital admission compared with delayed surgery, but does not reduce mortality or complications. Up to one-quarter of people scheduled for delayed surgery may require urgent operations because of recurrent or worsening symptoms.10 For biliary colic Patients with biliary colic due to gallstones waiting for an elec- tive laparoscopic cholecystectomy may develop signifi cant complications, such as acute pancreatitis (p636) during the waiting period. One high-bias trial found early laparoscopic cholecystectomy (within 24h of an acute episode) decreased potential complications that may develop during the wait for elective surgery. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 663355 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 636 Acute pancreatitis This unpredictable disease (mortality ~12%) is characterized by self-perpetuating pancreatic enzyme-mediated autodigestion; oedema and fl uid shifts cause hypovol- aemia, as extracellular fl uid is trapped in the gut, peritoneum, and retroperitoneum (worsened by vomiting). Although pancreatitis is mild in 80% of cases; 20% develop severe complicated and life-threatening disease: progression may be rapid from mild oedema to necrotizing pancreatitis. ~50% of cases that advance to necrosis are fur- ther complicated by infection.
