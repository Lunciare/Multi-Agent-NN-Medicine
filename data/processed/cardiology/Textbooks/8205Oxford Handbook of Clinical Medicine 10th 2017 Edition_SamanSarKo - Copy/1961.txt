seek help. • If any cause for concern, arrange a repeat CXR.

This technique is also used for pneumathoraces (except in traumatic or post-operative situations) without US guidance; for this reason it is detailed here. Sterile procedure • Identify the point for drainage. In eff usions, this should be done with US, ideally under direct guidance or with a marked spot. For pneumothoraces, check the drainage point from CXR/CT/examination. • Preparation: trolley with dressing pack; 2% chlorhexidine; needles; 10mL syring- es; 1% lidocaine; scalpel; suture; Seldinger chest drain kit; underwater drainage bottle; connection tubes; sterile H2O; dressings. Incontinence pad under patient. • Choose insertion site: 4–6th intercostal space, anterior- to mid-axillary
