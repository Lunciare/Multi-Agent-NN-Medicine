all healthcare- associated infection. ~50% of UTIS are associated with a urethral catheter. Risk of infection is related to method of catheter insertion, duration of catheter, quality of catheter care, and patient susceptibility. To reduce risk, only catheterize if necessary: Is there obstruction? Do you need precise urine output monitoring? Remove as soon as possible. See UTI pp296–7. Infections associated with the use of intravascular access devices: Includes peripheral, central venous, and arterial catheters: tunnelled and non- tunnelled. >60% of bloodstream infections are associated with intravascular de- vices. Risk is higher with central catheters. Infection can result from introduc- tion of microbes during insertion, access (eg when giving IV antibiotics), or from microbes elsewhere in the body seeding to the foreign material. Organisms include Staphylococcus epidermidis (p388), Staphylococcus aureus (including meticillin- resistant forms  MRSA see p388), Candida species (p408), and enterococci (p389). Ensure that vascular access devices are used only when clinically indicated. Switch to oral treatment (fl uid, medication, nutrition) as soon as clinically ap- propriate. Treatment includes removal/exchange of the device whenever possible. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): VAP aff ects up to 20% of patients admitted to intensive care units. Occurs as the endotracheal tube interferes with protective
