failure (see fi g 3.38); a globular heart may indicate pericardial eff usion (fi g 3.14); metal wires and valves will show up, evidencing previous cardiothoracic surgery; dextrocardia may explain a bizarre ECG; and rib notching may be an important clue in coarctation of the aorta (p156). Echocardiography This is the workhorse of cardiological imaging. Ultrasound is used to give real-time images of the moving heart. This can be transthoracic (TTE) or transoesophageal (TOE), at rest, during exercise, or after infusion of a pharmaco- logical stressor (eg dobutamine). If the patient is too unwell to be moved, an echo machine can be brought to them and continuous TOE imaging may be used as a guide during surgery. Increasingly pocket-sized echo machines are used for a quick assess- ment of an unwell patient, to be followed by a formal scan later. See p110. Cardiac CT This can provide detailed information about cardiac structure and func- tion. CT angiography (fi g 3.15) permits contrast-enhanced imaging of coronary ar- teries during a single breath hold with very low radiation doses. It can diagnose signifi cant (>50%) stenosis in coronary artery disease with an accuracy of 89%. CT coronary angiography has a negative predictive
