and may not always be accompanied by anae- mia (eg in alcohol excess). Causes of macrocytosis (MCV >96fL) • Megaloblastic: (fi g 8.25) a megaloblast is a cell in which nuclear maturation is delayed compared with the cytoplasm. This occurs with B12 (p334) and folate de- fi ciency: both are required for DNA synthesis. Another cause is cytotoxic drugs. • Non-megaloblastic: Alcohol excess, reticulocytosis (eg in haemolysis), liver dis- ease, hypothyroidism, pregnancy. • Other haematological disease: Myelodysplasia (fi g 8.26), myeloma, myeloprolif- erative disorders, aplastic anaemia. Tests B12 and folate defi ciency result in similar blood fi lm and bone marrow biopsy appearances. Blood fi lm: Hypersegmented neutrophils (fi g 8.25) in B12 and folate defi ciency. Target cells if liver disease; see fi g 8.14, p329 and fi g 8.41, p343. Other tests: LFT (include GT), TFT, serum B12, and serum folate (or red cell folate—a more reliable indicator of folate status, as serum folate only refl ects recent intake). Bone marrow biopsy is indicated if the cause is not revealed by the above tests. It is likely to show one of the following four states: 1 Megaloblastic marrow. 2 Normoblastic marrow (eg in liver disease, hypothyroidism). 3 Abnormal
