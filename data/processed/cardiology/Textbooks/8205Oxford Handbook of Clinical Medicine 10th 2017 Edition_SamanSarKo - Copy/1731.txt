ANP, BNP, and CNP (p137) contribute to Na+ homeostasis by reducing Na+ reabsorption from the DCT and inhibiting renin. A high GFR (see later in this topic) results in increased Na+ loss, and high renal tubular fl ow and haemodilu- tion decrease Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Control of potassium Most K+ is intracellular, and thus serum K+ levels are a poor refl ection of total body potassium. The concentrations of K+ and H+ in extracellular fl uid tend to vary together. This is because these ions compete with each other in the exchange with Na+ that occurs across most cell membranes and in the distal con- voluted tubule of the kidney, where Na+ is reabsorbed from the urine. Thus, if the H+ concentration is high, less K+ will be excreted into the urine. Similarly, K+ will compete with H+ for exchange across cell membranes and extracellular K+ will accumulate. Insulin and catecholamines both stimulate K+ uptake into cells by stimulating the Na+/K+ pump. Serum osmolality A laboratory measurement of the number of osmoles per kilo- gram of solvent. It is approximated by serum osmolarity (the number of osmoles per litre of solution) using the equation 2(Na+ + K+)
