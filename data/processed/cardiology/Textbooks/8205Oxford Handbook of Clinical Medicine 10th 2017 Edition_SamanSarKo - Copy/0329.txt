• Triple-vessel disease involving proximal part of the left anterior descending. Indications for CABG—to relieve symptoms: • Angina unresponsive to drugs. • Unstable angina (sometimes). • If angioplasty is unsuccessful. NB: when CABG and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, eg angioplasty) are both clinically valid options, NICE recommends that the availability of new stent technology should push the decision towards PCI. In practice, patients with single- vessel coronary artery disease and normal LV function usually undergo PCI, and those with triple-vessel disease and abnormal LV function more often undergo CABG. Compared with PCI, CABG results in longer recovery time and length of inpatient stay. Recent RCTs indicate that early procedural mortality rates and 5-year survival rates are similar after PCI and CABG. Compared with PCI, CABG probably provides more complete long-term relief of angina in patients, and less repeated revascu- larization. Procedure: The heart is usually stopped and blood pumped artifi cially by a ma- chine outside the body (cardiac bypass). Minimally invasive thoracotomies not requiring this are well described, 21 but randomized trials are few. The patient’s own saphenous vein or internal mammary artery is used as the graft. Several grafts may be placed. >50% of vein grafts close in
