seicnegremE 804 Broad complex tachycardia ECG shows rate of >100bpm and QRS complexes >120ms (>3 small squares on ECGS done at the standard UK rate of 25mm/s). Identify the underlying rhythm and treat accordingly.6 Diff erential diagnosis (See p128.) • Ventricular tachycardia (VT) including torsade de pointes. Single ventricular ectopics should not cause confusion; if >3 together at a rate >100, this is VT. • SVT (p806) with aberrant conduction, eg AF or atrial fl utter, with bundle branch block. • Pre-excited tachycardias, eg AF, atrial fl utter, or AV re-entry tachycardia, with un- derlying WPW (p133). Identifying the underlying rhythm (See p128.) If in doubt, treat as VT. Management See fi g 19.9.6 • Connect patient to a cardiac monitor and have a defi brillator to hand. • Monitor O2 sats and if <90% give supplemental oxygen. • Correct electrolyte abnormalities, esp K+ and Mg2+. • Check for adverse signs. Low cardiac output (clammy, consciousness, BP <90); oliguria; angina; pulmonary oedema. • Obtain 12-lead ECG (request CXR) and obtain IV access. If haemodynamically unstable VT: Synchronized DC shock (see p894, fi g A3). • Correct any hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia: up to 60mmol KCl at 30mmol/h, and 4mL 50% magnesium
