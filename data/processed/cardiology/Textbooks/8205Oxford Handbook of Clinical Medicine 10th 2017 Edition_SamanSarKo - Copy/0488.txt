fraction of O2 (FiO2) at high fl ow rates. Start at 24–28% in COPD. Colours of masks: BLUE = 24%, WHITE = 28%, YELLOW = 35%, RED = 40%, GREEN = 60%. Non-rebreathing mask: These have a reservoir bag and deliver high concentra- tions of O2 (60–90%), determined by the infl ow (10–15L/min) and the presence of fl ap valves on the side. They are commonly used in emergencies, but are imprecise and should be avoided in those requiring controlled O2 therapy. Promoting oxygenation: Other ways to  oxygenation to reach the target SaO2 (this should be given as a number on the drug chart): • Treat anaemia (transfuse if essential). • Improve cardiac output (treat heart failure). • Chest physio to improve ventilation/perfusion mismatch. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 118899 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem tsehC 190 Pulmonary embolism (PE) Causes PES usually arise from a venous thrombosis in the pelvis or legs. Clots break off and pass through the veins and the right side of the heart before lodging in the pulmonary circulation. Rare causes: RV thrombus (post-MI); septic emboli (right- sided endocarditis); fat, air, or amniotic fl uid embolism; neoplastic cells; parasites. Risk factors • Recent surgery, especially abdominal/pelvic or hip/knee replacement. •
