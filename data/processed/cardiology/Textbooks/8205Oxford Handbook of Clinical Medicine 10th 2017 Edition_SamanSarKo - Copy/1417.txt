one isn’t eff ective, try another. Mainly act as analgesics rather than modifying the disease process per se. NSAIDs caused ~2000 UK deaths in 2011.13 Individualized risk: benefi t analysis for each patient (including indication, dose, proposed duration of use, and comorbid- ity) is crucial and needs careful and experienced thought. Follow local recommen- dations and national guidelines where available. NSAID side effects: The main serious side eff ects are GI bleeding (and ulcers and perforation), cardiovascular events (MI and stroke), and renal injury. The risks are dose related, starting with the fi rst dose, so always aim to use the lowest possible dose for the shortest period of time. Risks increase considerably with age, polyp- harmacy, history of peptic ulcers, and renal impairment. GI side effects: NICE recommends co-prescription of PPI for any patient aged >45 years, and those with other risk factors for GI bleeding. Drug interactions can increase bleeding risks—avoid concomitant prescribing of anticoagulants, anti- platelet agents, SSRI, spironolactone, steroids, and bisphosphonates. Coxibs are slightly lower risk than non-selective NSAIDs. Cardiovascular side effects: NSAIDS—all are associated with a small increased risk of MI and stroke (independent of cardiovascular risk factor or duration of use).14 Risks are higher
