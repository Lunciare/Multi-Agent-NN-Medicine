Anuria is defi ned as <50mL/24h. In a catheterized patient with sudden anuria consider catheter blockage, with slow decline of oliguria to anuria renal dysfunction is more likely. Polyuria Increased urine volume, eg >3L/24h. Causes: Over-enthusiastic IV fl uid therapy; diabe- tes mellitus & insipidus (diabetes is Greek for fountain);Ca2+; psycho genic polydipsia/ PIP syndrome (p240); polyuric phase of recovering acute tubular necrosis.
