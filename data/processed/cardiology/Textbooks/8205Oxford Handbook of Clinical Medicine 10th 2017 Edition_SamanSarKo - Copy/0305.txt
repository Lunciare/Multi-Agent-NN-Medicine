seem to alter their clinical effi cacy. Uses: Angina, hypertension, antid ysrhythmic, post MI (mortality), heart failure (with caution). CI: Severe asthma/COPD, heart block. SES: Lethargy, erectile dysfunction, joie de vivre, nightmares, headache. ACE inhibitors These are used in hypertension (HT), heart failure, and post-MI. First dose HT is a concern in patients with severe CCF and malignant HT. In CCF patients, reduce diuretic dose initially and use long-acting ACE-i. Monitor U&E when starting or raising ACE-i dose, a creatinine rise of >20% is concerning. If the patient starts ACE-i prior to discharge, ask the GP to check U&E in 1–2 weeks. If renal function deteriorates markedly, consider investigating for renal artery stenosis. The risk to the kidneys is greater when the patient is unwell. Hold in AKI and hyperkalaemia; avoid starting if the patient is dehydrated. SES: Include dry cough and urticaria. Diuretics • Loop diuretics (eg furosemide) are used in heart failure, and inhibit the Na/2Cl/K co-transporter. SES: dehydration, Na+,K+, Ca2+, ototoxic • Thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics are used in hypertension (eg indapamide) and heart failure (eg metolazone). SE: K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, urate (±gout), impotence (NB: small doses, eg chlortalidone 25mg/24h rarely cause signifi cant SEs) • Potassium-sparing
