not revealed by the above tests. It is likely to show one of the following four states: 1 Megaloblastic marrow. 2 Normoblastic marrow (eg in liver disease, hypothyroidism). 3 Abnormal erythropoiesis (eg sideroblastic anaemia, p326, leukaemia, aplasia). 4 Increased erythropoiesis (eg haemolysis). Folate Found in green vegetables, nuts, yeast, and liver; it is synthesized by gut bacte ria. Body stores can last for 4 months. Maternal folate defi ciency causes fe- tal neural tube defects. It is absorbed by duodenum/proximal jejunum. Causes of defi ciency: • Poor diet, eg poverty, alcoholics, elderly. • Increased demand, eg pregnancy or cell turnover (seen in haemolysis, malig- nancy, infl ammatory disease, and renal dialysis). • Malabsorption, eg coeliac disease, tropical sprue. • Alcohol. • Drugs: anti-epileptics (phenytoin, valproate), methotrexate, trimethoprim. Treatment: Assess for an underlying cause, eg poor diet, malabsorption. Treat with folic acid 5mg/day PO for 4 months, never without B12 unless the patient is known to have a normal B12 level, as in low B12 states it may precipitate, or worsen, subacute combined degeneration of the cord (p334). In pregnancy, prophy lactic doses of folate (400mcg/day) are given from conception until at least 12wks; this helps prevent spina bifi da, as
