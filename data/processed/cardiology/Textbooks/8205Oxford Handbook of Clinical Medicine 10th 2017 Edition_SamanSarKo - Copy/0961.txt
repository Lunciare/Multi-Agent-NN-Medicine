myeloma and amyloidosis have a shorter survival than those with myeloma alone. 9 Electrophoresis and plasmapheresis look as though they should share endings, but they do not: Greek phoros = bearing (esis = process), but aphairesis is Greek for removal. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 337700 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 371 Fig 8.74 Periorbital purpura in amyloidosis. ©Prof. Christine Lawrence.

It meas- ures how far RBCS fall through a column of anticoagulated blood in 1h. If certain proteins cover red cells, these cause RBCS to stick to each other in columns (the same phenomenon as rouleaux, p328) so they fall faster. Causes of a raised ESR Any infl ammation (eg infection, rheumatoid arthritis, ma- lignancy, myocardial infarction), anaemia, and macrocytosis. Caveats •ESR  with age. The Westergren method is a rough guide to calculate the upper limit of normal in older patients: : ESR=age ÷ 2; : ESR=(age + 10)
