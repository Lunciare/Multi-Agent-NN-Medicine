atox- in; Clonorchis sinensis; anabolic steroids. : 3-phase CT (delayed wash-out of contrast in a suspect mass); MRI; biopsy. Treatment: Resecting solitary tumours <3cm across  3yr survival from 13% to 59%; but ~50% have recurrence by 3yrs.36 Liver transplant gives a 5yr survival rate of 70%.37 Percutaneous ablation, tumour embolization (TACE38), and sorafenib are options. Prevention: HBV vaccination (BOX and table 6.15). Don’t reuse needles. Screen blood. Afl atox in exposure (sun-dry maize). AFP ± ultrasound (eg 6-monthly screen): Consider if at  risk: eg all with cirrhosis; or chronic HBV in Africans or older Asians. Cholangiocarcinoma (Biliary tree cancer.) ~10% of liver primaries. Causes: Flukes (Clonorchis, p435); PSC (screening by CA19–9 may be helpful, p282); biliary cysts; Caro- li’s disease, p272; HBV; HCV; DM; N-nitroso toxins. The patient: Fever, abdominal pain (± ascites), malaise, bilirubin; ALP. Pathology: Usually slow-growing. Most are distal extrahepatic or perihilar. Management: 70% inoperable at presentation. Of those that are, 76% recur. Surgery: eg major hepatectomy + extrahepatic bile duct excision + caudate lobe rese c tion. 5yr survival ~30%. Post-op complications include liver failure, bile leak, and GI bleeding. Stenting of obstructed extrahepatic biliary tree, percutaneously or via ERCP (p742), improves quality of
