on injection. • Volatile agents, eg isofl urane: Nausea and vomiting, cardiac depression, respira- tory depression, vasodilation, hepatotoxicity (see BNF). The complications of anaesthesia are due to loss of: • Pain sensation: Urinary retention, pressure necrosis, local nerve injuries (eg radial nerve palsy from arm hanging over the table edge). • Consciousness: Cannot communicate ‘wrong leg/kidney’. NB: in some patients (eg 0.15%) retained consciousness is the problem. Awareness under GA sounds like a contradiction of terms, but remember that anaesthesia is a process rather than an event. Such awareness can lead to ill-defi ned, delayed neuroses and post-traumatic stress disorder (OHCS p353). • Muscle power: Corneal abrasion ( tape the eyes closed), no respiration, no cough (leads to pneumonia and atelectasis—partial lung collapse causing shunting ± im- paired gas exchange: it starts minutes after induction, and may be related to the use of 100% O2, supine position, surgery, age, and to loss of power). Local/regional anaesthesia If unfi t/unwilling to undergo general anaesthesia, lo- cal nerve blocks (eg brachial plexus) or spinal blocks (contraindication: anticoagula- tion, local infection) using long-acting local anaesthetics such as bupivacaine may be indicated.
