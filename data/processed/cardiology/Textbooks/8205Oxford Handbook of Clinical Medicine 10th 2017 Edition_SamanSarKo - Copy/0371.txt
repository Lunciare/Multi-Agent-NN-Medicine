of cases. Secondary hypertension: ~5% of cases. Causes include: • Renal disease: the most common secondary cause. 75% are from intrinsic renal disease: glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), systemic sclerosis, chronic pyelonephritis, or polycystic kidneys. 25% are due to renovascular disease, most frequently atheromatous (elderly  cigarette smokers, eg with peripheral vascular disease) or rarely fi bromuscular dysplasia (young ). • Endocrine disease: Cushing’s (p224) and Conn’s syndromes (p228), phaeochromo- cytoma (p228), acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism. • Others: coarctation (p156), pregnancy (OHCS p48), liquorice, drugs: steroids, MAOI, oral contraceptive pill, cocaine, amphetamines. Signs and symptoms Usually asymptomatic (except malignant hypertension, see earlier in topic). Headache is no more common than in the general population. Al- ways examine the CVS fully and check for retinopathy. Are there features of an un- derlying cause (phaeochromocytoma, p228, etc.), signs of renal disease, radiofemoral delay, or weak femoral pulses (coarctation), renal bruits, palpable kidneys, or Cush- ing’s syndrome? Look for end-organ damage: LVH, retinopathy and proteinuria—indi- cates severity and duration of hypertension and associated with a poorer prognosis. Tests To confi rm diagnosis: ABPM or home BP monitoring. To help quantify overall risk: Fasting glucose; cholesterol. To look for end-organ damage: ECG or echo (any LV hypertrophy?
