plexuses, and peripheral nerves. The pattern of weakness corresponds to the muscles supplied by the involved neurons. •Aff ected muscles show wasting ± fasciculation (spontaneous involuntary twitching). •There is hypotonia/fl accidity: the limb feels soft and fl oppy, providing little resistance to passive stretch. •Refl exes are reduced or absent; the plantars r emain fl exor. The chief diff erential for LMN weakness is a primary muscle disease (p510)—but here there is symmetrical loss, refl exes are normal or lost late, and there is no sensory component. Mixed LMN and UMN signs: Can occur, eg in MND, B12, taboparesis (see p466). Sensory defi cits: It is important to test individual modalities and remember the quirks of our normal wiring: correctly interpreted, the distribution of sensory loss and the modality involved (pain, T°, touch, vibration, joint-position sense) will help refi ne and increase your confi dence in localizing the lesion (see BOX ‘From fi ndings to neuroanatomy’). Pain and T° sensations travel along small fi bres in peripheral nerves and the anterolateral (spinothalamic) tracts in the cord and brainstem (p516), whereas joint-position and vibration sense travel in large fi bres in peripheral nerves and the large dorsal columns of the cord.
