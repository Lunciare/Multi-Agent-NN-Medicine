As stenosis worsens, A2 is increasingly delayed, giving fi rst a single S2 and then reversed splitting. But this sign is rare. More common is a quiet A2. In severe AS, A2 may be inaudible (calcifi ed valve). There may be an ejection click (pliable valve) or an S4. Tests: ECG: LVH with strain pattern; P-mitrale; LAD; poor R-wave progression; LBBB or complete AV block (calcifi ed ring). CXR: LVH; calcifi ed aortic valve (fi g 3.44); post- stenotic dilatation of ascending aorta. Echo: diagnostic (p110). Doppler echo can estimate the gradient across valves: severe stenosis if peak gradient 40mmHg (but beware the poor left ventricle not able to generate gradient) and valve area <1cm2. If the aortic jet velocity is >4m/s (or is increasing by >0.3m/s per yr) risk of complica- tions is increased. 57 Cardiac catheter can assess: valve gradient; LV function; coronary artery disease; risks: emboli generation. Differential diagnosis: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, p152); aortic sclerosis. Management: If symptomatic, prognosis is poor without surgery: 2–3yr survival if angina/syncope; 1–2yr if cardiac failure. If moderate-to-severe and treated medi- cally, mortality can be as high as 50% at 2yrs, therefore prompt valve replacement (p148) is usually recommended. In asymptomatic patients
