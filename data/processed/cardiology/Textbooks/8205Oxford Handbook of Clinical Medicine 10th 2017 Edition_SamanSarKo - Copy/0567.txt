 due to gland failure. Tests: Ca2+, PO43Ωor , ALP. Signs: Those of hypocalcaemia, p678 ± autoimmune co morbidi ties (BOX ‘Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes’). Causes: Autoimmune; congenital (Di George syn., OHCS p642).  : Ca2+ supplements + calcitriol (or synthetic PTH /12h SC: it prevents hypercalciuria). Secondary hypoparathyroidism Radiation, surgery (thyroidectomy, parathyroid- ectomy), hypomagnesaemia (magnesium is required for PTH secretion). Pseudohypoparathyroidism Failure of target cell response to PTH. Signs: Short metacarpals (esp. 4th and 5th, fi g 5.18), round face, short stature, calcifi ed basal ganglia (fi g 5.19), IQ. Tests: Ca2+, PTH,  or ALP. : As for 1° hypoparathyroidism. Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism The morphological features of pseudoh ypo- parathyroidism, but with normal biochemistry. The cause for both is genetic. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 222222 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN types 1, 2a, and 2b) 223 In MEN syndromes there are functioning hormone-producing tumours in multiple organs (they are inherited as autosomal dominants).20 They comprise: •MEN-1 and 2 •Neurofi bromatosis (p514) •Von Hippel–Lindau and Peutz–Jeghers syndromes (p712 & p708) •Carney complex (spotty skin pigmentation, schwannomas, myxoma of skin, mucosa, or heart, especially atrial myxoma), and endo crine tumours: eg pituit ary adenoma, adrenal hyperplasia, and testicular tumour. MEN-1: • Parathyroid hyperplasia/adenoma (~95%;
