deep to superfi cial veins. If they become incompetent there is venous hypertension and dilata tion of the superfi cial veins occurs. Risk factors: Prolonged standing, obesity, pregnancy, family history, and contraceptive pill. Causes: Primary mechanical factors (in ~95%); secondary to obstruction (eg DVT, fetus, pelvic tumour), arteriovenous malformations, overactive muscle pumps (eg cyclists); rarely congenital valve absence. Symptoms ‘My legs are ugly.’ Pain, cramps, tingling, heaviness, and restless legs. But studies show these symptoms are only slightly commoner in those with VVS. Signs Oedema; eczema; ulcers; haemosiderin; haemorrhage; phlebitis; atrophie blanche (white scarring at the site of a previous, healed ulcer); lipodermatosclerosis (skin hardness from subcutaneous fi brosis caused by chronic infl ammation and fat necrosis). On their own VVS don’t cause DVTS (except possibly proximally spreading thrombophlebitis of the long saphe nous vein). Examination See p78. Treatment NICE guidelines11 suggest that the criteria for specialist referral of pa- tients with VVS should be: bleeding, pain, ulceration, superfi cial thrombophlebitis, or ‘a severe impact on quality of life’ (ie not for cosmetic reasons alone). • Treat any underlying cause. • Education—avoid prolonged standing and elevate leg(s) whenever possible; sup- port stockings (compliance is a problem); lose weight; regular walks
