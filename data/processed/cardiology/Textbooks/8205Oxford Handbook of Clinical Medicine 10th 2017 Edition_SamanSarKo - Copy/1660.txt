On ABG there is likely to be a respiratory compensated metabolic acidosis. Concerns should prompt discussion with a renal specialist (a good idea anyway), in case haemo- dialysis is required (p306). • Post-obstructive diuresis In the acute phase after relief of the obstruction, the kidneys produce a lot of urine—as much as a litre in the fi rst hour. It is vital to provide resuscitation fl uids and then match input with output. Fluid depletion rather than overload is the danger here. • Sodium- and bicarbonate–losing nephropathy As the kidney undergoes diu- resis, Na+ and bicarbonate are lost in the urine in large quantities. Replace ‘in for out’ (as mentioned above) with isotonic 1 . 26% sodium bicarbonate solution—this should be available from ITU. Some advocate using 0.9% saline, though the chlo- ride load may exacerbate acidosis. Withhold any nephrotoxic drugs. • Infection Treat infection, bearing in mind that the WCC and CRP may be part of the stress response. Send a sample of urine for MC&S. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 664411 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 642 Benign prostatic hyperplasia Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is common (24% if aged 40–64; 40% if older).
