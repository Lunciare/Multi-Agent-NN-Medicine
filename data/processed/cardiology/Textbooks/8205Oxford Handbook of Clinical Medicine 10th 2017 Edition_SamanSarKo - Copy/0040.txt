Handbook of Clinical medicine

protect doctors and better equip them to meet, and learn from, the challenges of clinical practice:12 • Self-directedness correlates strongly with resilience. A personal sense of responsi- bility allows learning from mistakes and moving on. • Cooperativeness is the ability to work with opinions and behaviours diff erent to your own, preventing them becoming a source of stress. • Clinicians who are low in harm avoidance are better able to accept uncertainty and a degree of risk. This facilitates decision-making as it is unclouded by anxiety and pessimism about potential problems. Supervised experience outside your comfort zone may help you deal better with uncertainty. • Be persistent but set realistic goals. Perfectionism can be detrimental. • Task-orientated coping occurs when a situation is seen as changeable. This is as- sociated with less burnout than emotion-orientated coping when situations are considered unchangeable: don’t just do something, stand there. • Be self-aware. Development or modifi cation of your personality traits may reduce your vulnerability. 7 The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, 1962: Ransom Stoddard (Jimmy Stewart) becomes a legend after killing Liberty Valance in a duel. It does not matter that the real shooter was Tom Doniphon (John Wayne) all along. 12
