skin epithelial cells. Leads to virus containing vesicles = chicken pox. Virus then remains dormant in sensory nerve roots. Reactivation is dermatomal = shingles. Presentation: • Chicken pox: prodrome 1–2d: fever, malaise, headache, abdominal pain. Then rash (fi g 9.14): pruritic, erythematous maculesvesicles, crust in ~48h. Infectious 1–2d pre-, to 5d post-rash development (lesions scabbed). Complications  in immunosuppression: encephalitis (cerebel- lar ataxia), VZV pneumonia, transverse myelitis, pericarditis, purpura fulminans/DIC. • Shingles: painful, hyperaesthetic area, then Fig 9.14 Chicken pox (VZV). macularvesicular rash in dermatomal distri- © D A Warrell. bution. Disseminated infection if immunosup- pressed. Infectious until scabs appear. Chicken pox risk in non-immune contacts. Complications: post-herpetic neuralgia, Ramsay Hunt syndrome (p501). Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis unless immunosuppressed: viral PCR, culture, immuno- fl uorescence. Treatment: Oral aciclovir/valaciclovir for uncomplicated chicken pox/shingles in adults, aim to give within 48h of rash. IV aciclovir if pregnant, immunosuppressed, severe/disseminated disease (including ocular). Prevention: Vaccination: not routine in children in UK, given at aged 70 to prevent shingles reactivation. VZV immunoglobulin if non-immune exposure in immunosup- pression, pregnancy, neonates. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 440044 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (human herpesvirus 4) 405 Virus targets circulating B lymphocytes (lifelong latent infection) and squamous epi- thelial
