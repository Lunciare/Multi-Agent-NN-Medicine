(p232). Ensure steroids are given before levothyroxine, as thyroxine may precipitate an adrenal crisis. For Cushing’s disease see p225, prolactinoma p236, acromegaly p238. • Surgery: (fi g 5.26) Most pituitary surgery is trans-sphenoidal, but if there is supra- sellar extension, a trans-frontal approach may be used. For prolactinoma, 1st-line treatment is medical with a dopamine agonist, p236. Pre-op: ensure hydrocortisone 100mg IV/IM. Subsequent cortisol replacement and reasse ssment varies with local protocols: get advice. Post-op: retest pituitary function (p232) to assess replace- ment needs. Repeating dynamic tests for adrenal function ≥6 weeks post-op. • Radiotherapy: (Eg stereotactic.) Good for residual or recurrent adenomas (good rates of tumour control and normalization of excess hormone secretion).27 Post-op Recurrence may occur late after surgery, so life-long follow-up is required. Fertility should be discussed: this may be reduced post-op due to gonadotropins. Pituitary apoplexy Rapid pituitary enlargement from a bleed into a tumour may cause mass eff ects, cardiovascular collapse due to acute hypopituita rism, and death. Suspect if acute onset of headache, meningism, GCS, ophthalmop legia/visual fi eld defect, especially if there is a known tumour (may present like suba rachnoid haem- orrhage). : Urgent steroids (hydrocortisone 100mg IV) and meticulous fl uid
