Salbutamol is best given by inhalation (aerosol, powder, nebulizer), but may also be given PO or IV. SE: tachyarrhythmias, K+, tremor, anxiety. Long-act- ing inhaled 2-agonist (eg salmeterol, formoterol) can help nocturnal symptoms and reduce morning dips. They may be an alternative to steroid dose when symptoms are uncontrolled; doubts remain over whether they are associated with an increase in adverse events. 34 SE: as salbutamol, paradoxical bronchospasm. 35 Corticosteroids: Best inhaled to minimize systemic eff ects, eg beclometasone via spacer (or powder), but may be given PO or IV. They act over days to bronchial mu- cosal infl ammation. Rinse mouth after inhaled steroids to prevent oral candidiasis. Oral steroids are used acutely (high-dose, short courses, eg prednisolone 40mg/24h PO for 7d) and longer term in lower dose (eg 5–10mg/24h) if control is not optimal on inhalers. Warn about SEs: p377. Aminophylline: (Metabolized to theophylline) acts by inhibiting phospho diesterase, thus bronchoconstriction by CAMP levels. Try as prophylaxis, at night, PO, to prevent morning dipping. Stick with one brand name (bioavailability variable). Also useful as an adjunct if inhaled therapy is inadequate. In acute severe asthma, it may be given IVI. It has a narrow therapeutic ratio, causing arrhythmias,
