Any change in lower body neurology after an LP (pain, weakness, sensory changes, bladder/bowel disturbance) should be treated as cauda equina compression (hae- matoma/abscess) until proven otherwise. Obtain an urgent MRI spine. Post-LP brain MRI scans often show diff use meningeal enhancement with gado- linium. This is thought to be a refl ection of increased blood fl ow secondary to intracranial hypotension. Interpret these scans with caution and in the context of the patient’s clinical situation. Ensure the reason for the scan and current neuro- logical examination are discussed with the radiologist pre procedure. Post-LP headache Risk 10–30%, typically occurring within 24h of LP, resolution over hours to 2wks (mean: 3–4d). Patients describe a constant, dull ache, more frontal than occipi- tal. The most characteristic symptom is of positional exacerbation—worse when upright. There may be mild meningism or nausea. The pathology is thought to be continued
