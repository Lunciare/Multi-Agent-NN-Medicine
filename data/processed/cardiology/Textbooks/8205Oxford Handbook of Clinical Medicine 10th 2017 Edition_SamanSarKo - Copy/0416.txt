Turner’s syndrome. Signs: Radiofemoral delay; weak femoral pulse; BP; scapular bruit; systolic murmur (best heard over the left scapula); cold feet. Complications: Heart failure from high afterload; IE; intracer- ebral haemorrhage. Tests: CT or MRI-aortogram; CXR may show rib notching as blood diverts down intercostal arteries to reach the lower body, causing these vessels to dilate and erode local rib bone. Treatment: Surgery, or balloon dilatation ± stenting.

It is also the most common cyanotic heart defect that survives to adulthood, accounting for 10% of all ACHD. 72 It is believed to be due to abnormalities in separation of the truncus arteriosus into the aorta and pulmo- nary arteries early in gestation (fi g 3.52). The ‘tetralogy’ of features are: 1 Ventricular septal defect (VSD). 2 Pulmonary stenosis. 3 Right ventricular hypertrophy. 4 The aorta overrides the VSD, accepting right heart blood. A few patients also have an ASD, which makes up the pentad of Fallot. Presentation: Severity of illness depends greatly on
