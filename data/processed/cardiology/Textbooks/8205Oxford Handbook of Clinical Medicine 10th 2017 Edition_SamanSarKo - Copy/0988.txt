Such confi dence failed to consider that the capacity for a prokaryotic micro-organism to develop resistance far outstrips the human capacity to develop new antibiotic drugs. Antibiotic resistance can be: • Intrinsic: due to inherent structural or functional characteristics, eg vancomycin cannot cross the outer membrane of Gram-negative organisms. • Acquired: bacteria have been evolving to resist antibacterial agents for billions of years through mutation and/or the transfer of resistance properties. This evo- lutionary phenomenon is accelerated by selection pressure from antibiotic use (including agriculture, aquaculture, and horticulture) which provides a competi- tive advantage for mutated, resistant strains. Resistance has emerged for all known antibiotics causing morbidity, mortality, and a huge cost burden worldwide.1 Misadventure is evident. Quinolones are syn- thetic, resistance cannot be acquired in nature, and yet it is epidemic. Which brings us back to Alexander Fleming who, within 2 years of the mass- production of his ‘miracle-mould’, gave this sage warning in his Nobel lecture of 1945: ‘Mr X has a sore throat. He buys some penicillin and gives himself, not enough to kill the streptococci, but enough to educate
