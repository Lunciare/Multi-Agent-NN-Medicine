for CKD at risk for atherosclerotic events unless bleeding risk outweighs benefi t (mortality benefi t unclear in CKD). • Atorvastatin 20mg (and higher if GFR >30) for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. • CKD should not aff ect treatment for heart failure but monitoring of GFR and K+. • GFR <60 may aff ect troponin and BNP values. Interpret results cautiously with con- sideration for the GFR. Preparation for renal replacement therapy (RRT) Planning for RRT should begin in progressive CKD when the risk of renal failure is 10–20% within a year. Referral to nephrology less than 1 year before RRT is required is considered a late referral. All suitable patients should be listed for a deceased donor transplantation 6 months before the anticipated start of RRT. All suitable patients should be informed about the advantages of a pre-emptive living kidney transplant and eff orts made to fi nd a donor (p308). Prescribing in CKD Never prescribe in renal failure before checking how administration should be altered due to a GFR. This will be determined largely by the extent to which a drug is renally excreted. This is signifi cant for aminoglycosides, penicillins, cephalos porins, heparin, lithium,
