• Keratoconjunctivitis: corneal dendritic ulcers. Avoid steroids. See OHCS p416. • Herpetic whitlow: painful vesicles on distal phalanx due to inoculation through a break in the skin. • Herpes encephalitis: most common treatable viral encephalitis. Transfer of virus from peripheral site to brain via neuronal transmission. Prodrome: fever, malaise, headache, nausea. Then encephalopathy: general/focal signs of cerebral dysfunc- tion including psychiatric symptoms, seizure, focal neurology (temporal involve- ment in ~60%), memory loss. Predominantly HSV1 in immunocompetent patients. • Secondary infection: eg HSV infection of eczematous skin—eczema herpeticum. Diagnosis: Clinical diagnosis. Confi rmation required in encephalitis, keratoconjunc- tivits, or immunosuppression: viral PCR of CSF, swab, or vesicle scraping. Also culture, immunofl uorescence, serology. Treatment: Aciclovir: symptoms and viral shedding, will not prevent latent infec- tion. Give empirical IV aciclovir as soon as HSV encephalitis is suspected, mortality ~70% in untreated disease (see p824). Varicella zoster virus (VZV) (human herpesvirus 3) Primary infection transmitted by respiratory droplets. Incubation 14–21d. Invades respiratory mucosa, replicates in lymph nodes. Disseminates via mononuclear cells to infect skin epithelial cells. Leads to virus containing vesicles = chicken pox. Virus then remains dormant in sensory nerve roots. Reactivation is dermatomal = shingles. Presentation: • Chicken pox: prodrome 1–2d:
