Case–control studies: Patients with the outcome of interest are identifi ed and past exposure is assessed in comparison to ‘controls’ who did not develop the outcome.

Experimental studies: Exposure is allocated to a study group and compared to those who are not exposed, eg randomized controlled trials. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 1188 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem tuoba gniknihT Randomized controlled trials 19 In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), participants are allocated to an intervention/ exposure (eg new drug treatment) or no intervention (eg placebo, standard care) by a process which equates to the fl ip of a coin, ie all participants have an equal chance of being in either arm of the study. The aim is to minimize bias and attempt to get at the truth as to whether the intervention is
