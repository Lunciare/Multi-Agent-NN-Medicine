hypothenar emine nce wasting, weak 5th digit abduction, and 4th and 5th DIP joint fl exion; sensory loss over medial 1½ fi ngers and ulnar side of the hand. Treatment: see BOX ’Managing ulnar mononeuropathies from entrapments’. Radial nerve C5–T1 This nerve opens the fi st. It may be damaged by compression against the humerus. Signs: Test for wrist and fi nger drop with elbow fl exed and arm pronated; sensory loss is variable—the dorsal aspect of the root of the thumb (the anatomical snuff box) is most reliably aff ected. Muscles involved: (‘BEAST’) brachioradialis; extensors; abductor pollicis longus; supinator; triceps. Brachial plexus Pain/paraesthesiae and weakness in the aff ected arm in a vari- able distribution. Causes: Trauma, radiotherapy (eg for breast carcinoma), pro- longed wearing of a heavy rucksack, cervical rib, thoracic outlet compression (also aff ects vasculature), or neuralgic amyotrophy (Parsonage–Turner syndrome: uni- lateral sudden, severe pain, followed over hours by profound weakness, resolv- ing completely over days. May rarely involve the phrenic or lower cranial nerves.) Phrenic nerve C3–5 C3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive: lesions cause orthopnoea with a raised hemidiaphragm on CXR. Causes: Lung cancer, TB, paraneopla stic syn- dromes, myeloma, thymoma, cervical spondylosis/trauma,
