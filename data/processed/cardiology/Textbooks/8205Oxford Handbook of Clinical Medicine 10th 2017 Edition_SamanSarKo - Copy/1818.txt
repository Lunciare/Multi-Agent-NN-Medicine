Absence of muscle phosphorylase enzyme with resulting inability to convert glycogen into glucose (eg R50X mutation of PYGM gene; autosomal recessive). Fatigue & crises of cramps ± hyperthermia. Rhab- domyolysis/myoglobinuria follow exercise. Tests: CK. Muscle biopsy is diagnostic (necrosis and atrophy). : Mod erate aerobic exercise helps (by utilizing alternative fuel substrates).51 Avoid heavy exertion and statins. Sucrose pre-exercise improves performance, as does a carbohydrate-rich diet. Low-dose creatine and ramipril (only if D/D ACE phenotype) may be of minimal benefi t.52 Brian McArdle, 1911–2002 (British paediatrician) Mallory–Weiss tear Persistent vomiting/retching causes haematemesis via an oe- sophageal mucosal tear.
