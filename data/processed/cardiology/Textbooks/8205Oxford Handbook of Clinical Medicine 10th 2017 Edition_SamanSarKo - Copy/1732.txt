of the number of osmoles per kilo- gram of solvent. It is approximated by serum osmolarity (the number of osmoles per litre of solution) using the equation 2(Na+ + K+) + Urea + Glucose, since these are the predominant serum electrolytes. Normal serum osmolarity is 280–300mmol/L, which will always be a little less than the laboratory-measured osmolality—the osmolar gap. However, if the osmolar gap is greater than 10mmol/L, this indicates the presence of additional solutes: consider diabetes mellitus or high blood ethanol, methanol, mannitol, or ethylene glycol. Control of water Control is mainly via serum Na+ concentration, since water intake and loss are regulated to hold the extracellular concentration of Na+ constant. Raised plasma osmolality (eg dehydration or glucose in diabetes mellitus) causes thirst through the hypothalamic thirst centre and the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. ADH increases the passive water reabsorption from the renal collecting duct by opening water channels to allow water to fl ow from the hypotonic luminal fl uid into the hypertonic renal interstitium. Low plasma osmolality inhibits ADH secretion, thus reducing renal water reabsorption. Glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) Defi ned as the volume of fl uid fi ltered by the
