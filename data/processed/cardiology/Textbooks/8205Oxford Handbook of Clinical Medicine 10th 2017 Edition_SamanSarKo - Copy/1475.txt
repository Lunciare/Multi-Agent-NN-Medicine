gets the right surgery. Have the symptoms and signs changed? If so, inform the surgeon. • Assess/balance risks of anaesthesia, and maximize fi tness. Comorbidities? Drugs? Smoker? Optimizing oxygenation before major surgery improves outcome. • Obtain informed consent (p568). • Check proposed anaesthesia/analgesia with anaesthetist. Family history May be relevant, eg in malignant hyperpyrexia (p572); dystrophia myotonica (p510); porphyria; cholinesterase problems; sickle-cell disease. Drugs Any drug/plaster/antiseptic allergies? Inform the anaesthetist about all drugs even if ‘over-the-counter’. Steroids: see p590; diabetes: see p588. • Antibiotics: Tetracycline and neomycin may  neuromuscular blockade. • Anticoagulants: Tell the surgeon. Avoid epidural, spinal, and regional blocks. Aspirin should probably be continued unless there is a major risk of bleeding. Dis- cuss stopping clopidogrel therapy with the cardiologists/neurologists. See p590. • Anticonvulsants: Give as usual pre-op. Post-op, give drugs IV (or by NGT) until able to take orally. Valproate: give usual dose IV. Phenytoin: give IV slowly (<50mg/min, on cardiac monitor). IM phenytoin absorption is unreliable. • -blockers: Continue up to and including the day of surgery as this precludes a labile cardiovascular response. • Contraceptive pill: See BNF. Stop 4wks before major/leg surgery; ensure alterna- tive contraception is used. Restart 2wks after surgery, provided
