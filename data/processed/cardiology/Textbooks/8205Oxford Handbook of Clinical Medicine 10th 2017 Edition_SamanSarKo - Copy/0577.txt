therapy leading to suppression of the pituitary–adrenal axis. This only becomes apparent on withdrawal of the steroids. Other causes are rare and include hypothalamic–pituitary disease leading to ACTH production. Mineralocorticoid pro- duction remains intact, and there is no hyperpigmentation as ACTH. Symptoms Often diagnosed late: lean, tanned, tired, tearful ± weakness, anorexia, dizzy, faints, fl u-like myalgias/arthralgias. Mood: depression, psychosis. GI: nausea/ vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea/constipation. Think of Addison’s in all with un- explained abdominal pain or vomiting. Pigmented palmar creases & buccal mucosa (ACTH; cross-reacts with melanin receptors). Postural hypotension. Vitiligo. Signs of critical deterioration (p836): Shock (BP, tachycardia), T°, coma. Tests Na+ & K+ (due to mineralocorticoid), glucose (due to cortisol). Also: urae- mia, Ca2+, eosinophilia, anaemia. : Short ACTH stimulation test (Synacthen® test): Do plasma cortisol before and ½h after tetracosactide (Synacthen®) 250mcg IM. Addis on’s is excluded if 30min cortisol >550nmol/L. Steroid drugs may interfere with assays: ask lab. NB: in pregnancy and contraceptive pill, cortisol levels may be reass u ring but falsely , due to cortisol-binding globulin. Also: •ACTH: In Addi- son’s, 9AM ACTH is  (>300ng/L: inappropriately high). It is low in secondary causes •21-Hydroxylase adrenal autoantibodies: +ve in autoimmune disease in >80%
