so recovery is slower and the patient is left with two large wounds (sternal and vein harvesting). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 111166 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC Investigating patients with ? stable angina 117 Investigations for ischaemic heart disease (IHD) include: • Exercise ECG—assess for ischaemic ECG changes. • Angiography—either using cardiac CT with contrast, or transcatheter angiogra- phy (more invasive but can be combined with stenting, p112). • Functional imaging (see p108): myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, stress echo (echo whilst undergoing exercise or receiving dobutamine), cardiac MRI. NICE recommend the following investigations when considering stable angina.13 Typical angina in a patient with previously proven IHD: Treat as stable angina; if further confi rmation is required, use non-invasive testing, eg exercise ECG. Typical and atypical angina: CT angiography, fi g 3.20. If inconclusive, use functional imaging as 2nd line and transcatheter angiography as 3rd line. Non-anginal chest pain: Does the patient have ischaemic changes on 12 lead ECG? • Yes: investigate as per typical and atypical angina • No: no further investigations for IHD at this point (unless high clinical suspicion of IHD for other reasons—discuss with a specialist). Ensure alternative chest pain diagnoses are adequately explored. These are guidelines and must be interpreted within
