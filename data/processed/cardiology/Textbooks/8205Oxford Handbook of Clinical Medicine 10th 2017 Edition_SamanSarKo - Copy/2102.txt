Pitfalls in diabetic ketoacidosis • Plasma glucose is usually high, but not always, especially if insulin continued. • High WCC may be seen in the absence of infection. • Infection. Often there is no fever. Do MSU, blood cultures, and CXR. Start broad- spectrum antibiotics (eg co-amoxiclav, p386) early if infection is suspected. • Creatinine. Some assays for creatinine cross-react with ketone bodies, so plasma creatinine may not refl ect true renal function. • Hyponatraemia is common, due to osmolar compensation for the hyperglycaemia.  or  [Na+] indicates severe water loss. As treatment commences Na+ rises as water enters cells. Na+ is also low due to an artefact; corrected plasma [Na+] = Na+ + 2.4[(glucose Ω5.5)/5.5]. •
