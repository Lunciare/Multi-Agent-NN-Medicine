(p822); encephalitis (eg herpes simplex—p404), tropical: ma- laria (p416; do thick fi lms), typhoid, typhus, rabies, trypanosomiasis. • Tumour: 1° or 2° (p528). • Vascular: stroke (p470), subdural (p482), subarachnoid (p478), hypertensive en- cephalopathy (p140). • Epilepsy: non-convulsive status (p484) or post-ictal state. Immediate management See fi g 19.2 (and coma CNS exam, p789). • Assess Airway, Breathing, and Circulation. Consider intubation if GCS <8 (p788). Sup- port the circulation if required (ie IV fl uids). Give O2 and treat any seizures. Protect the cervical spine unless trauma is known not to be the cause. • Check blood glucose; give eg 200mL 10% glucose IV stat if hypoglycaemia possible. • IV thiamine if any suggestion of Wernicke’s encephalopathy; see later in topic. • IV naloxone (0.4–2mg IV) for opiate intoxication (may also be given IM or via ET tube); IV fl umazenil (p842) for benzodiazepine intoxication only if airway comp- romised as risk of seizures especially if concomitant tricyclic intoxication. Examination Vital signs are vital—obtain full set, including temperature. • Signs of trauma—haematoma, laceration, bruising, CSF/blood in nose or ears, frac- ture ‘step’ deformity of skull, subcutaneous emphysema, ‘panda eyes’. • Stigmata of other illnesses: liver disease, alcoholism, diabetes, myxoedema.
