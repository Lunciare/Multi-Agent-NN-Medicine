to monitored bed; start PPI (eg omeprazole 40mg/12h IV/PO; meta-analyses show 72h IVI eg omepra- zole 80mg bolus then 8mg/h not superior). If haemodynamically stable start oral intake of clear liquids 6h after endoscopy. Treat if positive for H. pylori (p253). Low-risk Flat, pigmented spot or clean base. No need for endoscopic haemo- stasis. Consider early discharge if patient otherwise low risk. Give oral PPI (p252). Regular diet 6h after endoscopy if stable. Treat if positive for H. pylori (p253). Gastro-oesophageal varices Submucosal venous dilatation 2° to portal pressures (may not have documented liver disease—suspect varices if alcohol history); bleeding can be brisk, particularly if underlying coagulopathy 2° to loss of hepatic synthesis of clotting factors. Causes of portal hypertension Pre-hepatic: Thrombosis (portal or splenic vein). Intra-hepatic: Cirrhosis (80% in UK); schistosomiasis (commonest worldwide); sar- coid; myeloproliferative diseases; congenital hepatic fi brosis. Post-hepatic: Budd– Chiari syndrome (p696); right heart failure; constrictive pericarditis; veno-occlusive disease. Risk factors for variceal bleeds: Portal pressure, variceal size, endo- scopic features of the variceal wall and advanced liver disease. Management Endoscopic banding (oesophageal) or sclerotherapy (gastric). Prophylaxis: 1°: ~30% of cirrhotics with varices bleed vs ~15% with non-selective -blockade (propranolol 20–40mg/12h PO) or repeat endoscopic
