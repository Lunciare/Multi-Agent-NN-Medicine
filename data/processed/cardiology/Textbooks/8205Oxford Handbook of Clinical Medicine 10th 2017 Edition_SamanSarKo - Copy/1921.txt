This bell-shaped graph (fi g 17.2) is the theoretical basis of reference intervals, and explains ‘lab error’—why some tests repeated at close intervals may reveal slightly diff erent values. Hb for example, has a lab error of ~5g/L. This emphasizes the importance of the clinical picture in decision-making, rather than treating the numbers alone: don’t subject anaemic patients to blood transfusions unless they have a clinical need. See p324. • Range is the lowest and highest value of all observations in the set being studied. • Arithmetic mean is the sum of all observations ÷ by the number of observations. • Median is the middle value (eg 9 data points are higher and 9 are lower). If their distribution is Normal, then the median coincides with the mean. • Standard deviation (SD) is the square root of the variance (the average of the
