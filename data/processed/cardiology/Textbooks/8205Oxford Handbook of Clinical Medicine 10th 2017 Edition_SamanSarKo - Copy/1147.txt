Transmitted via bite of deerfl ies (=mangrove/ mango fl ies) which breed in rainforests of west and central Africa. Presenta- tion: Recurrent pruritic lesions due to angioedema (‘Calabar swellings’), myalgia, arthralgia.

This eerie eye trip causes intense conjunctivitis, which heals if left alone. (Don’t treat until transmigration in the eye is over: on detecting your therapy the worm tends to panic.) Also causes glomerulonephritis, and encephalitis. Diagnosis : Microfi lar- iae
