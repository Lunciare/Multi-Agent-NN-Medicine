of malignant trans- formation that will relate to size and histology (tubular or villous adenomas, esp. if >2cm). Patients with polyps may have no symptoms and thus a colonoscopy is required to detect and remove. Colonscopy allows the opportunity to detect colo- rectal cancer at an earlier stage when treatment may be more eff ective. However, population-based colonoscopic screening is costly and some studies have suggested that the test does not impact on deaths from right-sided can- cers which are rarer and harder to detect (fi g 13.34). Therefore, the NHS has intro- duced a one-off screening fl exible sigmoidoscopy off ered to all people in their 55th year. Trial results have shown the incidence of colorectal cancer in the intervention (screening) group is reduced by 33% and mortality from colorectal cancer is reduced by 43%. Number needed to screen to prevent one diagnosis (=191); or death (=489). In parallel, the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme (introduced in 2006) of- fers colonoscopy to all men and women aged 60–75 who test positive for faecal occult blood (FOB) using a home testing kit performed every 2 years. This FOB- stratifi cation targets screening to those in the highest risk groups, permitting
