For acute cholecystitis Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute cholecystitis has traditionally been performed 6–12wks after the acute episode due to antici- pated increased mortality and conversion to open procedure. Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy, within 7d of symptom onset, is now the treatment of choice. Early surgery reduces the duration of hospital admission compared with delayed surgery, but does not reduce mortality or complications.
