Presentation: Usually asymptomatic infection in childhood. Infectious mononucleosis in ~50% of primary infection in adults: sore throat, fever, anorexia, lymphadenopathy (esp. posterior triangle of neck), palatal petechiae, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, jaun- dice. Malaise is prominent. Resolution of symptoms usually within 2 weeks. Chronic active infection and recurrence are rare. Oncogenicity: see BOX ‘Oncogenic viruses’. Diagnosis: • Blood fi lm: lymphocytosis. Atypical lymphocytes (large, irregular nuclei) also occur in other viral infection (CMV, HIV, par vovirus, dengue), toxoplasmosis, typhus, leukae- mia, lymphoma,drug reactions, lead poisoning. • Heterophile antibody tests (eg Monospot® , Paul-Bunnell) detect non-EBV heterophile antibodies which are present in ~85% of infectious mononucleosis sera. False posi- tive: pregnancy, autoimmune disease, lymphoma/leukaemia. • Serology: IgM to EBV viral capsid antigen in acute infection. IgG if past infection. • Reverse transcriptase viral PCR. Treatment: Supportive. Seek expert help if severe disease/immunosuppression: observational data on the use of antivirals and steroids. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (human herpesvirus 5) 50–100% of adults are seropositive depending on socioeconomic and sexual risk. Latent infection: periodic,
