Within a single slice (eg 0.5 or 5mm thick), CT records the attenuation (=loss of energy from, eg absorption or refl ection) of diff erent tissues to ionizing ra- diation and calculates a mean value for a given volume of tissue (a ‘voxel’). This value is represented in greyscale as a single point, called a pixel, in the fi nal 2D image (or 3D ‘reconstruction’—fi g 16.13). The greyscale of the pixel is measured on the Hounsfi eld scale (see fi g 16.10) relative to the attenuation of water, 0 Hounsfi eld units (HU), and air, Ω1000HU. The human eye and display systems have a limited greyscale range, so diff erent settings (levels and ‘windows’) are used
