cutaneous Schwannomas without the bilat- eral vestibular Schwannomas that are characteristic of NF2. Indistinguishable from mosaic NF2, where vestibular Schwannomas are also absent, except by genetic analysis of tumour biopsies. There is typically a large tumour load, assessable only by whole-body MRI. Mutations in the tumour suppressor genes SMARCB1 and LZTR1 and spontaneous NF2 mutations have all been described. Life expectancy is normal. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 551144 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN Diagnostic criteria for neurofi bromatosis 515 NF1 (von Recklinghausen’s disease): Diagnosis is made if 2 of the following are found: 1 ≥6 café-au-lait macules >5mm (pre-pubertal) or >15mm (post-pubertal) 2 ≥2 neurofi bromas of any type or 1 plexiform 3 Freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions 4 Optic glioma 5 ≥2 Lisch nodules 6 Distinctive osseous lesion typical ofN F1, eg sphenoid dysplasia 7 First-degree relative withN F1 according to the above-listed criteria.
