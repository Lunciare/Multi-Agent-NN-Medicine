days, 35.5% in the next week). Other factors that suggest increased risk are: • AF • >1 TIA in a week • TIA while anticoagulated. Crucially, risk is lowest if the patient is treated in a specialized stroke unit (p474).

Incidence 9/100 000/yr; typical age: 35–65. Symptoms Sudden-onset excruciating headache, typically occipital—like a ‘thun- derclap’. Vomiting, collapse, seizures, and coma often follow. Coma/drowsiness may last for days. Some patients report a preceding, ‘sentinel’ headache, perhaps due to a small warning leak from the off ending aneurysm (~6%). Signs Neck stiff ness; Kernig’s sign (takes 6h to develop); retinal, subhyaloid and vit- reous bleeds (=Terson’s syndrome; mortality ≈ 5). Focal neurology at presentation may suggest site of aneurysm (eg pupil changes indicating a IIIrd nerve palsy with a posterior communicating artery aneurysm) or intracerebral haematoma. Later defi cits suggest complications (see later in topic). Causes • Berry aneurysm rupture
