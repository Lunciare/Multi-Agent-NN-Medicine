by turning and review weight-bearing areas often. Use ap- propriate pressure-relieving mattresses/cushions. Prevent thrombosis in para- lysed limbs by frequent passive movement, pressure stockings, and LMWH (p350). Bladder care is vital; catheterization is only one option (do not control inconti- nence by decreasing fl uid intake). Bowel evacuation may be manual or aided by suppositories; increasing dietary fi bre intake may help. Exercise of unaff ected or partially paralysed limbs is important to avoid unnecessary loss of function. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 446677 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 468 Abnormal involuntary movements (dyskinesia) These are characterized by impairment of the planning, control, or execution of movement. They can have multiple manifestations: Tremor Note frequency, amplitude, and exacerbating factors (stress; fatigue). • Rest tremor: Abolished on voluntary movement. Cause: parkinsonism (p494). • Intention tremor: Irregular, large-amplitude, worse at the end of purposeful acts, eg fi nger-pointing or using a remote control. Cause: cerebellar damage (eg MS, stroke). • Postural tremor: Absent at rest, present on maintained posture (arms out stretched) and may persist (but is not worse) on movement. Causes: benign essential tremor (autosomal dominant; improves with alcohol), thyrotoxicosis, anxiety, -agonists. • Re-emergent tremor: Postural tremor developing after a delay of ~10s. Causes: Parkinson’s disease (don’t
