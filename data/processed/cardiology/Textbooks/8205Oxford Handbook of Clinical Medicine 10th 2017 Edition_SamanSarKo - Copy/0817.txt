(~10% adult pa- tients) and renal vein thrombosis (loin pain, haematuria, LDH, AKI if bilateral). Treat with heparin (may need to dose adjust low-molecular-weight heparin if GFR) and warfarin. If low bleeding risk, consider prophylaxis when albumin <20g/L. • Infection. Urine losses of immunoglobulins and immune mediators lead to risk of urinary, respiratory, and CNS infection. Infection also seen in areas of fl uid ac- cumulation: cellulitis, peritonitis, empyema. Ensure pneumococcal vaccination given. Risk of varicella with steroid treatment: post-exposure prophylaxis in non-immune, do not give live vaccine if immunosuppressed. • Hyperlipidaemia. Cholesterol (>10mmol/L), LDL, triglycerides, HDL. Thought due to hepatic synthesis in response to oncotic pressure and defective lipid breakdown. Abnormalities are proportional to proteinuria. The benefi ts of statins in CKD are extrapolated to nephrotic syndrome where there is evidence. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 331122 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR Nephrotic glomerulonephritis 313 Nephrotic glomerulonephritides9 include: Minimal change disease ~25% of adult nephrotic syndrome.
