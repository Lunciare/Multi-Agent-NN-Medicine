heart block). • Post-MI—particularly after an inferior MI (the right coronary artery supplies the sinoatrial node and atrioventricular node in most people). • Sick sinus syndrome (p125). • Iatrogenic—ablation, surgery. • Aortic valve disease, eg infective endocarditis (p150; do daily ECGs looking for heart block). • Myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, amyloid, sarcoid, SLE. • Non-cardiac origin: • Vasovagal—very common (p460). • Endocrine—hypothyroidism, adrenal insuffi ciency. • Metabolic—hyperkalaemia, hypoxia. • Other—hypothermia, ICP (Cushing’s triad: bradycardia, hypertension, and ir- regular breathing:  urgent senior input needed). • Drug-induced: • -blockers, amiodarone, verapamil, diltiazem, digoxin. Management Follow a logical approach,6 see fi g 19.11. 6 Think ahead. If you may need an anaesthetist to sedate the patient for transcuta- neous pacing, or a cardiologist for transvenous pacing, call them now. • Perform a 12-lead ECG, check electrolytes (including K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), do digoxin levels. • Connect patient to cardiac monitor/telemetry. • Address the cause: correct metabolic defects; if the patient has adverse signs or is deteriorating, give antidotes to medicines likely to have caused the bradycardia (eg glucagon if -blocker overdose). • If the patient has adverse signs or risk of asystole, give atropine (not to be given if patient has a transplanted heart). •
