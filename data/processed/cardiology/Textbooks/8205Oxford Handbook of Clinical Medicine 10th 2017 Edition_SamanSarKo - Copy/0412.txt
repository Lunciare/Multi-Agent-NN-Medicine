lead rapidly to cardiac arrest. Signs: Pulse, BP, pulsus paradoxus, JVP, Kussmaul’s sign, muffl ed S1 and S2. Diagnosis: Beck’s triad: falling BP; rising JVP; muffl ed heart sounds. ECG: low-voltage QRS ± electrical alternans. Echo is diagnostic: echo-free zone (>2cm, or >1cm if acute) around the heart ± diastolic collapse of right atrium and right ventricle. Management: Seek expert help. The pericardial eff usion needs urgent drainage (p773). Send fl uid for culture, ZN stain/TB culture, and cytology. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 115544 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC Fig 3.51 Pericarditis.

ACHD69 patients are at increased risk of many conditions described else- where, for which many of the ‘standard’ investigations and therapies will apply: includ- ing arrhythmias (p124), heart failure (p134), and infective endocarditis (p150). Investigations Echocardiography (± bubble contrast) is fi rst line. Increasingly, car- diac CT and MR
