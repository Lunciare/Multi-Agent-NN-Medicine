past history). Tests Look for the cause (eg UTI, pneumonia, MI): do FBC, U&E, LFT, blood glucose, ABG, septic screen (urine dipstick, CXR, blood cultures); also consider ECG, malaria fi lms, LP, EEG, CT. Management As well as identifying and treating the underlying cause, aim to:3 • Reorientate the patient: explain where they are and who you are at each encounter. Hunt down hearing aids/glasses. Visible clocks/calendars may help. • Encourage visits from friends and family. • Monitor fl uid balance and encourage oral intake . Be vigilant for constipation. • Mobilize and encourage physical activity. • Practise sleep hygeine: restrict daytime napping, minimize night-time disturbance. • Avoid or remove catheters, IV cannulae, monitoring leads and other devices (they increase infection risk and may get pulled out). • Watch out for infection and physical discomfort/distress. • Review medication and discontinue any unnecessary agents. Only use sedation if the patient is a risk to their own/other patients’ safety (never use physical restraints). Consider haloperidol 0.5–2mg, or chlorpromazine 50–100mg, PO if they will take it, IM if not (p15). Wait 20min to judge eff ect—further doses can be given if needed. NB: avoid chlorp romazine in the elderly and in alcohol withdrawal
