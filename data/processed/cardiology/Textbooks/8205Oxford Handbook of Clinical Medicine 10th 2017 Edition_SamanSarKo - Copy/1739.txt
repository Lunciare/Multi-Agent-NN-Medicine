the acids accumulate. • Lactic acid (shock, infection, tissue ischaemia). • Urate (renal failure). • Ketones (diabetes mellitus, alcohol). • Drugs/toxins (salicylates, biguanides, ethylene glycol, methanol). Causes of metabolic acidosis and a normal anion gap: Due to loss of bicarbonate or ingestion of H+ ions (ClΩ is retained). • Renal tubular acidosis. • Diarrhoea. • Drugs (acetazolamide). • Addison’s disease. • Pancreatic fi stula. • Ammonium chloride ingestion. Metabolic alkalosis pH, HCO3Ω • Vomiting. • K+ depletion (diuretics). • Burns. • Ingestion of base. Respiratory acidosis pH, CO2 • Type 2 respiratory failure due to any lung, neuromuscular, or physical cause (p188). • Most commonly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Look at the PaO2. It will probably be low. Is oxygen therapy required? Use controlled O2 (Venturi connector) if COPD is the underlying cause, as too much oxygen may make matters worse (p189).  Beware exhaustion in asthma, pneumonia, and pulmonary oedema, which can pre- sent with this picture when close to respiratory arrest. A normal or high PaCO2 is worrying. These patients require urgent ITU review for ventilatory support. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 667700 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC Respiratory alkalosis pH, CO2 671 A result of hyperventilation of any cause.
