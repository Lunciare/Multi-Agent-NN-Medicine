fi eld. 5 Unilateral disc swelling = papillitis, bilateral papillitis/disc swelling = papilloedema. Check both eyes! c= structures passing through the cavernous sinus; see BOX ‘Psychiatric symptoms’, p89. NB: Va is the only division of V to do so. p= Remember that these cranial nerves carry parasympathetic fi bres. Sympathetic fi bres originate from the thoracic chain and run with the arterial supply to distribute about the body (see also OHCS, fi g 9.6, p621). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 7711 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 noitanimaxe dna yrotsiH 72 Cranial nerve lesions of the eye Pupillary abnormalities Key questions: • Equal, central, circular, dilated, or constricted? • React to light, directly and consensually? • Constrict normally on convergence/accommodation? Irregular pupils: Anterior uveitis (iritis), trauma to the eye, syphilis. Dilated pupils: CN III lesions (inc. ICP, p830) and mydriatic drugs. Always ask: is this pupil dilated, or is it the other that is constricted? Constricted pupils: Old age, sympathetic nerve damage (Horner’s, p702, and ptosis, p73), opiates, miotics (pilocarpine drops for glaucoma), pontine damage. Unequal pupils (anisocoria): May be due to unilateral lesion, eye-drops, eye surgery, syphilis, or Holmes–Adie pupil. Some inequality is normal. Light reaction: Test: cover one eye and shine light into the other obliquely.
