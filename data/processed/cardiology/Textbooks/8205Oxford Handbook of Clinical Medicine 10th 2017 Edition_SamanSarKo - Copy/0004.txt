have been added to the doctor’s repertoire since Hippocrates, omissions should not undermine the oath as a para- digm of self-regulation amongst a group of specialists committed to an ideal. And do not forget that illness may represent a temporary loss of autonomy caused by fear, vulnerability, and a subjective weighting of present versus future. It could be argued that Hippocratic paternalism is, in fact, required to restore autonomy. Contemporary versions of the oath often fail to make doctors accountable for keeping to any aspect of the pledge. And beware the oath that is nothing more than historic ritual without accountability, for then it can be superseded by per- sonal, political, social, or economic priorities: ‘In Auschwitz, doctors presided over the murder of most of the one million victims…. [They] did not recall being especially aware in Auschwitz of their Hippocratic oath, and were not surprisingly, uncomfortable discussing it…The oath of loyalty to Hitler…was much more real to them.’ Robert Jay Lifton, The Nazi Doctors. 1 This is unlikely to be a commentary on euthanasia (easeful death) as the oath predates the word. Rather, it is believed to allude to the common practice of using doctors as political assassins. 2
