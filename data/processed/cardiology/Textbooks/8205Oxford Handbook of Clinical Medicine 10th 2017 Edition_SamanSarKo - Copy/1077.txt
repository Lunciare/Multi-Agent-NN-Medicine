Caused by related, Gram-negative strains of ‘typhoidal’ Salmonella spp: • Typhoid (~75–90%): Salmonella typhi. • Paratyphoid (~10–25%, less severe): Salmonella paratyphi serotype A>B>C. The bacteria invade the intestinal mucosa. Dissemination occurs without a pri- mary diarrhoeal response. This distinguishes ‘typhoidal’ from ‘non-typhoidal’ se- rovars of Salmonella which cause D&V (p428). Transmission is faecal–oral from contaminated water/food. Incubation 6–30d (most 10–20d). ~10 000 organisms are required to cause illness. Can be asymptomatic (but shed organism). Symptoms: Fatigue, headache, anorexia. Marked
