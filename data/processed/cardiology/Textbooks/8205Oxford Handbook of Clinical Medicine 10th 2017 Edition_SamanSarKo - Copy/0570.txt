Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) from the hypothala- mus stimulates ACTH secretion from the pituitary, which in turn stimulates cortisol and androgen production by the adrenal cortex. Cortisol is excreted as urinary free cortisol and various 17-oxogenic steroids. Cushing’s syndrome This is the clinical state produced by chronic glucocorticoid excess + loss of the normal feedback mechanisms of the hypothalamo–pituitary– adrenal axis and loss of circadian rhythm of cortisol secretion (normally highest on waking). The chief cause is oral steroids. Endogenous causes are rare: 80% are due to ACTH; of these a pituitary adenoma (Cushing’s disease) is the commonest cause. 1 ACTH-dependent causes (ACTH) • Cushing’s disease: Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia from an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (usually a microadenoma, p234). :>1:1.
