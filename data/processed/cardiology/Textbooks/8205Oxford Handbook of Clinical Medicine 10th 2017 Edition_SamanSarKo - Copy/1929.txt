withold the next dose until level <1mg/L (recheck after 12–24h). Lithium2 (12h post dose). Guidelines vary: 0.4–0.8mmol/L is reasonable. Early signs of toxicity (Li+ >1.5mmol/L): tremor. Intermediate: lethargy. Late: (Li+ >2mmol/L) spasms, coma, fi ts, arrhythmias, renal failure (haemodialysis may be needed). See OHCS p349. Phenytoin.1,2 Trough: 40–80μmol/L (10–20mg/L). Beware if albumin, as the assay is for bound phenytoin, while it is free pheny toin that is pharmacologically important. Signs of toxicity: ataxia, diplopia, nystagmus, sedation, dysarthria. Theophylline 10–20mg/mL (55–110μmol/L). (See p810.) Take sample 4–6h after starting an infusion (which should be stopped for ~15min just before the specimen is taken). Signs of toxicity: arrhythmias, anxiety, tremor, convulsions. Vancomycin.1,2 Renally excreted; dosing guided by age and renal function but typi- cally 500mg–1g/12h. Check trough levels prior to 3rd dose, aiming for: 5–10 mg/L (10–15mg/L in SBE/IE and less-sensitive MRSA infections). If levels too low check drug being given then cautiously increase dose; if levels high then confi rm timing of dose/ levels, omit next dose, recheck levels, and consider decreasing dose or frequency. 1 Trough levels should be taken just before the next dose. If values abnormally high, check that sample was indeed a trough level and not taken post-dose.
