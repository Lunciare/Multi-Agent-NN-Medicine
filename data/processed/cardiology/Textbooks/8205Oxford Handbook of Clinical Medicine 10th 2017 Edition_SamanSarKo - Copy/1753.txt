ca- tion and renal failure. Thyrotoxicosis causes alkalaemia because of hyperventilation.7 Treating acute hypercalcaemia Diagnose and treat the underlying cause. If Ca2+ >3.5mmol/L and symptomatic: 1 Correct dehydration: If dehydrated give IV 0.9% saline. 2 Bisphosphonates: These prevent bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclast ac- tivity. A single dose of pamidronate lowers Ca2+ over 2–3d; maximum eff ect is at 1wk. Infuse slowly, eg 30mg in 300mL 0.9% saline over 3h via a largish vein. Max dose 90mg (see table 14.4). Zoledronic acid is signifi cantly more eff ective in reducing serum Ca2+ than previously used bisphosphonates.8 Usually, a single dose of 4mg IV (diluted to 100mL, over 15min) will normalize plasma Ca2+ within a week. SE, fl u symptoms, PO43Ω, bone pain, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, head- ache, lymphocytopenia, Mg2+, Ca2+, seizures. 3 Further management: Chemotherapy may help in malignancy. Steroids are used in sarcoidosis, eg prednisolone 40–60mg/d. Salmon calcitonin acts similar- ly to bisphosphonates, and has a quicker onset of action, but is now rarely used. NB: the use of furosemide is contentious, as supporting RCT evidence is scant.9,10 It helps to promote renal excretion of Ca2+, but can exacerbate hypercalcaemia by worsening dehydration. Thus it should only be used
