can be diffi cult to aspirate, try withdrawing or advancing a few cm or turning the patient on the left side to help dip the tube in gastric contents. Aspirates should be >0.5mL and tested directly on unhandled pH paper. Allow 10s for colour change to occur. • If the pH is >5.5 and the NGT is needed for drug or feed administration then the position must be checked radiologically. Request a CXR/abdo X-ray (tell the radi- ologist why you need it). Look for the radio-opaque line/tip (this can be hard to see, look below the diaphragm, but if in doubt, ask for help from the radiologist). • The ‘whoosh’ test is NOT an accepted method of testing for tube position. • Either spigot the tube, or allow to drain into a dependent catheter bag secured to clothing (zinc oxide tape around tube to form a fl ap, safety pin through fl ap). Do not pass a tube nasally if there is any suspicion of a facial fracture. Get senior help if the patient has recently had upper GI surgery—it is not good practice to push the tube through a fresh anastomosis. Complications •Pain, or, rarely: •Loss of electrolytes •Oesophagitis
