in the arm, extensors are predominantly aff ected; in the leg the opposite is true and the fl exors are the weaker muscle group. •Spasticity develops in the stronger muscle groups (arm fl exors and leg extensors). It manifests as tone that is velocity-de- pendent, ie the faster you move the patient’s muscle, the greater the resistance, until it fi nally gives way (like a ‘clasp-knife’).2 •Muscle wasting is less prominent. • There is hyperrefl exia: refl exes are brisk. • Plantars are upgoing (+ve Babinski sign) ± clonus (elicited by rapidly dorsi fl exing the foot; ≤3 rhythmic, downward beats of the foot are normal). •Loss of skilled fi ne fi nger move ments may be greater than expected from the overall grade of weakness (see BOX ‘Muscle weakness grading’). UMN lesions can mimic LMN lesions in the fi rst few hours before spasticity and hyperrefl exia develop. Lower motor neuron (LMN): Lesions are caused by damage anywhere from the ante- rior horn cells distally, including the nerve roots, plexuses, and peripheral nerves. The pattern of weakness corresponds to the muscles supplied by the involved neurons. •Aff ected muscles show wasting ± fasciculation (spontaneous involuntary twitching). •There is hypotonia/fl
