Try to put the patient at ease: a good rapport may relieve distress. Introduce yourself and check whether the patient is comfortable. Be conversational rather than interrogative. Start with open ques- tions, allow the patient to tell their story, but if they stray off topic, gently steer them back towards the important points. Presenting complaint (PC) Open questions: ‘Why have you come to see me today?’ Record the patient’s own words rather than medical terms. History of presenting complaint (HPC) When did it start? What was the fi rst thing noticed? Progress since then. Ever had it before? ‘SOCRATES’ questions: site; onset (gradual, sudden); character; radiation; associations (eg nausea, sweating); timing of pain/duration; exacerbating and alleviating factors; severity (eg scale of 1–10, compared with worst ever previous pain). Direct questioning (to narrow list of possible diagnoses). Specifi c or ‘closed’ questions about the diff erential diagnoses you have in mind (+risk factors, eg travel—p414) and a review of the relevant system. Past medical history (PMH) Ever in hospital? Illnesses?
