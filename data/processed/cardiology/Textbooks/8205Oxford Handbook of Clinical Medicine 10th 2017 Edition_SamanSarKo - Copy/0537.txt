Bed rest ± therapeutic shoes. For Charcot joints: bed rest/crutches/total contact cast until oedema and local warmth reduce and bony repair is complete (8wks). Bisphosphonates may help. Charcot joints are also seen in tabes dorsalis, spina bifi da, syringomyelia, and leprosy. Metatarsal head sur- gery may be needed. If there is cellulitis, admit for IV antibiotics. Common organ- isms: staphs, streps, anaerobes. Start empirically (as per your local guidance) with benzylpenicillin 1.2g/6h IV and fl ucloxacillin 1g/6h IV ± metronidazole 500mg/8h IV. IV insulin may improve healing. Get surgical help early. The degree of peripheral vas- cular disease, general health, and patient request will determine degree of vascular reconstruction/surgery. Absolute indications for surgery: Abscess or deep infection; spreading anaerobic infection; gangrene/rest pain; suppurative arthritis. Diabetic neuropathies Symmetric sensory polyneuropathy: (‘glove & stocking’ numbness, tingling, and pain, eg worse at night). : paracetamol  tricyclic (ami- triptyline 10–25mg nocte; gradually  to 150mg)  duloxetine, gabapentin, or prega- balin  opiates.
