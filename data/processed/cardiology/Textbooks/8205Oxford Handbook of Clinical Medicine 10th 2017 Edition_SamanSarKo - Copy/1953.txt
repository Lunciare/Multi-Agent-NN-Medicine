catheter: with aseptic technique fl ush and withdraw 20mL of sterile 0.9% saline with a bladder syringe. This may get the fl ow going again. A 3-way catheter may be needed if there is clot or debris retention. If it blocks again, replace it. Repeated fl ushes lead to infection. • Slow decline in urine output over several hours: In a dehydrated/post-op pa- tient a fl uid challenge of 500mL STAT (250mL if cardiac comorbidity) may help, come back and check the response in 30min. Check all other parameters (eg pulse, BP, CVP) and increase rate of background IV fl uids if appropriate. Acute kidney injury (p298): if urine output has tailed off and now stopped, the cause is often renal hypoperfusion (ie pre-renal failure), but consider other fac- tors, eg nephrotoxic drugs. • Catheter is bypassing: A condom catheter may be more appropriate. • Catheter has dislodged into the proximal (prostatic) urethra: Possible even if the balloon is fully infl ated. Consider this if a fl ush enters but cannot be with- drawn. If the patient still needs a catheter then replace it, consider a larger size. • The catheter has perforated the lower urinary tract on insertion and
