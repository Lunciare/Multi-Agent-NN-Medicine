is not due to renal disease and urological investigation is fi rst-line for all those aged >40 years. See p294. • Asymptomatic proteinuria: Normal renal protein excretion is less than 150mg/24 hours (non-pregnant). Quantifi cation by 24h urine collection is unreli- able and rarely used in clinical practice. A spot urinary protein to creatinine ratio (P:CR) >15mg/mmol or urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (A:CR) >2.5() or 3.5()mg/mmol may signify either glomerular (common) or tubular (rare) pathology. • Abnormal renal function (GFR): The glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) is a meas- ure of how much blood the kidneys are cleaning per minute. Direct measure- ment is invasive and time-consuming. Estimations derived from equations based on serum creatinine are widely used to give an eGFR (see p669). Errors in eGFR are caused by non-steady-state conditions, conditions which alter serum creatinine (diet, muscle mass), and eGFR is less accurate at higher levels of GFR. eGFR is therefore only part of the assessment of renal function. • High blood pressure: A renal aetiology should be excluded if hypertension oc- curs with any indicators of renal disease: haematuria, proteinuria, eGFR. • Electrolyte abnormalities: Disorders of sodium, potassium, and acid–base bal- ance (pp301 and 670–5) may
