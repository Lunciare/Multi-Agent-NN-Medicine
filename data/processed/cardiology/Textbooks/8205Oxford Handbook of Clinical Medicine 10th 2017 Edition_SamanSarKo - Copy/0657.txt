and advanced liver disease. Management Endoscopic banding (oesophageal) or sclerotherapy (gastric). Prophylaxis: 1°: ~30% of cirrhotics with varices bleed vs ~15% with non-selective -blockade (propranolol 20–40mg/12h PO) or repeat endoscopic banding. 2°: after a 1st variceal bleed, 60% rebleed within 1yr. Use banding and non-selective -blockade; transjugular intrahepatic porto–systemic shunt (TIPS) for resistant varices. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 225577 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG 258 Diarrhoea Diarrhoea is characterized by increased stool frequency and volume and decreased consistency—though patients’ perspectives of these may vary wildly. History As ever, a careful history will help narrow myriad causes to just a few. Acute or chronic? If acute (<2wks) suspect gastroenteritis—any risk factors: Travel? Diet change? Contact with D&V? Any fever/pain? HIV; achlorhydria, eg PA, p334, or on acid suppressants, eg PPI? Chronic diarrhoea alternating with constipation sugge sts irritable bowel (p266). Weight, noct ur nal diarrhoea, or anaemia mandate close follow-up (coeliac/UC/Crohn’s?). Bloody diarrhoea: Campylobacter, Shigella/Salmonella (p431), E. coli, amoebiasis (p432), UC, Crohn’s, colorectal cancer (p616), colonic polyps, pseudomembranous co- litis, ischaemic colitis (p620). Fresh PR bleeding: p629. Mucus: Occurs in IBS (p266), colorectal cancer, and polyps. Frank pus: Suggests IBD, diver ticulitis, or a fi stula/abscess. Explosive: Eg cholera; Giardia; Yersinia (p425); Rotavirus. Steatorrhoea: Characterized by
