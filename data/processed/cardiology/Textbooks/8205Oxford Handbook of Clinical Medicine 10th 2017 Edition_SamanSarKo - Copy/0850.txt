LDH, or urobilinogen. These patients will often be mildly jaundiced (but note that haemolysis causes pre-hepatic jaundice so there will be no bilirubin in their urine). Does the patient need a blood transfusion? Probably not if Hb >70g/L. Chronic anaemia in particular can be well-tolerated (though it is crucial to ascertain the cause), and in IDA iron supplements will raise the Hb more safely and cost-eff ec- tively. In acute anaemia (eg haemorrhage with active peptic ulcer), transfusion for those with Hb <70g/L may be indicated. Other factors to consider include comor- bidities (particularly IHD) and whether the patient is symptomatic. In severe anaemia with heart failure, transfusion is vital to restore Hb to a safe level, eg 60–80g/L, but this must be done with great care. Give it slowly with 10– 4 0mg furosemide IV/PO with alternate units (dose depends on previous exposure to diuretics; do not mix with blood). Check for signs of worsening overload: rising JVP and basal crackles: in this eventuality, stop and treat. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 332244 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 325 Fig 8.3 ‘Conjunctival pallor’, the classic sign of anaemia, is a confusing term as the conjunctiva is translucent, trans mitting the colour of structures under it.
