Tests: AST and ALT rise 22–40d after exposure (ALT may be >1000IU/L), returning to normal over 5–20wks. IgM rises from day 25 and means recent infection. IgG is detectable for life. : Supportive. Avoid alcohol. Rarely, interferon alfa for fulminant hepatitis. Active immunization: With inactivated viral protein. 1 IM dose gives immunity for 1yr (20yrs if further booster is given at 6–12 months). Prognosis: Usually self-limiting. Fulminant hepatitis is rare. Chronicity doesn’t occur. Hepatitis B virus (HBV, a DNA virus.) Spread: Blood products, IV drug abusers (IVDU), sexual, direct contact. Deaths: 1 million/yr. Risk groups: IV drug users and their sexual partners/carers; health workers; haemophiliacs; men who have sex with men; haemodialysis (and chronic renal failure); sexually promiscuous; foster carers; close family members of a carrier or case; staff or residents of institutions/prisons; babies of HBSAg +ve mothers; adopted child from endemic area. Endemic in: Far East, Africa, Mediterranean. Incubation: 1–6 months. Signs: Resemble hepatitis A but arthralgia and urticaria are commoner. Tests: HBSAg (surface antigen) is present 1–6 months after exposure. HBeAg (e an- tigen) is present
