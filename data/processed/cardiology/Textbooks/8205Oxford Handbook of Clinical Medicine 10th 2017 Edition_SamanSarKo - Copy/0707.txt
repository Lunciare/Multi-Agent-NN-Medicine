syndrome, p696). Neuro physiology: EEG, evoked potentials (and neuroimaging) have a limited role. Management Beware sepsis, hypoglycaemia, GI bleeds/varices, & encephalopathy: • Nurse with a 20° head-up tilt in ITU. Protect the airway with intubation and in- sert an NG tube to avoid aspiration and remove any blood from stomach. • Insert urinary and central venous catheters to help assess fl uid status. • Monitor T°, respirations, pulse, BP, pupils, urine output hourly. Daily weights. • Check FBC, U&E, LFT, and INR daily. • 10% glucose IV, 1L/12h to avoid hypoglycaemia. Do blood glucose every 1–4h. • Treat the cause, if known (eg GI bleeds, sepsis, paracetamol poisoning, p844). • If malnourished, get dietary help: good nutrition can decrease mortality. Give thiamine and folate supplements (p714). • Treat seizures with phenytoin (p826).1 1 • Haemofi ltration or haemodialysis, if renal failure develops (BOX ‘What is hepato- renal syndrome?’). • Try to avoid sedatives and other drugs with hepatic metabolism (BOX ‘Prescrib- ing in liver failure’ and BNF). • Consider PPI as prophylaxis against stress ulceration, eg omeprazole 40mg/d IV/PO. • Liaise early with nearest transplant centre regarding appropriateness. Treat complications Cerebral oedema: On ITU: 20% mannitol IV; hyperventilate. Ascites: Restrict
