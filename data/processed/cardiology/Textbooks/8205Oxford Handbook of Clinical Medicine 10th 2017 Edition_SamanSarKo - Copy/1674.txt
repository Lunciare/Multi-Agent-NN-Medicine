or GC (gemcitabine and cisplatin) has improved survival compared to cystectomy or ra- diotherapy alone. Methods to preserve the bladder with transurethral resection or partial cyst ectomy + systemic chemot herapy have been tried, but long-term results are disappointing. If the bladder neck is not involved, orthotopic reconstru ction rather than forming a urostoma is an option (both using ~40cm of the patient’s ileum), but adequate tumour clearance must not be compromised. The patient should have all these options explained by a urologist and an oncologist. • T4: Usually palliative chemo/radiotherapy. Chronic catheterization and urinary di- versions may help to relieve pain. Follow-up History, examination, and regular cystoscopy: •High-risk tumours: Every 3 months for 2yrs, then every 6 months. •Low-risk tumours: First follow-up cystos- copy after 9 months, then yearly. Tumour spread Local  to pelvic structures; lymphatic  to iliac and para-aortic nodes; haematogenous  to liver and lungs. Survival This depends on age at surgery. For example, the 3yr survival after cystec- tomy for T2 and T3 tumours is 60% if 65–75yrs old, falling to 40% if 75–82yrs old (op- erative mortality is 4%). With unilateral pelvic node involvement, only 6% of patients survive 5yrs. The 3yr survival
