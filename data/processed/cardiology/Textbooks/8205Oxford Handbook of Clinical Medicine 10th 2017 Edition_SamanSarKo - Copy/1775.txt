(suggests cholestasis; also cirrhosis, abscess, hepatitis, or malignancy). • Bone disease (isoenzyme distinguishable, refl ects osteoblast activity) especially Paget’s, growing children, healing fractures, bone metastases, osteomalacia, os- teomyelitis, chronic kidney disease, and hyperparathyroidism. • Congestive cardiac failure (moderately raised). • Pregnancy (placenta makes its own isoenzyme). Alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST) • Liver disease (suggests hepatocyte damage). • AST also  in MI, skeletal muscle damage (especially crush injuries), and haemolysis. -Amylase • Acute pancreatitis (smaller rise in chronic pancreatitis as less tissue remaining). • Also: severe uraemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe gastroenteritis, and peptic ulcer. Creatine kinase (CK) A raised CK does not necessarily mean an MI. • Myocardial infarction (p118; isoenzyme ‘CK-MB’. Diagnostic if CK-MB >6% of total CK, or CK-MB mass >99 percentile of normal). CK returns to baseline within 48h (unlike troponin, which remains raised for ~10 days),  useful for detecting re-infarction. • Muscle damage (rhabdomyolysis, p319; prolonged running; haematoma; seizures; IM injection; defi brillation; bowel ischaemia; myxoedema; dermatomyositis, p552)— and drugs (eg statins). Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT, GT) • Liver disease (particularly alcohol-induced damage, cholestasis, drugs). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) • Myocardial infarction (p118). • Liver disease (suggests hepatocyte damage). • Haemolysis (esp. sickle cell
