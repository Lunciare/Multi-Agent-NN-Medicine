deaths  by 60% since 2000. Malaria parasites Malaria parasites belong to the genus Plasmodium. >100 species exist of which 5 cause human disease (see table 9.19). Transmission occurs through the bite of an infected Anopheles mosquito. Only female mosquitoes transmit Plasmodium as only females require a blood meal for egg development. Transmission in the absence of a mosquito is rare: vertical (congenital transfer from mother to child), transfusion, organ transplantation, needle-sharing.
