24% O2. Oxygen therapy should be given with care. Nevertheless, don’t leave the hypoxia untreated. • Recheck ABG after 20min. If PaCO2 is steady or lower, increase O2 con centration to 28%. If PaCO2 has risen >1.5kPa and the patient is still hypoxic, consider assisted ventilation (eg NIPPV, p813, ie non-invasive positive pressure ventilation). • If this fails, consider intubation and ventilation, if appropriate. When to consider ABG (arterial blood gas) measurement • Any unexpected deterioration in an ill patient. (Technique: see p771.) • Anyone with an acute exacerbation of a chronic chest condition. • Anyone with impaired consciousness or impaired respiratory eff ort. • Signs of CO2 retention, eg bounding pulse, drowsy, tremor (fl apping), headache. • Cyanosis, confusion, visual hallucinations (signs of PaO2; SAO2 is an alternative). • To validate measurements from transcutaneous pulse oximetry (p162). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 118888 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem tsehC ABG interpretation 189 Normal pH is 7.35–7.45. pH <7.35 indicates acidosis and >7.45 indicates alkalosis. If the pCO is in keeping with the pH, the problem is likely to be a respiratory 2 problem (eg high pCOand pH <7.35 = likely a respiratory acidosis). If the HCOΩ 2 3 is in keeping with the pH, this
