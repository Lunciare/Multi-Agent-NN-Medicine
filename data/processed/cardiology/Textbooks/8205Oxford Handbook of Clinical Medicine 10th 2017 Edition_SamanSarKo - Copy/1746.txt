The worry is of myocardial hyperexcitability leading to ven- tricular fi brillation and cardiac arrest. First assess the patient—do they look unwell, is there an obvious cause? If not, could it be an artefactual result? Concerning signs and symptoms Include a fast irregular pulse, chest pain, weak- ness, palpitations, and light-headedness. ECG: (see fi g 14.4) tall tented T waves, small P waves, a wide QRS complex (eventually becoming sinusoidal), and ventricular fi bril- lation. Artefactual results: If the patient is well, and has none of the above-mentioned fi ndings, repeat the test urgently as it may be artefactual, caused by: •haemolysis (diffi cult vene puncture; patient clenched fi st) •contamination with potassium EDTA anticoagulant in FBC bottles (do FBCS after U&ES) •thrombocythaemia (K+ leaks out of platelets during clotting) •delayed analysis (K+ leaks out of RBCS; a particular problem in a primary care setting due to long transit times to the lab).5 Causes • Oliguric renal failure. • Addison’s disease (see p226). • K+-sparing diuretics. • Massive blood
