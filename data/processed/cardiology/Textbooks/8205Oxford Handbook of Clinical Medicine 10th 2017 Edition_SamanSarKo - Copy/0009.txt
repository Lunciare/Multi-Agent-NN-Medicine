8 years in perfect health then that intervention would have a QALY value of 8. If a new drug improves your quality of life from 0.5 to 0.7 for 25 years, then it has a QALY value of (0.7 Ω 0.5)≈25=5. Based on the price of the intervention, the cost of 1 QALY can be calculated. Healthcare priorities can then be weighted towards low cost QALYs. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) consid- ers that interventions for which 1 QALY=<£30 000 are cost-eff ective. However, as a practical application of utilitarian theory, QALYs remain open to criticism (table 1.1). Remember that although for a clinician, time is unambiguous and quantifi able, time experienced by patients is more like literature than science: a minute might be a chapter, a year a single sentence.3 Table 1.1 The advantages and disadvantages of QALYs Advantages Disadvantages Transparent societal decision Focuses on slice (disease), not pie (health) making Common unit for diff erent Based on a value judgement that living longer is a interventions measure of success Allows cost-eff ectiveness Quality of life assessment comes from general public, analysis not those with disease Allows international comparison Potentially ageist—the elderly always have less
