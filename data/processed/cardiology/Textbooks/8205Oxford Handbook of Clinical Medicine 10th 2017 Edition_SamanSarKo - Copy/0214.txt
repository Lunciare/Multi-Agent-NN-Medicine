complete ptosis: look for other evidence of a CN III lesion: ophtha lmoplegia with ‘down and out’ deviation of the eye, pupil dil ated and unreactive to light or accommodation. If eye pain too, suspect infi ltration (eg by lymphoma or sarcoidosis). If  T° or consciousness, suspect infection (any tick bites?). 2 Sympathetic paralysis usually causes unilateral partial ptosis. Look for other evidence of a sympathetic lesion, as in Horner’s syndrome (p702): constricted pupil = miosis, lack of sweating on same side of the face (=anhidrosis). 3 Myopathy, eg dystrophia myotonica, myasthenia gravis (cause bilateral partial ptosis). 4 Congenital; usually partial and without other CNS signs. Visual loss Get ophthalmology help. See OHCS p434–p455. Consider: • Is the eye red? (Glaucoma, uveitis p561.) • Pain? Giant cell arteritis: severe temporal headache, jaw claudication, scalp ten- derness, ESR:  urgent steroids (p556). Optic neuritis: eg in MS. • Is the cornea cloudy: corneal ulcer (OHCS p435), glaucoma (OHCS p433)? • Is there a contact lens problem (infection)? • Any fl ashes/fl oaters? (TIA, migraine, retinal detachment?) • Is there a visual fi eld problem (stroke, space-occupying lesion, glaucoma)? • Are there any focal CNS signs? • Any valvular heart disease/carotid
