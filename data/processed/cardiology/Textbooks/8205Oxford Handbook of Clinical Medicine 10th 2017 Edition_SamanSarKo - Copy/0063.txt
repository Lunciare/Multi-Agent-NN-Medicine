may cause A (cancer causes antacid use), a 3rd unknown agent X (eg age) may cause A and B, or the association may be a chance fi nding. When considering the options, it is useful to bear in mind the Bradford Hill ‘criteria’ for causation (NB he did not claim any were essential): 1 Consistency of fi ndings: among diff erent populations, studies, time periods. 2 Temporality: the eff ect must occur after the cause. 3 Biological gradient: a dose response whereby more exposure= more eff ect. 4 Specifi city: exposure causes a single outcome (smoking does not conform!). 5 Strength of association: strong associations are more likely to be causal. 6 Biological plausibility: there is a mechanism linking cause and eff ect. 7 Coherence: the relationship is supported by current disease knowledge. 8 Experiment: does removal of exposure reduce outcome frequency? Epidemiological studies Studies should be designed to give an adequate answer to a specifi c research ques- tion. Samples need to be representative and of suffi cient size to answer the question. Ecological studies: Outcome rates are examined in diff erent populations, eg trend over time, geographically distinct groups, social class. Populations rather than indi- viduals are the
