• 2nd-line therapy: Ezetimibe—a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, may be used in statin intolerance or combination with statins to achive target reduction. • 3rd-line therapy: Alirocumab—a monoclonal antibody against PCSK9 (acts to reduce hepatocyte LDL receptor expression). Very eff ective in reducing LDL,29 but expensive and needs to be given by injection every 2 weeks. Others: fi brates, eg bezafi brate (useful in mixed hyperlipidaemias); anion exchange resins, eg colesty- ramine; nicotinic acid (HDL; LDL; SE: severe fl ushes; aspirin 300mg ½h pre-dose helps this). • Hypertriglyceridaemia: Responds best to fi brates, nicotinic acid, or fi sh oil. Xanthomata These yellow lipid deposits may be: eruptive (itchy nodules in crops in hypertriglyceridaemia); tuberous (plaques on elbows and knees); or planar—also called palmar (orange streaks in palmar creases), ‘diagnostic’ of remnant hyperlipid- aemia; or in tendons (p38), eyelids (xanthelasma, see fi g 14.13), or cornea (arcus, p39). 3 Abbreviations: (V)LDL = (very) low-density lipoprotein; IDL = intermediate-density lipoprotein; HDL = high-density lipoprotein; chol = cholesterol; trig = trigylcerides. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 669900 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC Primary hyperlipidaemias 691 Table 14.8 Classifi cation of primary hyperlipidaemias Familial hyperchylomicronae- Chol <6.5 Eruptive xanthomata; mia (lipoprotein lipase defi - Trig 10–30 lipaemia retinalis; ciency or apoCII
