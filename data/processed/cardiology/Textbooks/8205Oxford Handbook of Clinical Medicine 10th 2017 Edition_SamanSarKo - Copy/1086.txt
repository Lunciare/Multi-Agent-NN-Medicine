ringing in ears. Resistance to ACT is emerging in Asia. Failure rates with antifolate drugs mean Fansidar® is no longer used. Chloroquine is not used in the treatment of falciparum malaria. Severe P. falciparum malaria Give urgent parenteral treatment. Artesunate is treatment of choice. Meta-analysis shows reduction in mortality of 39% (CI: 25–50%) compared to quinine, preventing 94 deaths for every 1000 adults treated.11 IV artesunate is stocked by many infectious disease units in the UK. It can be obtained from tropical disease centres in London (020 3456 7890) and Liverpool (0151 706 2000). Artesunate regimen (adult): 2.4mg/kg IV at 0h, 12h, 24h and then daily for up to 5d. Converted to a full course of ACT (see uncomplicated falciparum earlier in topic) when able to tolerate oral medication. Side-eff ects: delayed haemolysis 7–21d post-treatment (usually self-limiting)—check Hb 14d post treatment. If artesunate is not available immediately, treatment should be started with quinine. It is safe to overlap/combine with artensuate when it is available. Quinine regimen (adult): Loading dose 20mg/kg over 4h. Then 10mg/kg every 8h for next 48h or until patient can swallow (dose every 12h if patient has renal failure or hepatic dysfunction or if IV needed >48h).
