weakness.18 Investigations Plasma: Mildly Ca2+ (but may be severe); PO43Ω; ALP; PTH high; 25(OH)-vitamin D, except in vitamin D resistance. In renal failure, 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D (p312). Biopsy: Bone biopsy shows incomplete mineralization. Muscle biopsy (if proximal myopathy) is normal. X-ray: In osteomalacia, there is a loss of cortical bone; also, apparent partial frac- tures without displacement may be seen especially on the lateral border of the scapula, inferior femoral neck, and medial femoral shaft (Looser’s zones; see fi g 14.9). Cupped, ragged metaphyseal surfaces are seen in rickets (fi g 14.10). Treatment • In dietary insuffi ciency, give vitamin D, eg as one calcium D3 forte tablet/12h PO. • In malabsorption or hepatic disease, give vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), up to 40 000U (=1mg) daily, or parenteral calcitriol, eg 7.5mg monthly. • If due to renal disease or vitamin D resistance, give alfacalcidol (1-hydroxy- vitamin D3) 250ng–1mcg daily, or calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3) 250ng–1mcg daily, and adjust dose according to plasma Ca2+. Alfacalcidol and calcitriol can cause dangerous hypercalcaemia. • Monitor plasma Ca2+, initially weekly, and if nausea/vomiting. Vitamin D-resistant rickets Exists in two forms. Type I has low renal 1-hydroxy- lase activity, and type II has end-organ resistance to 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3,
