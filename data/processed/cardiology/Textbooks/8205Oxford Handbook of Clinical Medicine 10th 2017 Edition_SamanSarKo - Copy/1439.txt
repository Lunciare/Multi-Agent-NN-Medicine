sign is +ve if over back and shoulders). •Lilac-purple (heliotrope) rash on eyelids often with oedema (fi g 12.26, p563). •Nailfold erythema (dilated capillary loops). •Gottron’s papules: roughened red papules over the knuckles, also seen on elbows and knees (pathognomonic if CK + muscle weakness). Malignancy in 30% cases. Extra-muscular signs In both conditions include fever, arthralgia, Raynaud’s, in- terstitial lung fi brosis and myocardial involvement (myocarditis, arrhythmias). Tests Muscle enzymes (ALT, AST, LDH, CK, & aldolase)  in plasma; EMG shows char- acteristic fi brillation potentials; muscle biopsy confi rms diagnosis (and excludes mimicking conditions). MRI shows muscle oedema in acute myositis. Autoantibody associations: (see BOX) anti-Mi2, anti-Jo1—associated with acute onset and intersti- tial lung fi brosis that should be treated aggressively. Diff erential diagnoses Carcinomatous myopathy, inclusion-body myositis, mus- cular dystrophy, PMR, endocrine/metabolic myopathy (eg steroids), rhabdomyoly- sis, infection (eg HIV), drugs (penicillamine, colchicine, statins, or chloroquine). Management Start prednisolone. Immunosuppressives (p376) and cytotoxics are used early in resistant c ases. Hydroxychloroquine/topical tacrolimus for skin disease. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 555522 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolotamuehR Plasma autoantibodies (Abs): disease associations 553 Always interpret in the context of clinical fi ndings: Diff erent antibodies have diff erent disease asssociations.
