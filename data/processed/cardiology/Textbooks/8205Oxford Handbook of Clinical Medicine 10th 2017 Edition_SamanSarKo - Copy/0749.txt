in 10 and a frequency of homozy- gosity of ~1 in 200–400). The gene responsible for most HH is HFE: the 2 commonest mutations are termed C282Y and H63D. C282Y accounts for 60–90% of HH, and H63D accounts for 1–3%, with compound heterozygotes accounting for 4–7%. Penetrance is variable—a signifi cant fraction of C282Y homozygotes will not develop signs of iron overload during follow-up, complicating screening decisions. The patient Early on: Nil—or tiredness; arthralgia (2nd+3rd MCP joints + knee pseudo- gout); libido. Later: Slate-grey skin pigmentation; signs of chronic liver disease (p276); hepatomegaly; cirrhosis (esp. if drinks alcohol); dilated cardiomyopathy. Endocrinopathies: DM (‘bronze diabetes’ from iron deposition in pancreas); hypogonadism (p232) from pituitary dysfunction. Tests Blood: LFT, ferritin (>200/>150ng/mL; but infl ammation will also ferritin); transferrin saturation39 should all trigger suspicion. Confi rm by HFE genotyping. Images: Chondro calcinosis (fi g 6.33). Liver & cardiac MRI: Fe overload. Liver biopsy: Perl’s stain quantifi es iron loading40 and assesses disease severity. Management Venesect: ~0.5–2 units/1–2wks, until ferritin 50mcg/L (may take 2yrs). Iron will continue to accumulate, so maintenance venesection is needed for life (1U every 2–3 months to maintain haematocrit <0.5, ferritin <100mcg/L, and transferrin saturation <40%). Consider desferrioxamine (p342) if
