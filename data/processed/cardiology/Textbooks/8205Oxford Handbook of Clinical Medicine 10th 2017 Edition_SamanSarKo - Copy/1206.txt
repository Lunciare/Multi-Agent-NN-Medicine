The key to diagnosis is to fi nd out ex- actly what the patient means by ‘dizzy:’ if this is not vertigo or if atypical symptoms are present consider other causes, eg if there is loss of awareness, think of epilepsy or syncope; if there is faintness, lightheadedness, or palpitations, think of anaemia, dysrhythmia, anxiety, or hypotension. Associated symptoms: Diffi culty walking or standing (may fall suddenly to the ground), relief on lying or sitting still (vertigo is almost always worsened by move- ment); nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating. Associated hearing loss or tinnitus implies labyrinth or VIIIth nerve involvement. Causes Benign positional vertigo: Occurs on head movement due to disruption of debris in the semicircular canal of the ears (canalolithiasis). Fatiguable nystagmus on performing the Hallpike manoeuvre is diagnostic; Epley manoeuvres clear the debris (OHCS p555). Acute labyrinthitis (vestibular neuronitis): Abrupt onset of severe vertigo, nausea, vomiting ± prostration. No deafness or tinnitus. Causes: virus; vascular lesion. Severe vertigo subsides in days, complete recovery takes 3–4wks. : reassure. Sedate. Ménière’s disease: Increased pressure in the
