congenital (may be associated with other defects, eg ASD, AV canal); appetite suppressants (eg fenfl uramine, phentermine). Symptoms: Dyspnoea; fatigue; palpitations; symptoms of causative factor (eg fever). Signs: AF; displaced, hyperdynamic apex; pansystolic murmur at apex radiating to axilla; soft S1; split S2; loud P2 (pulmonary hypertension). Severity: the more severe, the larger the left ventricle. Tests: ECG: AF; P-mitrale if in sinus rhythm (may mean left atrial size); LVH. CXR: big LA & LV; mitral valve calcifi cation; pulmonary oedema. Echocardiogram: To assess LV function and MR severity and aetiology (transoesoph- ageal to assess severity and suitability for repair rather than replacement). Cardiac catheterization to confi rm diagnosis, exclude other valve disease, and assess coro- nary artery disease (can combine CABG with valve surgery). Management: Control rate if fast AF. Anticoagulate if: AF; history of embolism; pros- thetic valve; additional mitral stenosis. Diuretics improve symptoms. Surgery4 for deteriorating symptoms; aim to repair or replace the valve before LV is irreversibly impaired. Mitral valve prolapse: Is the most common valvular abnormality (prevalence: ~5%). Occurs alone or with: ASD, patent ductus arteriosus, cardiomyopathy, Turner’s syn- drome, Marfan’s syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, WPW (p133). Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic. May develop atypical chest
