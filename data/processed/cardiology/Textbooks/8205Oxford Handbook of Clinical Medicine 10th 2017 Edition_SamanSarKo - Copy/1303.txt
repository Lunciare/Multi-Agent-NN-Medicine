nerve C3–5 C3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive: lesions cause orthopnoea with a raised hemidiaphragm on CXR. Causes: Lung cancer, TB, paraneopla stic syn- dromes, myeloma, thymoma, cervical spondylosis/trauma, thoracic surgery, infec- tions (HZV, HIV, Lyme disease), muscular dystrophy. Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh L2–L3 Meralgia paraesthetica is antero- lateral burning thigh pain from entrapment under the inguinal ligament. Sciatic nerve L4–S3 Damaged by pelvic tumours or fractures to pelvis or femur. Lesions aff ect the hamstrings and all muscles below the knee (foot drop), with loss of sensation below the knee laterally. Common peroneal nerve L4–S1 Originates from sciatic nerve just above knee. Often damaged as it winds round the fi bular head (trauma, sitting cross-legged). Signs: Foot drop, weak ankle dorsifl exion/eversion, sensory loss over dorsal foot. Tibial nerve L4–S3 Originates from sciatic nerve just above knee. Lesions lead to an inability to stand on tiptoe (plantarfl exion), invert the foot, or fl ex the toes, with sensory loss over the sole. Mononeuritis multiplex Describes the involvement of two or more peripheral nerves. Causes tend to be systemic: DM, connective tissue disorders (rheumatoid, SLE), vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis formerly Wegener’s granuloma- tosis, PAN), and more rarely
