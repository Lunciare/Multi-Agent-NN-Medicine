Distal stones are removed via the mouth but deeper stones may require exci- sion of the gland. Chronic bilateral symp- toms may coexist with dry eyes and mouth and autoimmune disease, eg hypothyroidism, Mikulicz’s or Sjögren’s syndrome (p706 & p710)—also bulimia or alcohol excess. Fixed swelling may be from a tumour/ALL (fi g 8.49, Fig 13.20 Normal sialogram of the sub- p355), sarc oid, amyloid, granulomatosis with mandibular gland. Wharton’s (subman- polyangiitis , or be idiopathic. dibular) duct opens into the mouth near Salivary gland tumours (table 13.9) ‘80% are the frenulum of the tongue. in the parotid, 80% of these are pleomorphic adenomas, 80% of these are in the super- fi cial lobe.’ Defl ection of the ear outwards is a classic sign. Remove any salivary gland swelling for assessment if present for >1 month.
