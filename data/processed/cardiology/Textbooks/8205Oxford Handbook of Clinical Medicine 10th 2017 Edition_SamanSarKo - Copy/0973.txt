(anaemia, lym- phopenia), nephritis, pancreatitis, transaminitis. Interactions: Mercaptopurine and azathioprine (which is metabolized to mercaptopurine) are metabolized by xanthine oxidase (XO). So toxicity results if full dose azathioprine co-administered with XO inhibitors (eg allopurinol). Monitoring: Local guidelines should be in place to guide; typically weekly FBC, U&E, creatine, LFT during initation then 1–3-monthly once stable. Ciclosporin, tacrolimus Calcineurin inhibitors with important roles in reducing rejection in organ and marrow transplant. The main SE is dose-related nephrotox- icity: check blood levels. • Other SE: gum hyperplasia (ciclosporin), tremor, BP (stop if ), oedema, paraesthe- siae, confusion, seizures, hepatotoxicity, lymphoma, skin cancer—avoid sunbathing. • Monitor U&E and creatinine every 2 weeks for the fi rst 3 months, then monthly if dose >2.5mg/kg/d (every 2 months if less than this). Reduce the dose if creati- nine rises by >30% on two measurements even if the creatinine is still in normal range. Stop if the abnormality persists. Also monitor LFT. • Interactions are legion: potentiated by: ketoconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, the Pill, erythromycin, grapefruit juice. Effi cacy is reduced by: barbiturates, carbamaz epine, phenytoin, rifampicin. Avoid concurrent nephrotoxics: eg gen- tamicin. Concurrent NSAIDs augment hepatotoxicity—monitor LFT.
