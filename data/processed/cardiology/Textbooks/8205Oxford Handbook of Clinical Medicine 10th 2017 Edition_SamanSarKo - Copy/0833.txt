up to 40%. Aetiology: • Drugs: antibiotics, NSAIDS, PPIS, diuretics, ranitidine, anticonvulsants, warfarin. Take a full drug history including over-the-counter and herbal preparations. • Infection: Streptococcus, Pneumococcus, Staphylococcus, Campylobacter, E. coli, Mycoplasma, CMV, EBV, HSV, hepatitis A-C. • Autoimmune disease: SLE, sarcoid, Sjögren’s syndrome, ANCA. Treatment: Stop causative agent or treat underlying cause. Steroids are used de- spite a paucity of RCT evidence. Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis (CTIN) Insidious onset and slowly progressive renal impairment. Biopsy shows interstitial fi brosis and tubular atrophy. Most commonly due to drugs (>70%) or infection. Pos- sible causes include: • drugs: NSAIDs (p319), lithium, calcineurin inhibitors, aminosalicylates (eg mesala- zine, sulfasalazine), chemotherapy (eg cisplatin) • infection: TB, pyelonephritis, leptospirosis, HIV • immune disease: sarcoid, Sjögren’s syndrome • specifi c nephrotoxins: lead, cadmium, mercury, aristolochic acid (p319) • haematological disorders: myeloma • genetic interstitial disease. Treatment: Stop causative agent or treat underlying cause. Reduce risk of progres- sion as per CKD management: ACE-i/ARB, BP control, glucose, lipids (pp304–5). Future: antifi brotic agents? Nephrotoxins Many agents may be toxic to the kidneys either by direct damage to the tubules, or by causing an interstitial nephritis (see earlier in topic).
