Kidneys: Length equivalent to 2½–3½ vertebral bodies, slope inferolaterally. Right is lower than the left (‘pushed down’ by the liver). Their outline can usually be seen due to surrounding layer of perinephric fat. Ureters: Pass near the tips of the lumbar transverse processes, cross the sacroiliac joints, down to the ischial spines, and turn medially to join the bladder. Other soft tissues Look for size/position of: liver, spleen, and bladder. A big liver will push bowel to the left side of the abdomen. An enlarged spleen displaces bowel and stomach bubble to the right. A big bladder elevates these. Medical devices Double-J and biliary stents, nephrostomy and gastrostomy tubes, intrauterine devices, laparoscopic clips, and peritoneal dialysis catheters can be seen. Bones and joints Plain AXR is not ideal, but there may be important abnormalities. In the lumbar spine, look for scoliosis and degeneration (osteophytes, joint space narrowing) as well as bone metastases or sacroiliitis. 1 Don’t get confused by other calcifi cations—eg phleboliths: harmless calcifi cations found in the perivesical veins (rounded with a radiolucent centre). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 772288 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR 729 Fig 16.8 Multiple dilated air-fi lled loops of large and small bowel.
