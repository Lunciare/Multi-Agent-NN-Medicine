Handbook of Clinical medicine

most symptoms are due to a disease that is already known, and do not imply a new disease (Occam’s razor, p4). The ‘odds ratio’ makes this clearer, ie the ratio of [the probability of the symptom, given the known disease] to [the probability of the symptom due to new disease ≈ the probability of developing the new dis- ease]. Usually this is vastly in favour of the symptom being due to the old disease, because of the prior odds of the two diseases. This will work until Kobble’s dis- ease increases in prevalence so as to increase the odds of a second disease (then Hickam trumps Occam, p4). How to play the odds It is distasteful to think that doctors can gamble with patients’ lives. It is also distasteful to think of serious diseases being ‘missed’, and invasive procedures being done unnecessarily. Yet we do not have an evidence base or an experience base which can tell us defi nitively which cough or lethargy or sore toe is just ‘one of those things’, and which is the result of undiagnosed cancer or HIV or osteomyelitis. And so we gamble. Medicine is not for pessimists—almost anything can be made to seem
