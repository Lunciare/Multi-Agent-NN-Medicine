sometimes required (p763). If in clot retention the patient will require a 3-way catheter and bladder washout. If >1L residual check U&E and monitor for post-obstructive diure- sis (see BOX ‘Obstructive uropathy’). Monitor weight, fl uid balance, and U&E closely. Treat the underlying cause if possible, eg if prostatic obstruction, start an -blocker (see p642). After 2–3 days, trial without catheter (TWOC, p763) may work (especially if <75yrs old and <1L drained or retention was triggered by a passing event, eg GA). 12 Do venepuncture for PSA before PR, as PR can  total PSA by ~1ng/mL (free PSA  by 10%). It’s diffi cult to know if acute retention raises PSA, but relieving obstruction does cause it to drop. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 664400 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Problems of ureteric stenting (depend on site) 641 Common: Rare: • Stent-related pain • Obstruction • Trigonal irritation • Kinking • Haematuria • Ureteric rupture • Fever • Stent misplacement • Infection • Stent migration (especially if made of silicone) • Tissue infl ammation • Tissue hyperplasia • Encrustation • Forgotton stents. • Biofi lm formation.
