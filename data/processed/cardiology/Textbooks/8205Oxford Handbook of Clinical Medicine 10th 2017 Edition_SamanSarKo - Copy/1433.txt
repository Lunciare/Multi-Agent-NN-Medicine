as destructive changes such as erosions, sclerosis, and ankylosis. X-rays can show SI joint space narrowing or widening, sclerosis, erosions, and ankylosis/fusion. Vertebral syndesmophytes are characteristic (often T11–L1 initially): bony proliferations due to enthesitis between ligaments and vertebrae. These fuse with the vertebral body above, causing ankylosis. In later stages, calcifi cation of ligaments with ankylosis lead to a ‘bamboo spine’ appearance. Also: FBC (normocytic anaemia), ESR, CRP, HLA B27 +ve (+ve in 90–95% of cases but only 5% of patients HLA B27 +ve have AS). Management: Exercise, not rest, for backache, including intense exercise regi- mens to maintain posture and mobility—ideally with a specialist physiotherapist. NSAIDS usually relieve symptoms within 48h, and may slow radiographic progres- sion.37 TNF BLOCKERS (eg etanercept, adalimumab) are indicated in severe ac- tive AS.38 Local steroid injections provide temporary relief. Surgery includes hip replacement to improve pain and mobility if the hips are involved, and rarely spinal osteotomy. There is risk of osteoporotic spinal fractures (consider bisphospho- nates). Prognosis: There is not always a clear relationship between the activity of arthritis and severity of underlying infl ammation (as for all the spondyloarth- ritides). Prognosis is worse if ESR >30; onset <16yrs; early hip involvement
