progressive symptoms, bleeding tendency or antic oagulated), or unusual presentation (eg fl uctuating consciousness, fever). Otherwise imaging less urgent (aim <24h). Diff usion-weighted MRI is most sensitive for an acute infarct, but CT helps rule out primary haemorrhage (fi g 10.15). • Antiplatelet agents: Once haemorrhagic stroke is excluded, give aspirin 300mg (continue for 2 weeks, then switch to long-term antithrombotic treatment, p472). • Thrombolysis: Consider this as soon as haemorrhage has been excluded, provided the onset of symptoms was ≤4.5h ago.2 The benefi ts of thrombolysis outweigh the risks within this window, though best results are within 90min. Alteplase is the agent of choice and must be given by trained staff , ideally within an expert acute stroke team.  Always do CT 24h post-lysis to identify bleeds.6 CI to thrombolysis: • Major infarct or haemorrhage on CT. • Mild/non-disabling defi cit. • Recent sur- gery, trauma, or artery or vein puncture at uncompressible site. •Previous CNS bleed. • AVM/aneurysm. • Severe liver disease, varices, or portal hypertension. • Sei- zures at presentation. • Blood glucose (<3 or >22). • Stroke or serious head injury in last 3 months. • GI or urinary tract haemorrhage in the last 21
