Their needs become more complex and they become increasingly dependent. Currently, informal (mostly fam- ily) carers of people with dementia save the UK £11 billion a year. Yet this is not an easy task: most dementia suff erers display behavioural or psychological symptoms, which can be particularly distressing for the carer. Carer stress is inevitable and causes morbidity and mortality. Ameliorate this with: • A care coordinator (via Social Services or the local Old Age Community Mental Healthcare Team); vital to coordinate the various teams and services available: • Laundry services for soiled linen • Attendance allowance • Car badge giving priority parking • Respite care in hospital • Help from occupational therapist,district • Council tax rebate (forms nurses, and community psychiatric nurses from local council offi ce). • Day services can be invaluable for stimulating patients and providing regular, much-needed breaks for carers.
