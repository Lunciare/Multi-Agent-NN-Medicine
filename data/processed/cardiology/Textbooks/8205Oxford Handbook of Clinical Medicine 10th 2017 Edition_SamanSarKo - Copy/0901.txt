factor I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII. Normal range 35–45s. Prolonged by: heparin treatment, haemophilia, DIC, liver disease. • Thrombin time: Thrombin is added to plasma to convert fi brinogen to fi brin. Normal range: 10–15s. Prolonged by: heparin treatment, DIC, dysfi brinogenaemia. • D-dimers are a fi brin degradation product, released from cross-linked fi br in during fi brinolysis (p345). This occurs during DIC, or in the presence of venous thromboembolism—deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). D-dimers may also be raised in infl ammation, eg with infection or malignancy. Management Depends on the degree of bleeding. If shocked, resuscitate (p790). If bleeding continues in the presence of a clotting disorder or a massive transfusion, discuss the need for FFP, cryoprecipitate, factor concentrates, or platelets with a haematologist. In ITP (p345), steroids ± IV immunoglobulin may be used. Especially in pregnancy (OHCS p88), consult an expert. Is there overdose with anticoagulants (p842)? In haemophiliac bleeds, consult early for coagulation factor replacement. Never give IM injections. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 334466 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH Table 8.3 Clotting screen abnormalities in coagulopathies 347 Disorder INR APTT Thrombin time Platelet count Notes Heparin     DIC    
