(or 10 posteriorly). Hy- perinfl ation can be abnormal, eg COPD. Poor inspiration can mimic cardiomegaly, as the heart is usually pulled down (hence elongated) with inspiration, and crowding of vessels at the lung bases can mimic consolidation or collapse. This is common in patients who are acutely unwell, particularly those in pain or unconscious. Take care in interpreting these images. • Exposure: An under-exposed image will be too white and an over-exposed image will be too black. Both cause a loss of defi nition and quality although some com- pensation can be made with standard viewing software. • Position: The entire lung margin should be visible. Trachea Normally central or just to the right. Deviated by collapse (towards the le- sion), expansion (away from the lesion), or patient rotation. Mediastinum May be: Widened by mediastinal fat; retrosternal thyroid; aortic aneurysm/unfolding; lymph node enlargement (sarcoidosis, lymphoma, metastases, TB); tumour (thymoma, teratoma); cysts (bronchogenic, pericardial); paravertebral mass (TB). Shifted towards a collapsed lung or away from processes that add vol- ume (eg a large mass or a tension pneumothorax). There are three bulges normally visible on the left border of the mediastinum that help identify pathology if abnormal. From superior to
