Randomized to: • immediate ART • deferred ART until CD4 <350 cells/microlitre or AIDS-defi ning illness. Study was terminated early when an independent interim analysis revealed ben- efi t to immediate initiation of ART, and recommended that patients on the deferred group start ART. Immediate initiation of ART reduced the risk of AIDS, serious non-AIDS events, or death by 57% (CI 38–70%) at 3 years. Aims of ART To reduce the HIV viral load to a level undetectable by standard labora- tory techniques leading to immunological recovery, reduced clinical progression, and reduced mortality. These aims should be met with the least possible side-eff ects. Mechanism of action (See fi g 9.13.) • CCR5 antagonists inhibit the entry of the virus into the cell by blocking the CCR5 co-receptor. • Nucleos(t)ide and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs, NNR- TIs) inhibit reverse transcriptase and the conversion of viral RNA into DNA. • Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) inhibit integrase and prevent HIV DNA integrating into the nucleus. • Protease inhibitors (PIs) inhibit protease, an enzyme involved in the maturation of virus particles. • Pharmacokinetic enhancers/boosters increase the eff ectiveness of antiretroviral drugs allowing lower doses eg cobicistat, ritonavir.
