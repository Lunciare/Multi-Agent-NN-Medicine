weight loss occur. Progressive bone destruction leads to vertebral collapse and gibbus (sharply angled spinal curvature). Abscess formation may lead to cord compression, causing paraplegia, and bowel/bladder dysfunction (p466). X- rays: (fi g 15.15) Narrow disc spaces and vertebral osteoporosis, leading to destruc- tion with wedging of vertebrae. Lesions in the thoracic spine often lead to kyphosis. Abscess formation in the lumbar spine may track down to the psoas muscle, and erode through the skin. : Anti-TB drugs (p394).

Fingers or toes ache and change colour: pale (ischaemia) blue (deoxygenation) red (reactive hyperaemia). It may be idiopathic (Raynaud’s disease—prevalence: 3–20%; : >1:1) or have an underlying cause (Raynaud’s phenomenon; fi g 15.16). Tests: Exclude an underlying cause (see BOX ‘Conditions
