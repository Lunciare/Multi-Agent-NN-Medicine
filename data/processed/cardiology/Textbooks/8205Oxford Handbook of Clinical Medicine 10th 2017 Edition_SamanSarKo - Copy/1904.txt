in the detection of free gas and intra-abdominal collections, and allows good visualization of the colon and retroperitoneal areas. Oral or IV contrast medium enhances defi nition (p730). The big disadvantage is the radiation dose. CT colonography (CTC; fi g 16.31) uses rectal air or CO 2 insuffl ation, usually coupled with an oral ‘stool tagging’ agent to visualize the colonic mucosa in those unfi t for endo- scopic evaluation or in whom endoscopic evaluation has failed (eg in a stenosing tu- mour, where it can be used to assess the proximal colon and allow assessment of liver and nodal metastases at the same time). A negative test can be regarded as defi nitive but if polyps or masses are seen then patients will usually require a colonoscopy. Wireless capsule endoscopy: See p248. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) This gives excellent soft tissue imaging, giving it an important role in imaging the liver, biliary system, pancreas, and pancreatic duct (MRCP—magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; fi g 16.32). As well as assessing potential malignant disease, MRCP is the imaging modality of choice for detection of common bile duct stones that can be missed on US. MRI performed after fl uid loading of the small
