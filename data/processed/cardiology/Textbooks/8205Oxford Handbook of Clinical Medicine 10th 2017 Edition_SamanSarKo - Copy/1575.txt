=causes of hepatosplenomegaly. Smooth hepatomegaly Hepatitis, CCF, sarcoidosis, early alcoholic cirrhosis (a small liver is typical later); tricuspid incompetence ( pulsatile liver). Craggy hepatomegaly Secondaries or 1° hepatoma. (Nodular cirrhosis typically causes a small, shrunken liver, not an enlarged craggy one.) Pelvic masses Fibroids, fetus, bladder, ovarian cysts or malignancies. Is it truly pel- vic?—Yes, if by palpation you cannot get ‘below it’. Investigating lumps Check FBC (with fi lm); CRP; U&E; LFT; Ca2+; tumour markers only as appropriate. Imaging by CT or US (transvaginal approach may be useful); MRI also has a role, eg in assessment of liver masses (p286). Others: TB tests (p394). Biopsy to give a tissue diagnosis may be obtained using a fi ne needle guided by CT, US, or endoscopy. 7 Subtract fl uid albumin from serum albumin to obtain serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). Gradient <11g/L suggests malignancy, infections, or pancreatitis. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 660044 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS The fi rst successful laparotomy... 605 In 1809, an American surgeon by the name of Ephraim McDowell performed an astonishing operation: the fi rst successful elective laparotomy for an abdominal tumour.
