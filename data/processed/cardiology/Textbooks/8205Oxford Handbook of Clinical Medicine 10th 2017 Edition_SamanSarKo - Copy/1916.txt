tolerance. When used with CT, the exami- nation is said to be contrast enhanced—look for ‘+ c’ amongst the scan details. Exercise caution in: renal or cardiac impairment; myeloma; diabetes; sickle cell disease; elderly; infants; the acutely unwell. Avoid iodine-based agents in active hyperthyroidism. Have renal function to hand in these patients (see p315). Minor reactions in- clude nausea, vomiting, and a sensation of warmth. More severe reactions in- clude urticaria, bronchospasm, angioedema, and low BP (1:250); theoretical risk of death for 1:150 000. Metformin should be withheld for 48h after IV contrast administration because of the risk of lactic acidosis. Barium sulfate Used in examination of the GI tract. Water-insoluble particles of 0.6–1.4μm diameter are mixed with large organic molecules such as pectin and gum to promote good fl ow, mucosal adherence, and high density in thin layers. Complications: Chemical pneumonitis or peritonitis. Never administer if you sus- pect perforated viscus. Water-soluble, non-ionic, iodine-based contrast agents Used instead of barium where there is a risk of peritoneal contamination (eg fi stula, megacolon, ulceration, diverticulitis, bowel anastomosis, acute intestinal haemorrhage). Gas- trograffi n should not be used. Contains iodine so establish allergy history and thyroid status. Air In CT colonography,
