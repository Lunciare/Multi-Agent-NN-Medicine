>65 • use of medications that can predispose to bleeding (eg NSAIDs, anti-platelets) • alcohol abuse • uncontrolled hypertension • history of, or predisposition to, major bleeding • renal disease • liver disease • stroke history. Pre-excited AF In pre-excited AF, accessory pathways capable of conducting at rapid rates (eg sometimes in WPW syndrome) pass erratic electrical activity from the atria to the ventricles, unfi ltered by the AVN. ECGs will show irregular, broad QRS complexes at >200bpm. Ventricles cannot sustain this rate for long; the patient is at high risk of VT and VF. (a) (b) (c) QRS QRS P P P P Fig 3.35 (a) AF: note the irregular spacing of QRS complexes and lack of P waves. (b) AF with a rapid ventricular response (sometimes referred to as ‘fast AF’). No pattern to QRS complex spacing, and rate >100bpm. (c) Atrial fl utter with 2:1 block (2 P waves for every 1 QRS complex). The P waves have the classic ‘sawtooth’ appearance. Alternate P waves are merged with the QRS complex. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 113311 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 132 Pacemakers In normal circumstances the SAN plays the role of pacemaker.
