pain, BP. Tests Blood: Urea and creatinine; ESR; CRP; anaemia. Ultrasound: Dilated ure- ters (hydronephrosis). CT/MRI: Periaortic mass (fi g 13.50). Biopsy under imaging guidance is used to rule out malignancy. Treatment Retrograde stent placement to relieve obstruction (removed after 12 months) ± ureterolysis (dissection of the ureters from the retroperitoneal tissue). Immunosuppression (in idiopathic RPF) with low-dose steroids has good long-term results.

Epi- demiology: Accounts for 90% of renal cancers; mean age 55yrs. :≈2:1. 15% of haemodialysis patients develop RCC. Features: 50% found incidentally. Haematuria, loin pain, abdominal mass, anorexia, malaise, weight loss, PUO—often in isolation. Rarely, invasion of left renal vein compresses left testicular vein causing a varicocele. Spread may be direct (renal vein), via lymph, or haemat ogenous (bone, liver, lung). 25% have metastases at presentation. Tests: BP: from renin secretion. Blood: FBC (polycythaemia from erythropoietin secretion); ESR; U&E, ALP (bony mets?). Urine:
