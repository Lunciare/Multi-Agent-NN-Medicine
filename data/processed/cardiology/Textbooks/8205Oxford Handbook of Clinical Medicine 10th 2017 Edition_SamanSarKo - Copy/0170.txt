call-to-stool impulses (esp. after meal, ie the gastro-colic refl ex). • Ensure access to latest continence aids and advice on use, refer to continence nurse specialist for assessment. • Pelvic fl oor rehabilitation: eg can help faecal incontinence, squeeze pressure, and maximal tolerated volume. • Loperamide 2–4mg 45min before social engagements may prevent accidents out- side home. An anal cotton plug may help isolated internal sphincter weakness. Skin care. Support agencies. If all sensible measures fail, try a brake-and-accelerator approach: enemas to empty the rectum (twice weekly) and codeine phosphate, eg 15mg/12h, on non-enema days to constipate. It’s not a cure, but makes the incontinence manageable. Flatulence Normally, 400–1300mL of gas is expelled PR in 8–20 discrete (or indiscrete) episodes per day. If this, with any eructation (belching) or distension, seems excessive to the patient, they may complain of fl atulence. Eructation occurs in hiatus hernia—but most patients with ‘fl atulence’ have no GI disease. Air swal lowing (aerophagy) is the main cause of fl atus; here N2 is the chief gas. If fl atus is mostly methane, H2 and CO2, then fermentation by bowel bacteria is the cause, and reducing carbohydrate intake (eg less lactose and wheat) may help.
