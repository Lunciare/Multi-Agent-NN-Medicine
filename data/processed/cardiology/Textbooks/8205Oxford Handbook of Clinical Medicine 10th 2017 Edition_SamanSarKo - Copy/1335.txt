CT 2 First-degree relative withN F2, and either: a) Unilateral vestibular Schwannoma; or b) One of the following: • Neurofi broma • Meningioma • Glioma • Schwannoma • Juvenile cataract (NF2 type). Differential: NF1, Schwannomatosis. Causes of café-au-lait spots: Normal (eg up to 5); NF1 (melanocyte density vs ‘normal’ café-au-lait spots); NF2; rare syndromes: Gaucher’s; McCune–Albright; Russell–Silver; tuberous sclerosis; Wiskott–Aldrich. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 551155 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 516 Syringomyelia A syrinx is a tubular cavity in or close to the central canal of the cervical cord. Mean age of onset: 30yrs. Incidence: 8/100 000/yr. Symptoms may be static for years, but then worsen fast—eg on coughing or sneezing, as pressure causes extension, eg into the brainstem (syringobulbia, see later in topic). Causes Typically, blocked CSF circulation (without 4th ventricular communic- ation), with fl ow from basal posterior fossa to caudal space, eg Arnold–Chiari malformation (cerebellum herniates through foramen magnum); basal arachnoidi- tis (after infection, irradiation, subarachnoid haemorrhage); basilar invagination (in which the top of the odontoid process of C2 migrates upwards, causing fora- men magnum stenosis ± medulla oblongata compression); masses (cysts, rheu- matoid pannus, encephalocoele, tumours). Less commonly, a syrinx may develop after myelitis, cord trauma, or rupture of an AV
