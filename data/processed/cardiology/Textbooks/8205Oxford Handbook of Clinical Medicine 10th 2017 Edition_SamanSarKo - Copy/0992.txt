turning this situation around look dim.’ Dr M Chan, Director-General of WHO, March 2012. Antimicrobial stewardship2 is necessary in all healthcare settings: • monitoring, evaluation, and feedback on antimicrobial prescribing, bench- marked against up-to-date local and national guidelines • evaluation of high/low levels of prescribing and prescribing outside of guidelines • review of patient safety events: avoidable infection, drug reactions, complica- tions of antibiotic therapy, eg MRSA (p388), C. diffi cile (p259, p411) • education and decision support systems for all antibiotic prescribers • antibiotic pack sizes that correspond to appropriate course lengths • regular review of all antimicrobial policy, treatment, and prophylaxis guidelines. 1 Clinical diagnosis of low-severity community-acquired pneumonia is an exception, see also UTI p296. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 338844 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI Inhibitors of cell wall synthesis 385 See fi g 9.4. The bacterial cell wall is unique in nature and therefore acts as a selective target for antibiotics. Antibiotics which act on the cell wall include: • -lactam antibiotics • others: glycopeptides, polymyxins. -lactams: penicillins, cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam Contain a -lactam ring which inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-links in the bacterial cell wall. Resistance occurs when the bacteria (eg staphylococci) produce a -lactamase enzyme. Penicillins: See
