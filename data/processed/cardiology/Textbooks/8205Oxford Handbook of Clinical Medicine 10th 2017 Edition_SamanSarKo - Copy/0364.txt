there is little risk of signifi - cant hyperkalaemia, even when given with ACE-i. Nevertheless, U&E should be monitored, particularly if the patient has known CKD. Eplerenone is an alterna- tive if spironolactone is not tolerated. 5 Digoxin: Helps symptoms even in those with sinus rhythm, and should be con- sidered for patients with LVSD who have signs or symptoms of heart failure while receiving standard therapy, including ACE-i and -blockers, or in patients with AF. Dose example: 125mcg/24h PO if sinus rhythm. Monitor U&E; maintain K+ at 4–5mmol/L as K+ risks digoxin toxicity, and vice versa. Digoxin levels: p756. Other inotropes are unhelpful in terms of outcome. 6 Vasodilators: The combination of hydralazine (SE: drug-induced lupus) and isosorbide dinitrate should be used if intolerant of ACE-i and ARBS as it reduces mortality. It also reduces mortality when added to standard therapy (including ACE-i) in black patients with heart failure. 41 Intractable heart failure Reassess the cause. Are they taking the drugs?—at maxi- mum dose? Switching furosemide to bumetanide (one 5mg tab≈200mg furos emide) might help. Inpatient management may include: • Minimal exertion; Na+ & fl uid restriction (1.5L/24h PO). • Metolazone (as above) and IV furosemide (p800). • Opiates
