Causes: MND, Guillain–Barré, polio, myasthenia gravis, syringo bulbia (p516), brainstem tumours, central pontine myelinolysis (p672). Corticobulbar palsy UMN lesion of muscles of swallowing and talking due to bilateral lesions above the mid-pons, eg corticobulbar tracts (MS, MND, stroke, cen- tral pontine myelinolysis). It is commoner than bulbar palsy. Signs: Slow tongue movements, with slow deliberate speech; jaw jerk; pharyngeal and palatal re- fl exes; pseudobulbar aff ect (PBA)—weeping unprovoked by sorrow or mood-incon- gruent giggling (emotional incontinence without mood change is also seen in MS, Wilson’s, and Parkinson’s disease, dementia, nitrous oxide use, and head injury). In some countries, dextromethorphan + quinidine is licensed for PBA. Revised El Escorial diagnostic criteria for ALS Defi nite Lower + upper motor neuron signs in 3 regions.
