eg on ultrasound that cannot be attributed to other causes (most commonly alcohol so consider NAFLD if drink <18U/wk, <9U). If infl ammation is also present (LFT, typically ALT) = non-al- coholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Rule out other causes of liver disease (p284) and check for associated metabolic disorders (obesity, dyslipidaemia, diabetes, hypertension). Progression to cirrhosis may occur—biopsy or elastography may be needed (p248). Risk factors for progression Older age; obesity; DM; NASH. Treatment Control risk factors, including obesity (bariatic surgery helps). Address cardiovascular risk (com- monest cause of death, see p93). Avoid alcohol consumption. No drug is of proven benefi t, though vitamin E may improve histology in fi brosis (eg 400IU/d—higher doses associated with excess mortality). Follow-up Monitor for complications (NASH, cir- rhosis, DM). If cirrhotic, screen for HCC with ultrasound ± AFP twice-yearly. Wilson’s disease/hepatolenticular degeneration Wilson’s disease is a rare (3/100 000) inherited disorder of copper excretion with excess deposition in liver and CNS (eg basal ganglia). It is treatable, so screen all with cirrhosis. Genetics An autosomal recessive disorder of a copper transporting ATPase, ATP7B. Physiology Total body copper content is ~125mg. Intake ≈ 3mg/day (absorbed in proximal small intestine). In the liver, copper is incorporated
