Most patients are elderly and do not complain of, or feel, cold—so they have not tried to warm up. In the young, hypothermia is usually from cold exposure (eg near-drowning), or is secondary to impaired consciousness (eg following excess alcohol or drug overdose). Defi nition Hypothermia implies a core (rectal) temperature <35°C. Causes In the elderly, hypothermia is often caused by a combination of factors: • Impaired homeostatic mechanisms: usually age-related. • Low room temperature: poverty, poor housing. • Impaired thermoregulation: pneumonia, MI, heart failure. • Reduced metabolism: immobility, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus. • Autonomic neuropathy (p505); eg diabetes mellitus, Parkinson’s. • Excess heat loss: psoriasis and any other widespread dermatological diseases (ie TEN/ erythrodermic eczema). • Cold awareness: dementia, confusion. • Increased exposure to cold: falls, especially at night
