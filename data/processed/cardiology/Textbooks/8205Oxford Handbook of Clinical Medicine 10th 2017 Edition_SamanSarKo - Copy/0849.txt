p342. 3 Sideroblastic anaemia (very rare): p326. NB: there is iron accumulation in the last two conditions, and so tests will show in- creased serum iron and ferritin with a low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). Normal MCV (normocytic anaemia): 1 Acute blood loss. 5 Hypothyroidism (or MCV). 2 Anaemia of chronic disease (or MCV). 6 Haemolysis (or MCV). 3 Bone marrow failure. 7 Pregnancy. 4 Renal failure. NB: if wcc or platelet in normocytic anaemia, suspect marrow failure: see p364. High MCV (macrocytic anaemia): 1 B12 or folate defi ciency. 5 Myelodysplastic syndromes. 2 Alcohol excess—or liver disease. 6 Marrow infi ltration. 3 Reticulocytosis (p328, eg with haemolysis). 7 Hypothyroidism. 4 Cytotoxics, eg hydroxycarbamide. 8 Antifolate drugs (eg phenytoin). Haemolytic anaemias: These do not fi t into the above-mentioned classifi cation as the anaemia may be normocytic or, if there are many young (hence larger) RBCS and reticulocytes, macrocytic (p332). Suspect if there is a reticulo cytosis (>2% of RBCS; or reticu locyte count >100≈109/L), mild macroc ytosis, haptoglobin, bilirubin, LDH, or urobilinogen. These patients will often be mildly jaundiced (but note that haemolysis causes pre-hepatic jaundice so there will be no bilirubin in their urine). Does the patient need
