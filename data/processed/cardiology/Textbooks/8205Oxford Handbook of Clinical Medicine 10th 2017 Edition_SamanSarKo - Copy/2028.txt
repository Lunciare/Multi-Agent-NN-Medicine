Release of histamine and other agents causes: capillary leak; wheeze; cyanosis; oedema (larynx, lids, tongue, lips); urticaria. More common in atopic individuals. An anaphylactoid reaction results from direct release of mediators from infl ammatory cells, without involving antibodies, usually in response to a drug, eg acetylcysteine. Examples of precipitants • Drugs, eg penicillin, and contrast media in radiology. • Latex. • Stings, eggs, fi sh, peanuts, strawberries, semen (rare). Signs and symptoms • Itching, sweating, diarrhoea and vomiting, erythema, urticaria, oedema. • Wheeze, laryngeal obstruction, cyanosis. • Tachycardia, hypotension. Mimics of anaphylaxis • Carcinoid (p271). • Phaeochromocytoma (p228, p837). • Systemic mastocytosis. • Hereditary angioedema.
