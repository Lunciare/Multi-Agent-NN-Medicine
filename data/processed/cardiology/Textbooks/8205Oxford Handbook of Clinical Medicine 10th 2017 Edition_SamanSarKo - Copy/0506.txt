the lung parenchyma in a diff use manner.58 They are characterized by chronic infl ammation and/or progressive interstitial fi brosis (table 4.11), and share a number of clinical and pathological features. See table 4.11 and fi g 4.19. Clinical features Dyspnoea on exertion; non-productive paroxysmal cough; ab- normal breath sounds; abnormal CXR or high-resolution CT; restrictive pulmonary spirometry with DLCO (p164). Pathological features Fibrosis and remodelling of the interstitium; chronic infl am- mation; hyperplasia of type II epithelial cells or type II pneumocytes. Classifi cation The ILDS can be broadly grouped into three categories: Those with known cause, eg: • Occupational/environmental, eg asbestosis, berylliosis, silicosis, cotton worker’s lung (byssinosis). • Drugs, eg nitrofurantoin, bleomycin, amiodarone, sulfasalazine, busulfan. • Hypersensitivity reactions, eg hypersensitivity pneumonitis. • Infections, eg TB, fungi, viral. • Gastro-oesophageal refl ux. Those associated with systemic disorders, eg: • Sarcoidosis. • Rheumatoid arthritis. • SLE, systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjögren’s syndrome. • Ulcerative colitis, renal tubular acidosis, autoimmune thyroid disease. Idiopathic, eg: • Idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis (IPF, p200). • Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia. • Non-specifi c interstitial pneumonitis. Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA) In sensitized individuals, repetitive inhalation of allergens (fungal spores or avian proteins) provokes a hypersensitivity
