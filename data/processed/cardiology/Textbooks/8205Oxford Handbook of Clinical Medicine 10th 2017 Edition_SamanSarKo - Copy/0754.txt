process that is also induced by cigarette smoking (p184). Prevalence ~1:4000 (higher in Caucasians). Genetics Genetic variants of A1AT are typed by electro phor etic mobility as medium (M), slow (S), or very slow (Z). S and Z types are due to single amino acid substitutions at positions 264 and 342, respectively. These result in production of 1-antitrypsin (S=60%, Z=15%). The normal genotype is PiMM, the high risk homozygote is PiZZ; het- erozygotes are PiMZ and PiSZ (at low risk of developing liver disease). The patient Symptomatic patients usually have the PiZZ genotype: dyspnoea from emphysema; cirrhosis; cholestatic jaundice. Cholestasis often remits in adolescence. Tests Serum 1-antitrypsin (1AT) levels , usually (eg <11μmol/L or <75% of lower limit of normal, which is ~0.9g/L; labs vary). Note the ‘usually’. Because A1AT is part of the acute-phase response, infl ammation may hide a low level. Unless you do genotyp- ing, you will inevitably mis-label some cirrhosis as cryptogenic. Lung function testing: Shows reductions in FEV1 with obstructive pattern (p162). There may be some bronch- dilator reversibility. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) Periodic acid Schiff (PAS) +ve; diastase-re- sistant globules. Phenotyping: By isoelectric focusing requires expertise to distinguish SZ and ZZ phenotypes. Phenotyping can
