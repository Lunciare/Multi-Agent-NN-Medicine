nitrates and diu- retics). Monitor BP carefully, and assess early signs of pulmonary oedema. Intensive monitoring and inotropes may be useful in some patients.  Reperfusion therapy Early coronary reperfusion saves lives; decisions must be taken quickly so seek senior advice early. Look for typical clinical symptoms of MI plus ECG criteria: • ST elevation >1mm in ≥2 adjacent limb leads or >2mm in ≥2 adjacent chest leads. • LBBB (unless known to have LBBB previously). • Posterior changes: deep ST depression and tall R waves in leads V1 to V3. Therapy may be percutaneous intervention (PCI—with angiographic identifi cation of the culprit blockage(s) and revascularization via deployment of an expandable met- al stent) or thrombolysis (with systemically administered clot-dissolving enzymes): • Primary PCI: Should be off ered to all patients presenting within 12h of symptom onset with a STEMI who either are at or can be transferred to a primary PCI cen- tre within 120min of fi rst medical contact. If this is not possible, patients should receive thrombolysis and be transferred to a primary PCI centre after the infusion for either rescue PCI (if residual ST elevation) or angiography (if successful). Use beyond 12h if evidence of ongoing
