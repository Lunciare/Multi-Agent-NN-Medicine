If diagnosis is uncertain, re-examine often. A normal appendix is removed in up to 20% of patients. Treatment Prompt appendicectomy (fi g 13.27). Antibiotics: piperacillin/tazobac- tam 4.5g/8h, 1 to 3 doses IV starting 1h pre-op, reduces wound infections. Give a long- er course if perforated. Laparoscopy: Has dia gnostic and therapeutic advantages (if surgeon experienced), especially in women and the obese. It is not recommended in cases of suspected gangrenous perf or ation as the rate of abscess formation may be higher. Complications • Perforation is commoner if a faecolith is present and in young children,as the diagnosis is more often delayed. • Appendix mass may result when an infl amed appendix becomes covered with omen- tum. US/CT may help with diagnosis. Some advocate early surgery. Alternatively, initial conservative management—NBM and antibiotics. If the mass resolves, some perform an interval (ie delayed) appendicectomy. Exclude a colonic tumour (lapa- rotomy or colonoscopy), which can present as early as the 4th
