the open probability of CFTR channels and has been shown to improve clinical outcomes (lung function, weight, lung disease stability) in CF patients >6 years old.19 Lumacaftor is a CFTR corrector, and has been shown to correct F508 del CFTR misprocessing and increase the amount of cell surface–localized protein. Ivacaftor and lumacaftor combination therapy, for patients with F508 del, have shown improved lung function and reduced pulmonary exacerations.20 Gene therapy (transfer of CFTR gene using liposome or adenovirus vectors): phase 2b studies show modest but signifi cant improvement in FEV1 in those receiv- ing gene therapy.21 Further work into vectors for gene transfer is ongoing. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 117733 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem tsehC 174 Lung tumours Carcinoma of the bronchus Second most common cancer in the UK, accounting for 13% of all new cancer cases and 27% of cancer deaths (40 000 cases/yr in UK).22 Incidence is increasing in women. Only 5% ‘cured’. Risk factors: Cigarette smoking (causes 90% of lung ca). Others: passive smoking, asbestos, chromium, arsenic, iron oxides, and radiation (radon gas). Histology: Clinically the most important division is between small cell (SCLC) and non-small cell (NSCLC). NSCLC: Squamous (35%); adenocarcinoma (27%), large cell (10%); adenocarcinoma in situ (rare, <1%).
