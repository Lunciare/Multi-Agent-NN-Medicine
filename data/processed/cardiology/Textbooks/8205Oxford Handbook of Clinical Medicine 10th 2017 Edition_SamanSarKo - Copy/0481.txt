outcome. • Circulatory support: Invasive haemodynamic monitoring with an arterial line and Swan–Ganz catheter aids the diagnosis and may be helpful in monitoring PCWP and cardiac output. A conservative fl uid management approach improves outcome. Maintain cardiac output and O2 delivery with inotropes (eg dobutamine 2.5–10mcg/ kg/min IVI), vasodilators, and blood transfusion. Consider treating pulmonary hyper- tension with low-dose (20–120 parts per million) nitric oxide, a pulmonary vasodila- tor. Haemo fi ltration may be needed in renal failure and to achieve a negative fl uid balance. 46, 49 • Sepsis: Identify organism(s) and treat. If septic, but no organisms cultured, use empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics (p167). Avoid nephrotoxic antibiotics. • Other: Nutritional support: enteral is best: p584 & p586, with high-fat, antioxidant formulations. Steroids protect those at risk of fat embolization and with pneumo- cystosis and may improve outcome in subacute ARDS. Their role in established ARDS is controversial. 50, 51 Prognosis Overall mortality is 50–75%. Prognosis varies with age of patient, cause (pneumonia 86%, trauma 38%), and number of organs involved (three organs in- volved for >1wk is ‘invariably’ fatal). Risk factors for ARDS • Sepsis • Massive transfusion • Hypovolaemic shock • Burns (p846) • Trauma • Smoke inhalation
