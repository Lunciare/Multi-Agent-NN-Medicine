progressive vision loss ‘like a curtain descending’. Global events (eg syncope, dizziness) are not typical of TIAs. At- tacks may be single or many; multiple highly stereotyped attacks (‘crescendo’ TIAs) suggest a critical intra cranial stenosis (commonly the superior division of the MCA). Causes (See p470.) • Atherothromboembolism from the carotid is the chief cause: listen for bruits (though not a sensitive test). • Cardioembolism: mural thrombus post-MI or in AF, valve disease, prosthetic valve (p473). • Hyperviscosity: eg poly- cythaemia, sickle-cell anaemia, myeloma. • Vasculitis is a rare, non-embolic cause of TIA symptoms (eg cranial arteritis, PAN, SLE, syphilis, etc.). Diff erentials Hypoglycaemia, migraine aura (p458), focal epilepsy (symptoms spread over seconds and often include twitching and jerking), hyperventilation, reti- nal bleeds. Rare mimics of TIA: Malignant hypertension, MS (paroxysmal dysarthria), intra cranial tumours, peripheral neuropathy, phaeochromocytoma, somatization. Tests FBC, ESR, U&Es, glucose, lipids, CXR, ECG, carotid Doppler ± angiography, CT or diff usion-weighted MRI, echoc ardio gram. Treatment • Control cardiov ascular risk factors: Optimize: BP (cautiously lower; aim for <140/85mmHg, p140); hyperlipidaemia (p690); DM (p206); help to stop smoking (p93). • Antiplatelet drugs: As with stroke, give aspirin 300mg OD for 2wks, then switch to clopidogrel 75mg
