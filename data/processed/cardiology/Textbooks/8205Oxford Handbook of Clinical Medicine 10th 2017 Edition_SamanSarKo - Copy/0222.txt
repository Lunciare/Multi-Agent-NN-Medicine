• Dupuytren’s contracture (see fi g 2.26, p60) fi brosis and contrac ture of palmar fascia, p698) is seen in liver disease, trauma, epilepsy, and ageing. • Look for Heberden’s (DIP) fi g 2.45 and Bouchard’s (PIP) ‘nodes’—osteophytes (bone over-growth at a joint) seen with osteoarthritis.

Clubbing Fingernails (± toenails) have increased curvature in all directions and loss of the angle between nail and nail fold and feel boggy (fi gs 2.46, 2.47). Pathogenesis is unclear although the platelet theory was developed in 1987.16 Megakaryocytes are normally fragmented into platelets in the lungs, and the original theory was that any disruption to normal pulmonary circulation (infl ammation, cancer, cardiac right-to-left shunting) would allow large megakaryocytes into the systemic cir- culation. They become lodged in the capillaries of the fi ngers and toes, releasing platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, which lead to tissue growth, vascular permeability, and recruitment of infl ammatory cells. Evidence showing platelet microthrombi in clubbed fi ngers, and high levels of PDGF and VEGF in patients with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, support the theory. This does
