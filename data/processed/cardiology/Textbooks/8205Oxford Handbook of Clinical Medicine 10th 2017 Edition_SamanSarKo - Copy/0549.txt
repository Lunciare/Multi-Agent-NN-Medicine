(123Iodine, 99technetium pertechnetate, etc; see fi g 13.22, p601.) Useful for determining the cause of hyperthyroidism and to detect retrosternal goitre, ec- topic thyroid tissue or thyroid metastases (+ whole body CT). If there are suspicious nodules, the question is: does the area have increased (hot), decreased (cold), or the same (neutral) uptake of isotope as the remaining thyroid (see fi g 5.13). Few neu- tral and almost no hot nodules are malignant. 20% of ‘cold’ nodules are malignant. Surgery is most likely to be needed if: •rapid growth •compression signs •dominant nodule on scintigraphy •nodule 3cm •hypo-echogenicity.
