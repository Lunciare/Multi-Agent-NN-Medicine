fi rst question to ask and depends on recognizing characteristic patterns of cognitive, cranial nerve, motor, and sensory defi cits. Locating a focal le- sion can be aided by features such as asymmetry (eg one pupil dilated, one upgoing plantar response) or a spinal level (eff ects may be symmetrical below the lesion). Note that sometimes there is no single lesion, rather, a general insult causing a falsely localizing sign, eg abducens nerve palsy in ICP. Other generalized causes of specifi c local eff ects are: trauma,encephalitis, anoxia,poisoning,or post-ictal states. Patterns of loss Are crucial in locating the lesion (see BOX ‘From fi ndings to neu- roanatomy’): Upper motor neuron (UMN): Patterns of weakness are caused by damage anywhere along the corticospinal (=pyramidal) tracts: pathways that carry motor information from the precentral gyrus of the frontal cortex up to the synapse with anterior horn cells in the spinal cord (via the internal capsule, brainstem, and cord).1 •UMN weakness aff ects groups rather than individual muscles, typically in a ‘pyramidal’ pattern: in the arm, extensors are predominantly aff ected; in the leg the opposite is true and the fl exors are the weaker muscle group. •Spasticity develops in the stronger muscle
