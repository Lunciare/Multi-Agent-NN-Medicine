the right posterior hepatic notch are more frequent in alcoholic cirrhosis than in virus-induced cirrhosis. Ascitic tap: Should be performed and fl uid sent for urgent MC&S—neutrophils >250/mm3 indicates spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (see later in topic for treatment). Liver biopsy: (See p248.) Confi rms the clinical diagnosis. Management General: Good nutrition is vital. Alcohol abstinence (p280). Avoid NSAIDS, sedatives, and opiates. Colestyramine helps pruritus (4g/12h PO, 1h after other drugs). Consider ultrasound ± -fetoprotein every 6 months to screen for HCC (p286) in those where this information will change management. Specifi c: For hepatitis-induced cirrhosis see p278. High-dose ursodeoxycholic acid in PBC (p282) may improve LFT and improve transplant-free survival. Penicillamine for Wilson’s disease (p285). Ascites: Fluid restriction (<1.5L/d), low-salt diet (40–100mmol/d). Give spironolactone 100mg/24h PO; dose as tolerated (max 400mg/24h)—it coun- ters deranged renin–angiotensin–aldosterone (RAA) axis. Chart daily weight and aim for weight loss of ≤½kg/d. If response is poor, add furosemide ≤120mg/24h PO; do U&E (watch Na+) often. Therapeutic paracentesis with concomitant albumin infusion (6–8g/L fl uid removed) may be required. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Must be considered in any patient with ascites who deteriorates suddenly (may be asymptomatic). Common organisms are E. coli, Klebsiella, and streptococci. :
