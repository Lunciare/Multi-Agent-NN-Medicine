global concern about a ‘swine fl u’ pandemic. Based on a Cochrane review in 2008, which showed reduced complications with os- eltamivir, billions were spent stockpiling the drug worldwide. In fact, the positive conclusion was driven mainly by data from an industry-funded summary of 10 trials, of which only two had been published.5 Cochrane needed ac- cess to these missing data. The ensuing fi ght for information was to take 5 years. The off er of a secret contract, with secret terms, and secrecy about methods, was declined. These are not acceptable methods for meta-analysis. Inconsistencies be- gan to arise in conclusions about eff ectiveness. Were people seeing diff erent data, or was this simply a close call with two sides separated by a very small fence? Either way, being able to see all the data started to become increasingly important. But even the largest phase three trial of the drug had never been published. And was self-reported pneumonia a useful outcome measure? In December 2009, Cochrane could only declare that paucity of data undermined previous fi ndings. This battle for data became part of ‘Alltrials’: a campaign for transparency in clinical trials. ~50% of all clinical trials remain unpublished.
