Handbook of Clinical medicine

exercise, palpitations, or emotion suggests cardiac pain or anxiety; if brought on by food, lying fl at, hot drinks, or alcohol, con- sider oesophageal spasm/disease (but meals can also cause angina). Relieving factors: If pain is relieved within minutes by rest or glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), suspect angina (GTN relieves oesophageal spasm more slowly). If antacids help, suspect GI causes. Pericarditic pain improves on leaning forward. Associations: Dyspnoea occurs with cardiac pain, pulmonary emboli, pleurisy, or anxiety. MI may cause nausea, vomiting, or sweating. Angina is caused by coronary artery disease—and also by aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomy opathy (HCM), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT)—and can be exacerbated by anae- mia. Chest pain with tenderness suggests self-limiting Tietze’s syndrome. 1 Odd neu- rological symptoms and atypical chest pain—think aortic dissection. Pleuritic pain: Pain exacerbated by inspiration. Implies infl ammation of the pleura from pulmonary infection, infl ammation, or infarction. It causes us to ‘catch our breath’. : musculoskeletal pain;1 fractured rib (pain on respiration, exacerbated by gentle pressure on the sternum); subdiaphragmatic pathology (eg gallstones). Chest pain & acutely unwell (see p784) • Admit • Check pulse, BP in both arms (unequal in aortic dissection p654), JVP, heart sounds; examine legs for DVT
