in situ. See p740. Nuclear imaging Perfusion is assessed at rest and with exercise- or pharmacolog- ically-induced stress. This test is particularly useful for assessing whether myocar- dium distal to a blockage is viable and so whether stenting or CABG will be of value. If hypoperfusion is ‘fi xed’, ie present at rest and under stress, the hypoperfused area is probably scar tissue and so non-viable. If hypoperfusion is ‘reversible’ at rest, the myocardium may benefi t from improved blood supply.
