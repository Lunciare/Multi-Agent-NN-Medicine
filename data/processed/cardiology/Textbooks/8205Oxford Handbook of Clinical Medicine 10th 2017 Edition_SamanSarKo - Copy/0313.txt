Handbook of Clinical medicine

BP. Patient must be in sinus rhythm. Start with 5mg BD (2.5mg in elderly). • Ranolazine: inhibits late Na+ current. Start at 375mg BD. Caution if heart failure, elderly, weight <60kg or prolonged QT interval. • Nicorandil: a K+ channel activator. Start with 5–10mg BD. CI: acute pulmonary oede- ma, severe hypotension, hypovolaemia, LV failure. Revascularization: Considered when optimal medical therapy proves inadequate. • Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI): (p112) a balloon is infl ated inside the stenosed vessel, opening the lumen. A stent is usually inserted to reduce the risk of re-stenosis. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; usually aspirin and clopidogel) is recommended for at least 12 months after stent insertion to reduce the risk of in- stent thrombosis. Specialist advice should be sought regarding antiplatelets if the patient has a high bleeding risk or requires surgery. • CABG: (p123) compared to PCI, patients undergoing CABG are less likely to need re- peat revascularization and those with multivessel disease can expect better out- comes. However, CABG is open heart surgery and so recovery is slower and the patient is left with two large wounds (sternal and vein harvesting). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 111166 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC Investigating patients with ? stable angina 117
