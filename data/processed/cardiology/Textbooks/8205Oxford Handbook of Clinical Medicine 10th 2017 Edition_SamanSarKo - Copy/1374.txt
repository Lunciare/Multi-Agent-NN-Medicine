Tumour markers in diagnosis Tumour markers are insuffi ciently sensitive or specifi c to be diagnostic in isolation. • Many tumour markers are  in several cancers and benign conditions (table 11.4). • Measuring ≥1 tumour marker is unlikely to aid diagnosis unless suspecting a germ cell tumour. • Do not make opportunistic requests for panels of tumour markers in patients with non-specifi c symptoms: they are not helpful and lead to potentially unnecessary investigation. This includes testing PSA in women and CA 125 in men. • In carefully selected patients, in whom cancer is suspected, highly raised levels of a tumour marker may be helpful: • -fetoprotein (FP) and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in testicular/ germ cell tumours. • CA 125 in combination with USS and menopausal status. • FPin those at high risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. • PSA >100ng/mL usually indicates metastatic prostate cancer. Tumour markers in monitoring The main value of tumour markers is in monitoring patients known to have cancer. This includes the course
