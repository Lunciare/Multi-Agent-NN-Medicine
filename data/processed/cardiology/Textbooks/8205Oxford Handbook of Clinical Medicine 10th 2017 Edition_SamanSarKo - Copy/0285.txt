lead by lead, both in terms of what is ‘normal’ and in what a change indicates. For example, ST eleva- tion in leads II, III, and aVF suggests an inferior MI requiring immediate treatment, likely PCI to the right coronary artery, see table 3.2. ST elevation across all leads, however, suggests instead pericarditis which necessitates entirely diff erent man- agement (p154). An R wave taller than the S is deep (R dominance) is normal in V5 and V6 but may suggest right ventricular strain or posterior MI if seen in V1 and V2.

Instead, you may fi nd these changes but ‘upside-down’ in V1–V3: prominent R waves, fl at ST depression, and T-wave inver- sion. If you record V7–V9 leads, you may fi nd the classic ST elevation pattern and so confi rm posterior MI. See fi g 3.24. The ‘upside-down’
