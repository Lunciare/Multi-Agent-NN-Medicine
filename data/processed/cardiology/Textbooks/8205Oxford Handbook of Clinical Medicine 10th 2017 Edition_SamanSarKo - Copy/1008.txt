fl ora. Pathogenic forms can cause: Intestinal disease: Enterotoxigenic: a major cause of traveller’s diarrhoea (pp428–9). Enterohaemorrhagic: diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis eg O157:H7 (p431). Enteropathogenic: infants in areas of poor sanitation. Enteroinvasive: dysentery-like syndrome. Enteroadherent: traveller’s diarrhoea, chronic diarrhoea in children/HIV. Extra-intestinal disease: usually patient’s own fl ora that is not pathogenic in the intestine but causes disease elsewhere: UTI (pp296–7); neonatal meningitis; noso- comial infection: pneumonia, meningitis, sepsis. Treat according to sensitivity: trimethoprim, ampicillin, cephalosporin, ciprofl oxacin, aminoglycoside. 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae: colonizes skin, nasopharynx, GI tract, hospitalized patients. Associated with antibiotic exposure, in-dwelling catheters, immuno- suppression. Causes pneumonia (necrotizing disease and sepsis if immunosup- pressed). Also UTI, nasopharyngeal infl ammation. Treat according to sensitivity: aminoglycoside, cephalosporin, carbapenem, quinolone. 3 Proteus mirabilis: gut commensal. Causes UTI (pp296–7). Stone formation due to urease production: breaks down urea to produce ammonia, struvite stones (‘infection stones’) then form in the presence of magnesium, calcium, and phos- phate (pp638–9). Other Enterobacteriaceae include Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia: see enteric fever (p415), gastroenteritis (pp428–31), plague (p425). Resistance: widespread antibiotic use has led to the development of highly virulent, multiple resistant E. coli and Klebsiella species including: • extended-spectrum -lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae. Resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins, fl uoroquinolones,
