If hypoxic despite oxygen, consider CPAP to recruit lung paren- chyma and improve oxygenation. But if patient is hypercapnic, they will require non-invasive or invasive (ie intubation) ventilation Discuss with ICU early if patient has rising PaCO2 or remains hypoxic despite best medical therapy Fig 19.15 Management of pneumonia. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 881177 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 818 Pulmonary embolism (PE) Always suspect pulmonary embolism (PE) in sudden collapse 1–2wks after surgery. Mechanism Venous thrombi, usually from DVT, pass into the pulmonary circula- tion and block blood fl ow to lungs. The source is often occult. Risk factors • Malignancy; myeloproliferative disorder; antiphospholipid syndrome. • Surgery—especially pelvic and lower limb (much lower if prophylaxis used). • Immobility;
