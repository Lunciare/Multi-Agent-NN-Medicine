Mantoux test. Intradermal injection of purifi ed protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin. Size of skin induration is used to determine positivity depending on vaccination history and immune status (>5mm if risk factors, >15mm if no risk factors). • Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAS) diagnose exposure to TB by meas- uring the release of interferon-gamma from T-cells reacting to TB antigen. Specifi city compared to TST if history of BCG vaccination. Neither test can diagnose or exclude active disease (falsely negative in 20–25% of active disease): clinical evaluation is required. Immune-suppressed states reduce the sensitivity of both tests. Active pulmonary TB: • CXR. Fibronodular/linear opacities in upper lobe (typical), middle or lower lobes (atypical), cavitation, calcifi cation, miliary disease (see fi g 9.9), eff usion, lym- phadenopathy. • Sputum smear. Sputum can be spontaneously produced or induced (with nebu- lized saline and precautions to prevent transmission). Three specimens are need- ed including an early-morning sample. It is stained for the presence of acid-fast bacilli (AFB). All mycobacteria are ‘acid-fast’ including M. tuberculosis. If AFB are seen, treatment should be commenced and the patient isolated (in hospital only if clinical indication, or public health reason for admission; or at home). • Sputum culture. More
