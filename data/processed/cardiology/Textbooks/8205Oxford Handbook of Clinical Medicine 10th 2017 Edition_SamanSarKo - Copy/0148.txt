Table 2.6 Respiratory causes of haemoptysis. 1 Infective TB; bronchiectasis; bronchitis; pneumonia; lung abscess; COPD; fungi (eg aspergillosis); viruses (from pneumonitis, cryo globulinaemia, eg with hepatitis viruses, HIV-associ- ated pneumocystosis, or MAI, p400). Helminths: paragon- imiasis; hydatid (p435); schistosomiasis. 2 Neoplastic Primary or secondary. 3 Vascular Lung infarction (PE); vasculitis (ANCA-associated; RA; SLE); hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia; AV malforma- tion; capillaritis. 4 Parenchymal Diff use interstitial fi brosis; sarcoidosis; haemoside rosis; Goodpasture’s syndrome; cystic fi brosis. 5 Pulmonary Idiopathic, thromboembolic, congenital cyanotic heart hypertension disease (p156), pulmonary fi brosis, bronchiectasis. 6 Coagulopathies Any—eg thrombocytopenia, p344; DIC; warfarin excess. 7 Trauma/foreign body Eg post-intubation, or an eroding implanted defi brillator. 8 Pseudo-haemoptysis Munchausen’s (p706); aspirated haematemesis; red pig ment (prodigiosin) from Serratia marcescens (Gram-negative bacteria) in sputum.7 Rare causes refuse to be classifi ed neatly: vascular causes may have infective origins, eg hydatid cyst may count as a foreign body, and infection, and vascular if it fi stulates with the aorta; ditto
