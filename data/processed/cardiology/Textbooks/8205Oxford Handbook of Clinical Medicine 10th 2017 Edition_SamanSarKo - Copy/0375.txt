is needed. Treatment goal <140/90mmHg (<130/80 in diabetes, 150/90 if aged >80). Reduce blood pressure slowly; rapid reduction can be fatal, especially in the context of an acute stroke. These may fall—SPRINT49 showed a target of 120/80 was benefi cial. Lifestyle changes Concomitant risk factors: stop smoking; low-fat diet. Reduce alcohol and salt intake; increase exercise; reduce weight if obese. Drugs The ALLHAT study suggests that adequate BP reduction is more important than the specifi c drug used. 50 However, -blockers seem to be less eff ective than other drugs at reducing major cardiovascular events, particularly stroke. -blockers and thiazides may increase the risk of new-onset diabetes, Ca2+-channel blockers appear neutral, and ACE-i or ARB may reduce the risk. 44 Monotherapy: If ≥55yrs, and in black patients of any age, 1st choice is a Ca2+-channel antagonist or thiazide. If <55, 1st choice is ACE-i (or ARB if ACE-i intolerant, eg cough). -blockers are not 1st line for hypertension, but consider in younger people, particu- larly if: intolerance or contraindication to ACE-i/ARB, she is a woman of child-bearing potential, or there is sympathetic drive. Combination : ACE-i + Ca2+-channel antagonist or diuretic is logical, and has been commonly used in trials.
