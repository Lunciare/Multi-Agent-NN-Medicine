rarely needed Stage 2 Walled off or pelvic abscess May resolve without surgery Stage 3 Generalized purulent peritonitis Surgery required Stage 4 Generalized faecal peritonitis Surgery required Indications for elective surgery include stenosis, fi stulae, or recurrent bleeding. Complications Perforation: There is ileus, peritonitis ± shock. Mortality: 40%. Manage as for an acute abdomen. At laparotomy a Hartmann’s procedure may be performed (p582). Primary anastomosis is possible in selected patients. Emergency laparoscopic management is an emerging alternative. • Haemorrhage is usually sudden and painless. It is a common cause of big rectal bleeds (p629). Embolization (at angiography) or colonic resection only necessary if ongoing massive bleeding and colonoscopic haemostasis has been unsuccessful. • Fistulae: Enterocolic, colovaginal, or colovesical (pneumaturia ± intractable UTIS). Treatment is surgical, eg colonic resection. • Abscesses, eg with swinging fever, leucocytosis, and localizing signs, eg boggy rectal mass (pelvic abscess—drain rectally). If no localizing signs, remember the aphorism: pus somewhere, pus nowhere = pus under the diaphragm. A sub- phrenic abscess is a horrible way to die, so do an urgent ultrasound. Antibiotics ± ultrasound/CT-guided drainage may be needed. • Post-infective strictures may form in the sigmoid colon. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 662288 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Rectal bleeding—an acute
