re-enablement • Watch the patient swallow a small volume of water; if signs of aspiration (a cough or voice change) make nil by mouth until formal assessment by a speech therapist. Use IV fl uids, then semi-solids (eg jelly; avoid soups and crumbly food). Avoid early NG tube feeds; these may be needed to safeguard nutrition in those with swallowing problems that persist beyond the fi rst 2–3d. If swallowing fails to recover, consider benefi ts of enteral feeding tube placement (p759). Speech therapists skilled in assess- ing swallowing diffi culties are invaluable here. • Avoid further injury: minimize falls risk and take care when lifting the patient not to damage their shoulders. • Ensure good bladder and bowel care through frequent toileting. Avoid early cath- eterization which may prevent return to continence. • Position to minimize spasticity (occurs in ~40%). Get prompt physiotherapy. Splints and botulinum toxin injections are helpful for focal spasticity. • Monitor progress: eg measure time taken to sit up and transfer to chair. • Monitor mood: in pseudo-emotionalism/emotional lability (sobbing unprovoked by sorrow, from failure of cortical inhibition of the limbic system), tricyclics or fl uoxetine may help. • Engage the patient in their own
