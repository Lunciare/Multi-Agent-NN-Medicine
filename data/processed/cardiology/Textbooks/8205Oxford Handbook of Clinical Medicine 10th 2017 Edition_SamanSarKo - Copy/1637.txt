vascular cushions protrude through a tight anus, become more congested, and hypertrophy to protrude again more readily. These protrusions may then strangulate. See table 13.15 for classifi cation. Symptoms Bright red rectal bleeding, often coating stools, on the tissue, or drip- ping into the pan after defecation. There may be mucous discharge and pruritus ani. Severe anaemia may occur. Symptoms such as weight loss, tenesmus, and change in bowel habit should prompt thoughts of other pathology. In all rectal bleeding do: • An abdominal examination to rule out other diseases. • PR exam: prolapsing piles are obvious. Internal haemorrhoids are not palpable. • Colonoscopy/fl exible sigmoidoscopy to exclude proximal pathology if 50 years old. Treatment 1 Medical: (1st-degree.) Fluid and fibre is key ± topical analgesics & stool softener (bulk forming). Topical steroids for short periods only. 2 Non-operative: (2nd & 3rd degree, or 1st degree if medical therapy failed.) •Rubber band ligation. Cheap, but needs skill. Banding produces an ulcer to anchor the mu- cosa (SE: bleeding, infection; pain). It has the lowest recurrence rate. •Sclerosants. (1st- or 2nd-degree.) 2mL of 5% phenol in oil is injected into the pile above the den- tate line, inducing fi brotic reaction.
