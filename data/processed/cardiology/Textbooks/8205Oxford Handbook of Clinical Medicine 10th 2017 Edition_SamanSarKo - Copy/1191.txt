coryza (p406). The pain lasts ~1–2 wks. CT can confi rm diagnosis but is rarely needed. •Tropical illness: eg malaria: travel history, fl u-like illness (p416); typhus (p415). •In- tracranial hypotension: CSF leakage, eg iatrogenic after LP or epidural anaesthesia. Suspect if headaches worse on standing;. treat with epidural blood patch over leak, if conservative management with IV fl uids and caff eine fails. Character Tight band? Think tension headache (the usual cause of bilateral, non- pulsatile headache ± scalp muscle tenderness). Throbbing/pulsatile/lateralizing? Think migraine (p458). Frequency Headaches that recur tend to be benign: • Migraine: p458. • Cluster headache: (see BOX ‘Cluster headache’) • Trigeminal neuralgia: (see BOX ‘Trigemi- nal neuralgia’) • Recurrent (Moll aret’s) meningitis: suspect if fever/meningism with each headache. Send CSF for herpes simplex PCR (HSV2). Is there access to subarachnoid spaces via a skull fracture, or a recurring cause of aseptic meningitis (SLE, eg abducens nerve palsy, Behçet’s, sarcoid)? Duration Chronic, progressive headaches can indicate  ICP. Typically worse on waking, lying, bending forward, or coughing. Also: vomiting, papilloedema, sei- zures, false localizing signs, or odd behaviour. Do imaging to exclude a space- occupying lesion, and consider idiopathic intracranial hypertension. LP is contraindicated until after
