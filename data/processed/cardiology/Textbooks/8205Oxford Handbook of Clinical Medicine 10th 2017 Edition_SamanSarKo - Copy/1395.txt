Any potential benefi t must be weighed against the risk of symptomatic fl uid overload. Discuss this with patients and families, explain- ing the pros and cons of hydration and the uncertainty of the eff ect of hydration on survival:23 relatives may assume the patient is dying faster because of dehydration or that they will be suff ering with thirst. Make decisions about giving fl uids on a case- by-case basis. Review a patient’s hydration status at least daily. Plan for death. Ensure that a ‘Do not attempt resuscitation’ or ‘Allow natural death’, order has been made. Discuss this with the patient (where appropriate), their family, and/or others of importance to them. Document everything clearly. Do they want to die at home? This can usually be arranged at very short notice with help from district nursing teams and community palliative
