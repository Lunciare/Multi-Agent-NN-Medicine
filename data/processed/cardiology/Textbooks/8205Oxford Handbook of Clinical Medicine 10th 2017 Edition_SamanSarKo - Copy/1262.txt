Management Refer suspected or diagnosed dementia to integrated memory ser- vices for further assessment and management. Medication: (p489). Avoid drugs that impair cognition (eg neuroleptics, sedatives, tricyclics). Non-pharmacological inter- ventions: Non-cognitive symptoms (eg agitation) may respond to measures such as aromatherapy, multisensory stimulation, massage, music, and animal-assisted therapy. Other considerations • Depression: Common. Try an SSRI (eg citalopram 10–20mg OD) or, if severe, mirtazapine (15–45mg at night if eGFR >40). Cognitive behavioural therapy can help with social withdrawal and catastrophic thinking. • Capacity: Can the patient make decisions regarding medical or fi nancial aff airs? Wherever possible, allow them to. Suggest making an advanced directive or appointing a Lasting Power of Attorney in the early stages of the disease. 11 Dilated ventr icles without enlarged sulci.
