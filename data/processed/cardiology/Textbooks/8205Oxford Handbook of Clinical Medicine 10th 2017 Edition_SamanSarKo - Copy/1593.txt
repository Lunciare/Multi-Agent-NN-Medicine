thigh or above the inguinal ligament where it points down the leg, unlike an inguinal hernia which points to the groin. They oc- cur more often in  especially in middle age and the elderly. They are likely to be irreducible and to strangulate due to the rigidity of the canal’s borders. Anatomy:See fi g 13..32 Differential diagnosis: (See p651.) 1 Inguinal hernia. 2 Saphena varix. 3 An enlarged Cloquet’s node (p615). 4 Lipoma. 5 Femoral aneurysm. 6 Psoas abscess. Treatment: Surgical repair is recommended. Herniotomy is ligation and excision of the sac, herniorrhaphy is repair of the hernial defect. Paraumbilical hernias occur just above or below the umbilicus. Risk factors are obesity and ascites. Omentum or bowel herniates through the defect. Surgery in- volves repair of the rectus sheath (Mayo repair). Epigastric hernias pass through linea alba above the umbilicus. Incisional hernias follow breakdown of muscle closure after surgery (11–20%). If obese, repair is not easy. Mesh repair has recurrence but infection over sutures. Spigelian hernias occur through the linea semilunaris at the lateral edge of the rectus sheath, below and lateral to the umbilicus. Lumbar hernias occur through the inferior or superior lumbar triangles in the pos- terior
