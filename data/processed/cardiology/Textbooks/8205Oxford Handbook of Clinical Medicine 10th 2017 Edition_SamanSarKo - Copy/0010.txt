a interventions measure of success Allows cost-eff ectiveness Quality of life assessment comes from general public, analysis not those with disease Allows international comparison Potentially ageist—the elderly always have less ‘life expectancy’ to gain Focus on outcomes, not process ie care, compassion The inverse care law, equity, and distributive justice: The inverse care law states that the availability of good medical care varies inversely with the need for it. This arises due to poorer quality services, barriers to service ac- cess, and external disadvantage. By focusing on the benefi t gained from an interven- tion, the QALY system treats everyone as equal. But is this really equality? Distributive justice is the distribution of ‘goods’ so that those who are worst off become better off . In healthcare terms, this means allocation of resources to those in greatest need, regardless of QALYs. Compassion The importance of compassion4,5 in medicine is undisputed. It is an emotional re- sponse to negativity or suff ering that motivates a desire to help. It is more than ‘pity’, which has connotations of inferiority; and diff erent from ‘empathy’, which is a vicarious experience of the emotional state of another. It requires imaginative indwelling into another’s condition.
