(eg a large mass or a tension pneumothorax). There are three bulges normally visible on the left border of the mediastinum that help identify pathology if abnormal. From superior to inferior they are: 1 Aortic knuckle. 2 Pulmonary outfl ow tract. 3 Left ventricle. Hila The left hilum is higher than the right or at the same level (not lower); they should be the same size and density. The hila may be: Pulled up or down by fi brosis or collapse. Enlarged by: pulmonary arterial hypertension; bronchogenic ca; lymph nodes. Sarcoidosis, TB, and lymphoma can give bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Calcifi ed due to: sarcoid, past TB; silicosis; histoplasmosis (p408). Heart Normally less than half of the width of the thorax (cardiothoracic ratio <0.5). ⅓ should lie to the right of the vertebral column, ⅔ to the left. It may appear elongated if the chest is hyperinfl ated (COPD); or enlarged if the image is AP or if there is LV failure (fi g 16.3), or a pericardial eff usion. Are there calcifi ed valves? Diaphragm The right side is often slightly higher (due to the liver). Causes of raised hemidiaphragm: Trouble above the diaphragm—lung volume loss or infl ammation. Trouble
