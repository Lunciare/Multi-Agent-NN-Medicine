ery in between relapses. With time, remission becomes incomplete, so disability accumulates (secondary progression). 10% of patients display steadily progressive disability in the absence of relapses (primary progressive MS), while a minority of pa- tients experience no progressive disablement at all. Poor prognostic signs: Older ; motor signs at onset; many early relapses; many MRI lesions; axonal loss. Pregnancy: Does not alter the rate of progression: relapses may reduce during pregnancy and increase 3–6 months afterwards, but return to their previous rate thereafter. Management As with all neurological conditions, requires the coordinated care of a multidis ciplinary team and full involvement of the patient in all decisions.8 Lifestyle advice: Regular exercise, stopping smoking and avoiding stress may help. Disease-modifying drugs: Dimethyl fumarate is an option for mild/moderate re- lapsing-remitting MS. The monoclonal antibodies alemtuzumab (acts against T cells) and natalizumab (acts against VLA-4 receptors that allow immune cells to cross the blood–brain barrier) are also approved for relapsing-remitting disease. Interferon beta and glatiramer are not recommended by NICE on the balance of clinical and cost-eff ectiveness. Azathioprine is not recommended due to its SE profi le. Treating relapses: Methylprednisolone, eg 0.5–1g/24h IV/PO for 3–5d shortens acute relapses; use sparingly (
