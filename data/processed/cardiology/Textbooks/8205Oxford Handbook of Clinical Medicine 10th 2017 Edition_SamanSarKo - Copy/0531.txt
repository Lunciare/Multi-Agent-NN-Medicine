context of secondary prevention). Safe to use in diabetic retinopathy.11 • Nephropathy: (p314.) Microalbuminuria is when urine dipstick is Ωve for protein but the urine albumin:creatinine ratio (UA:CR) is 3mg/mmol (units vary, check lab) refl ecting early renal disease and vascular risk. If UA:CR >3, inhibiting the renin– angiotensin system with an ACE-i or sartan, even if BP is normal, protects the kidneys. Spironolactone may also help.12 Refer if UA:CR >7 ± GFR falling by >5mL/min/1.73m2/yr.13 • Diabetic retinopathy: Blindness is preventable. Annual retinal screening man- datory for all patients. Refer to an ophthalmologist if pre-proliferative changes or if any uncertainty at or near the macula (the only place capable of 6/6 vision). Pre-symptomatic screening enables laser photocoagulation to be used, aimed to stop production of angiogenic factors from the ischaemic retina. Indications: macu- lopathy or proliferative retinopathy. See fi gs 5.6–5.9. • Background retinopathy: Microaneurysms (dots), haemorrhages (blots), and hard exud ates (lipid deposits). Refer if near the macula, eg for intravitreal tri- amcinolone. • Pre-proliferative retinopathy: Cotton-wool spots (eg infarcts), haemorrhag- es, venous beading. These are signs of retinal ischaemia. Refer to a specialist. • Proliferative retinopathy: New vessels form. Needs urgent referral. • Maculopathy: (Hard to see
