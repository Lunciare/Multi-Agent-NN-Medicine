positives resulting in further invasive tests, false nega- tives conferring inappropriate reassurance when symptoms arise. When consider- ing screening an asymptomatic population the potential risks and benefi ts need to be weighed carefully and the Wilson criteria (see p23) should be satisfi ed. Should PSA be used to screen for prostate cancer? Most men with prostate cancer will have a high prostate-specifi c antigen (PSA). The higher the PSA, the more likely cancer is. However, PSA is non-specifi c and also raised in benign prostatic disease, BMI <25, recent ejaculation, recent rectal examination, prostatitis, and UTI. 76% of patients with a raised PSA do not have cancer. Following screening tests (see PROMIS study, 2017, for use of multi-parametric MRI), prostate biopsy is required for diagnosis. This has an inherent risk of complications includ- ing bleeding, infection, and urinary retention. ~1% will require hospital admission. The risks of PSA testing and subsequent biopsy need to be counterbalanced by benefi ts from screening.15 ~1 in 800 men avoid death from prostate cancer as a re- sult of PSA screening. But screening picks up many cancers that will never become fatal. This ‘overdiagnosis’ is thought to occur in ~40% of positive screens with
