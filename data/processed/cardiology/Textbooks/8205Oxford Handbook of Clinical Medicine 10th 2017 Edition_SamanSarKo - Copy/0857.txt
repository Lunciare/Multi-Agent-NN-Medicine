It is also necessary for interpretation of the FBC indices. Features Include: Acanthocytes: (fi g 8.10) Spicules on RBCS ( unstable RBC membrane lipid structure); causes: splenectomy, alcoholic liver disease, abetalipoproteinaemia, spherocytosis. Anisocytosis: Variation in RBC size, eg megaloblastic anaemia, thalassaemia, IDA. Basophilic RBC stippling: (fi g 8.11) Denatured RNA found in RBCS, indicating acceler- ated erythropoiesis or defective Hb synthesis. Seen in lead poisoning, megaloblastic anaemia, myelodysplasia, liver disease, haemoglobinopathy, eg thalassaemia. Blasts: Nucleated precursor cells. They should not normally appear in peripheral blood but do in myelofi brosis, leukaemia, and malignant marrow infi ltration. Burr cells (echinocytes): RBC projections (less marked than in acanthocytes); fi g 8.12. Cabot rings: Seen in: pernicious anaemia; lead poisoning; bad infections (fi g 8.13).1 Dimorphic picture: Two populations of red cells. Seen after treatment of Fe, B12, or folate defi ciency, in mixed defi ciency (Fe
