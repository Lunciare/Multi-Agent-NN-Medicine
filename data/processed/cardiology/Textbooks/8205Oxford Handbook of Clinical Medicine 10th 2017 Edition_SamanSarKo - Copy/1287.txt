onset is 30yrs. : ≥3:1. Presentation Usually monosymptomatic: ~20% present with unilateral optic neuri- tis (pain on eye movement and rapid central vision). Corticospinal tract and bladder involvement are also common, and symptoms may worsen with heat (eg hot bath or exercise). Other symptoms/signs see table 10.8. Diagnosis This is clinical, made by a consultant neurologist using established crite- ria (eg McDonald, see table 10.9) and after alternative diagnoses have been excluded. Early diagnosis and treatment reduce relapse rates and disability so refer to neu- rology as soon as MS is suspected. Tests Depending on presenting symptoms, some patients may need extra support- ing information to make a diagnosis (as per the McDonald criteria). MRI: Sensi- tive but not sp e cifi c for plaque detection. It may also exclude other causes, eg cord compression. CSF: Oligoclonal bands of IgG on electrophoresis that are not present in serum suggest CNS infl am mation. Delayed visual, auditory, and somatosensory evoked potentials. Progression Most patients follow a relapsing-remitting course, with initial recov- ery in between relapses. With time, remission becomes incomplete, so disability accumulates (secondary progression). 10% of patients display steadily progressive disability in the absence of relapses (primary progressive MS), while
