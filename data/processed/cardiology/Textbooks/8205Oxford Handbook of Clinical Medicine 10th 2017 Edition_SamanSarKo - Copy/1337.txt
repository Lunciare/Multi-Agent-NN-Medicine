cot’s joints in the shoulder/wrist due to lost joint prop rio ception (see fi g 5.11, p213). Syringo bulbia (Brains tem involve- ment.) Nyst agmus, tongue atro- phy, dysphagia, pharyngeal/palatal weak ness, Vth nerve sensory loss. MRI imaging How big is the syrinx? Any base-of-brain (Chiari) malfor- mation? Surgery Don’t wait for gross dete- rioration to occur. Decompression at the foramen magnum may be tried in Chiari malformati ons to promote free fl ow of CSF, and so prevent syrinx dilatation. Surgery may reduce pain and progression.

Can have multiple neurological manifestations: these conditions are part of the diff erential diagnosis of meningitis, intrac ranial mass lesions, demen- tia, encephalomyelitis, cord problems, and peripheral neuropathies. Acute infection: May be associated with transient aseptic meningoencephalitis (typically self-limiting), myelo pathy, and neuropathy. Opportunistic infections: Arise during low CD4 counts, which allow unusual or atyp- ical organisms to infect the nervous system: • Toxoplasma gondii (p400) is the main CNS pathogen in AIDS, causing cerebral abscesses which present with focal signs, eg seizures, hemiparesis. CT/MRI shows ring-shaped contrast-enhancing lesions. Treat with pyrimethamine (+folinic acid) +
