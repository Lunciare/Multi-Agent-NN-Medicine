In- stead, it relies on properties of longitudinal sound waves. This has made it a popular and safe form of imaging with increasingly widespread applications. High-frequency sound waves (3–15MHz) are generated in the transducer (transmitter and receiver) by the vibrations of a piezo-electric quartz crystal as a voltage is applied. Passage of sound waves through tissue is aff ected by attenuation and refl ection. Attenuation disperses waves out of the receiver’s range, but it is the waves refl ected back to the transducer that determine the image. Its quality depends on the diff erence in acoustic impedance between adjacent soft tissues. Processing With the help of software a real-time 2D image is made. During process- ing, an average attenuation value is assumed throughout the tissue examined, so if a higher-than-average attenuation structure is in the superfi cial tissues (eg fi brous tissue, calcifi cation, or gas), then everything deep to it will be in a low intensity (black) acoustic shadow. If a lower-than-average attenuation object (eg fl uid-fi lled/ cystic structure)
