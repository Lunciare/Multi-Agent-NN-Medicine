than non-selective NSAIDs. Cardiovascular side effects: NSAIDS—all are associated with a small increased risk of MI and stroke (independent of cardiovascular risk factor or duration of use).14 Risks are higher in those with concomitant IHD risk factors, eg diabetes and hypertension. Coxibs and diclofenac are higher risk, and are contraindicated if prior history of MI, PVD, stroke, or heart failure. Naproxen has the lowest cardiovas- cular risk. Low-dose celecoxib may be considered for patients on low-dose aspirin (if NSAID is required) as it does not interact with it.15 Renal risks: Higher for patients already on diuretics, ACE, or ARB. Risks are also increased in the elderly, those with hypertension and T2DM. Overall, naproxen (<1000mg/day) or ibuprofen (<1200mg/day) plus PPI may be the safest options. Alternatives to NSAIDs: Paracetamol, topical NSAIDs, opioids. Strengthening exer- cises may be more benefi cial than mild oral analgesics. Counselling patients: Make sure patients understand about the drugs they are taking: bleeding is more common in those who know less about their drugs.16 • Only to take NSAIDs when they need them. • Stop NSAIDs and seek urgent medical review if they develop abdominal pain or any symptoms of GI bleeding (eg report black stools ±
