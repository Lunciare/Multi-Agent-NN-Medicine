Ostium primum defects: associated with AV valve anomalies, eg in Down’s syn- drome; present in childhood. Signs and symptoms: Chest pain, palpitations, dyspnoea. Arrhythmias incl. AF; JVP; wide, fi xed split S2; pulmonary systolic fl ow murmur. Pulmonary hypertension may cause pulmonary or tricuspid regurgitation, dyspnoea and haemoptysis. Frequency of migraine. Simple tests: ECG: RBBB with LAD (primum defect) or RAD (secundum defect). CXR: small aortic knuckle, pulmonary plethora, atrial enlargement. Com- plications: • Reversal of left-to-right shunt, ie Eisen men ger’s complex: initial LR shunt leads to pulmonary hypertension which increases right heart pressures until they exceed left heart pressures, hence shunt reversal. This causes cyanosis as de- oxygenated blood enters systemic circulation. • Paradoxical emboli eg causing CVAs (veinartery via ASD; rare). Treatment: May close spontaenously. If not, primum de- fects are usually closed in childhood. Secundum defects should be closed if sympto- matic or signs of RV overload. Transcatheter closure is more common than surgical. Ventricular septal defect (VSD) A hole connects the ventricles. Causes: Congenital (prevalence 2:1000 births); acquired (post-MI). Symptoms: May present with severe heart failure in infancy, or remain asymptomatic and be detected incidentally in later life. Signs: Classically, a harsh pan systolic murmur
