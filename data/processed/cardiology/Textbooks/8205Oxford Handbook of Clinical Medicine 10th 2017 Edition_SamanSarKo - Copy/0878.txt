Prosthetic heart valves can also cause mechanical damage. 4 Infection: Malaria (p416): RBC lysis and ‘blackwater fever’ (haemoglobinuria). All infections can exacerbate haemolysis. 5 Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: Rare acquired stem cell disorder, with haemolysis (esp. at nighthaem oglobinuria, fi g 15.8, p705), marrow failure + thrombophilia. Tests: urinary haemosiderin +ve; if suspect in Coombs -ve intravascular haemolysis, seek confi rmation by fl ow cytometry. : anti coagulation; monoclonal anticomplement antibodies (eg eculizumab); stem cell transplantation. Hereditary 1 Enzyme defects: • Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) defi ciency (X-linked): the chief RBC enzyme defect, aff ects 100 million (mainly ) in Mediterranean, Africa, Middle/Far East. Most are asymptomatic, but may get oxidative crises due to gluta thione production, precipitated by drugs (eg primaquine, sulfonamides, aspirin), exposure to Vicia faba (broad beans/favism), or illness. In attacks, there is rapid anaemia and jaundice. Film: bite- and blister-cells (fi gs 8.32, 8.33). Tests: Enzyme assay (>8wks after crisis as young RBCs may have enough enzyme so results normal). : Avoid precipitants (eg, henna, fi g 8.34); transfuse if severe. • Pyruvate kinase defi ciency (AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE): ATP production causes RBC survival. Homozygotes have neonatal jaundice; later, haemolysis with splenomeg- aly ± jaundice. Tests: enzyme assay. :
