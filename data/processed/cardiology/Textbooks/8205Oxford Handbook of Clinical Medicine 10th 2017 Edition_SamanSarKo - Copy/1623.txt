of calorie intake by reducing stomach capacity. 2 Malabsorption of nutrients by reduc- ing the length of functional small bowel. NB: This also aff ects the levels of circulating gut peptides (eg PYY and GLP-1), which are thought to play a role in the mechanism of satiety and weight loss. Choose surgical intervention jointly with patient: • Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB): This restrictive technique creates a pre-stomach pouch by placing a silicone band around the top of the stomach, which serves as a new smaller stomach. The band can be adjusted by addition or removal of saline through a subcutaneous port (see fi g 13.40). LAGB is associated with improve- ments in comorbidities and quality of life. Weight loss is slower and less than with gastric bypass but there is lower mortality and fewer complications. Relatively non- invasive and band removal possible. Complications: pouch enlargement, band slip, band erosion, and port infection/breakage. • Sleeve gastrectomy: (fi g 13.41) Involves division of the stomach vertically, reduc- ing it in size by about 75%. The pyloric valve at the bottom of the stomach is left intact so function and digestion are unaltered. The procedure is not reversible and may be a
