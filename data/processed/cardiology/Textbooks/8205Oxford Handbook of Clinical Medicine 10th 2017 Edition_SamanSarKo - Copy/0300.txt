During the procedure, ECG and arterial pressures are monitored continuously. In the UK, the majority are performed as day-case procedures. Indications • Coronary artery disease: diagnostic (assessment of coronary vessels and graft pa- tency); therapeutic (angioplasty, stent insertion), fi g 3.18b. • Valvular disease: diagnostic (pressures indicate severity); therapeutic valvuloplas- ty (if the patient is too ill or declines valve surgery). • Congenital heart disease: diagnostic (assessment of severity of lesions by meas- uring pressures and saturations); therapeutic (balloon dilatation or septostomy).
