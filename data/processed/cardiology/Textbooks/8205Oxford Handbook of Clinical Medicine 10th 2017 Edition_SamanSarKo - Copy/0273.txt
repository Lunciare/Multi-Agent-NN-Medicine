of these features, is the best way to stratify pa- tients likely to have cardiac pain. If the history is non-specifi c, there are no risk fac- tors for cardiovascular diseases, and ECG and plasma troponin T (p118) are normal 6–12h after the onset of pain, discharge will probably be OK. 4 When in doubt, get help. Features making cardiac pain unlikely: • Stabbing, shooting pain. • Pain lasting <30s, however intense. • Well-localized, left sub-mammary pain (‘In my heart, doctor’). • Pains of continually varying location. • Youth. Do not feel that you must diagnose every pain. Chest pain with no cause is com- mon, even after extensive tests. Some patients have a ‘chronic pain syndrome’ similar to post-herpetic neuralgia. Typically, this responds to a tricyclic, eg low- dose amitriptyline at night (this dose does not imply any depression). Avoid being that doctor who triumphantly tells a patient that they are fi ne and can go home, only to be met by a glare, as the disabling pain the patient presented with is no better than when they arrived. Take time to explain why you do not believe the pain is a result of dangerous pathology; to give advice
