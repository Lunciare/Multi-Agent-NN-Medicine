Usually +ve for blood (90%). MSU: MC&S. Further tests for cause: Urine pH; 24h urine for: calcium, ox- alate, urate, citrate, sodium, creatinine; stone biochemistry (sieve urine & send stone). Imaging: Non-contrast CT is investigation of choice for imaging stones (99% visible) & helps exclude diff erential causes of an acute abdomen. A ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm may present similarly. 80% of stones are visible on KUB XR (kidneys + ureters + bladder). Look along ureters for calcifi cation over the transverse processes of the vertebral bodies. US an alternative for hydronephrosis or hydroureter.  Initially: Analgesia, eg diclofenac 75mg IV/IM, or 100mg PR. (If CI: opioids) + IV fl uids if unable to tolerate PO; antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h IV, or gen- tamicin) if infection. Stones <5mm in lower ureter: ~90–95% pass spontaneously. Fluid intake. Stones >5mm/pain not resolving: Medical expulsive therapy: start at presentation; nifedipine 10mg/8h PO or -blockers (tams ulosin 0.4mg/d) promote expulsion and reduce analgesia requirements. Most pass within 48h (>80% after ~30d). If not, try extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) (if <1cm), or ureteros- copy using a basket. ESWL: US waves shatter stone. SE: renal injury, may also cause BP and DM. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL): keyhole
