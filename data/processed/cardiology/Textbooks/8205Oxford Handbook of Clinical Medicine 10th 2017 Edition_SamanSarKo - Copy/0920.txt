Ionizing radiation (eg X-rays) during preg- nancy, and Down’s syndrome are important associations. It is the commonest cancer of childhood, and is rare in adults. CNS involvement is common. Classifi cation Based on three systems: 1 Morphological:T he FAB system (French, American, British) divides ALL into three types (L1, L2, L3) by microscopic appearance. Provides limited information (fi gs 8.45–8.48). 2 Immunological: Surface markers are used to classify ALL into: • Precursor B-cell ALL • T-cell ALL • B-cell ALL. 3 Cytogenetic: Chromosomal analysis. Abnormalities are detected in up to 85%, which are often translocations.6 Useful for predicting prognosis, eg poor with Philadelphia chromosome (p358), and for detecting disease recurrence. Signs and symptoms (fi g 8.49) Due to: • Marrow failure: anaemia (Hb), infection (WCC), and bleeding (platelets). • Infi ltration: hepato- and splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy—superfi cial or medi- astinal, orchidomegaly, CNS involvement—eg
