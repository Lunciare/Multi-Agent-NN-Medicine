caused lysis of staphylococci. Mass production and the ‘golden age’ of antibiotics fol- lowed, with the introduction of a variety of drugs selectively toxic to bacterial, but not mammalian cells. This is achieved by: • utilizing a target unique to bacteria, eg cell wall • selectively targeting bacterial-specifi c components, eg enzymes, ribosomes • preventing transport of the drug into human cells, eg metronidazole can only be transported into anaerobic bacteria. The mechanism of action of diff erent classes of antibiotic is shown in fi g 9.4.

This spectrum of available antibiotics revolutionized clinical practice and led to the declaration: ‘It is time to close the book on infectious diseases, and declare the war against pestilence won’ (attributed in urban legend to Dr. William H Stewart, US Surgeon General, 1965–1969). Such confi dence failed to consider that the capacity for a prokaryotic micro-organism
