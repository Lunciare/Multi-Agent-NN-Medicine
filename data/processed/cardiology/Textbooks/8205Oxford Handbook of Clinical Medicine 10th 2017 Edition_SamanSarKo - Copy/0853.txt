Check coeliac serology in all (p266): if negative then refer all males and females who are not menstruating for urgent gastroscopy and colonoscopy. Consider stool microscopy for ova if relevant travel history. Faecal occult blood is not recommended as sensitivity is poor. IDA with no obvious source of bleeding mandates careful GI workup.2 Treatment Treat the cause. Oral iron, eg ferrous sulfate 200mg/8h PO. SE: nausea, ab- dominal discomfort, diarrhoea or constipation, black stools. Hb should rise by 10g/L/ week, with a modest reticulocytosis (young RBC, p328). Continue for at least 3 months after Hb normalizes to replenish stores. IV iron is only indicated if the oral route is impossible or ineff ective, eg functional iron defi ciency in chronic renal failure, where there is inadequate mobilization of iron stores in response to erythropoietin therapy. The usual reason that IDA fails to respond to iron replacement is that the patient has rejected the pills—check compliance. Is the reason for the problem GI distur- bance? Altering the
