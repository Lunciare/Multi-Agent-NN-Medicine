Inferior petrosal sinus: Vth and VIth cranial nerve palsies, with temporal and retro-orbital pain (Gradenigo’s syndrome,. suggesting otitis media is the cause). • Cavernous sinus: Often due to spread from facial pustules or foll iculitis, causing headache, chemosis, oedematous eyelids, proptosis, painful ophthalmoplegia, fever. Cortical vein thrombosis (CVT) Usually occurs with a sinus thrombus as it extends into the cortical veins, causing infarction in a venous territory (fi g 10.21). These infarcts give rise to stroke-like focal symptoms that develop over days. There are often seizures, and an associated headache which may come on suddenly (thunderclap headache). Causes Numerous, including anything that promotes a hypercoagulable state (p374). Common causes: Pregnancy/puerperium, combined OCP, head injury, dehydration, blood dyscrasias, tumours (local invasion/pressure), extracranial malignancy (hyperco- agulability), recent LP. Other causes: Infection (meningitis, abscesses, otitis media, cer- ebral malaria, TB), Drugs (eg antifi brinolytics, androgens), SLE, vasculitis, Crohn’s or UC. Diff erential diagnosis Subarachnoid haemorrhage, meningitis, encephalitis, in- tracranial abscess, arterial infarction. Investigations Exclude subarachnoid haemorrhage (if thunderclap headache, p478) and meningitis (p822). Bloods: Thrombophilia screen. Imaging: CT/MRI venog- raphy may show the absence of a sinus (fi g 10.19), though an absent transverse sinus can be a normal variant. MRI T2-weighted gradient
