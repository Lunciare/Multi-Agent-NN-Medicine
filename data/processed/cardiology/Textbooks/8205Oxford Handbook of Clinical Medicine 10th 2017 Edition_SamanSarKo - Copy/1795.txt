mutation on chr. 17), has AD inheritance. Quality of life is good; total incapacity rare. Hand pain/paraesthesiae may respond to nerve release. Jean-Marie Charcot, 1825–1893; Pierre Marie, 1853–1940 (French neurologists); Howard H Tooth, 1856–1926 (British physician) Churg–Strauss syndrome (Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis.) A triad of adult-onset asthma, eosinophilia, and vasculitis (± vasospasm ± MI ± DVT), aff ecting lungs, nerves, heart, and skin. A septic-shock picture/systemic infl amma- tory response syndrome may occur (with glomerulon eph ritis/renal failure, esp. if ANCA +ve). : Steroids; biological agents if refractory disease, eg rituximab.14 Jacob Churg, 1910–2005; Lotte Strauss, 1913–1985 (US pathologists) Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) The cause is a prion (PrPSc), a misfolded form of a normal protein (PrPc), that can transform other proteins into prion proteins (hence its infectivity). PrPSc leads to spongiform changes (tiny cavities ± tubulovesicular struc- tures) in the brain.15 Most cases are sporadic (incidence: 1–3/million/yr). Variant CJD (vCJD; ≈225 cases worldwide)16 is transmitted via con tamin ated CNS tissue aff ected by bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) (see BOX ‘Signs that may distinguish variant CJD’). Inherited forms: (eg Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome, P102L mutation in PRNP gene with ataxia ± self-mutilation), the ‘normal’ protein is too unstable, readily trans forming to
