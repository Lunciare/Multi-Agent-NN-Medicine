Consult BNF if on dipyridamole or has had a heart transplant. Give 6mg IV bolus into a large vein, followed by 0.9% saline fl ush, while recording a rhythm strip. If unsuccessful, after 2min give 12mg, then one further 12mg bolus. Warn about SE: transient chest tightness, dyspnoea, headache, fl ushing. Relative CI: Asthma, 2nd/3rd-degree AV block or sinoatrial disease (unless pacemaker). Interactions: Po- tentiated by dipyridamole; antagonized by theophylline. Specifi cs Sinus tachycardia: Identify and treat underlying cause. Supraventricular tachycardia: If adenosine fails, use verapamil 2.5–5mg IV over 2min. NB: NOT if on a -blocker. If no response, a further 5mg IV over 3min (if age <60yrs). Alternatives: atenolol 2.5mg IV repeated at 5min intervals until 10mg given; or amiodarone. If unsuccessful, use DC cardioversion. Atrial fi brillation/fl utter: Manage with rate control; seek help if resistant (p130). Atrial tachycardia: Rare; may be due to digoxin toxicity: withdraw digoxin, consider digoxin-specifi c antibody fragments. Maintain K+ at 4–5mmol/L. Multifocal atrial tachycardia: Most commonly occurs in COPD. Correct hypoxia and hypercapnia. Consider verapamil if rate remains >110bpm. Junctional tachycardia: Where anterograde conduction through the AV node oc- curs, vagal manoeuvres are worth trying. Adenosine will usually cardiovert a junc- tional
