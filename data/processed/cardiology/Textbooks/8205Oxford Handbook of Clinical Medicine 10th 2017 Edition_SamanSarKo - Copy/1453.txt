Arteritis of the vasa nervorum (arterial supply to peripheral nerves) may cause mononeuritis multiplex or a sensorimotor polyneuropathy.53 GU: Orchitis—testicular pain or tenderness. Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) PMR is not a true vasculitis and its pathogenesis is unknown. PMR and GCA share the same demographic characteristics and, although separate conditions, the two frequently occur together. Features: Age >50yrs; subacute onset (<2 weeks) of bilateral aching, tenderness, and morning stiff ness in shoulders, hips, and proximal limb muscles ± fatigue, fe- ver, weight, anorexia, and depression. There may be associated mild poly arthritis, tenosynovitis, and carpal tunnel syndrome (10%). Weakness is not a feature. Investigations: CRP, ESR typically >40 (but may be normal); AlkP is  in 30%. Note creatinine kinase levels are normal (helping to distinguish from myositis/myopathies). Differential diagnoses: Recent-onset RA, polymyositis, hypothyroidism, primary muscle disease, occult malignancy or infection, osteoarthritis (especially cervical spondylosis, shoulder OA), neck lesions, bilateral subacromial impingement (OHCS p666), spinal stenosis (OHCS p676). Management: Prednisolone 15mg/d PO. Expect a dramatic response within 1 week and consider an alternative diagnosis if not.  dose slowly, eg by 1mg/month (according to symptoms/ESR).
