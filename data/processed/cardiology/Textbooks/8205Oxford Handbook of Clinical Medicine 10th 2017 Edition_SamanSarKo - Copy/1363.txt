It uses ionizing radiation to cause damage to DNA. This prevents cell division and leads to cell death. The aim of radiotherapy treatment is to inactivate cancer cells without causing a severe reaction in normal tissue. Radical treatment Given with curative intent. Total dose ranges from 40–70 gray (Gy) in up to 40 fractions. Some regimens involve several smaller fractions a day with a gap of 6–8h. Combined chemoradiation is used in some sites, eg anus and oesophagus, to increase response rate. Palliative radiotherapy Aims to relieve symptoms, may not impact on survival. Doses are smaller and given in fewer fractions to off er short-term tumour control with minimal side-eff ects. Palliation is used for brain metastases, spinal cord com- pression, visceral compression, and bleeding, eg haemoptysis, haematuria. Bone pain from metastases can be reduced or eliminated in 60% of cases. Early reactions Occur ~2 weeks into treatment, peak ~2–4 weeks after treatment.
