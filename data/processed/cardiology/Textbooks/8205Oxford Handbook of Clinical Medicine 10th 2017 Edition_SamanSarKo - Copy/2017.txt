Altered level of con- sciousness implies either: 1 A diff use, bilateral, cortical dysfunction (usually producing loss of awareness with normal arousal), or 2 Damage to the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) located through- out the brainstem from the medulla to the thalami (usually producing loss of arousal with unassessable awareness). The brainstem can be aff ected directly (eg pontine haemorrhage) or indirectly (eg compression from transtentorial or cerebellar herniation secondary to a mass or oedema). Systematic examination: • Level of consciousness; describe using objective words/AVPU. • Respiratory pattern (p53)—Cheyne-Stokes (brainstem lesions or compression) hyperventilation (acidosis, hypoxia, or, rarely, neurogenic), ataxic or apneustic (breath-holding) breathing (brainstem damage with grave prognosis). • Eyes—almost all patients with ARAS pathology will have eye fi ndings: 1 Visual fi elds—in light coma, test fi elds with visual threat. No blink in one fi eld suggests hemianopia and contralateral hemisphere lesion. 2 Pupils—normal direct and consensual refl exes present = intact midbrain. Midposition (3–5mm) non-reactive ± irregular = midbrain
