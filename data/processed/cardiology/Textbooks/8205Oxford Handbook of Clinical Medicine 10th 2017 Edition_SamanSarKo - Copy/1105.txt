months), or chronic (>6 months). Non-specifi c: fever, anorexia, sweats, weight loss, malaise ( TB). Localized infection: septic arthritis, spondylitis, meningitis, endo- carditis, orchitis, abscess. Diagnosis: Culture with prolonged incubation due to slow doubling time.17 Serology (four assays performed by Public Health England Brucella Reference Unit 0151 529 4900). Treatment: Doxycycline, rifampicin, aminoglycoside, ceftriaxone, co-trimoxazole. Needs prolonged course as intracellular with slow dou- bling time. Relapse usually due to inadequate dose/duration/adherence. Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) Q fever is derived from the label ‘query’ fever attributed to an unexplained disease in Australian abattoir workers. C. burnetii is now recognized as the pathogenic agent. Sheep, goats, cattle are main sources of infection (also cats, dogs, rabbits, ducks, ticks). Occurs worldwide. Spores can survive in soil, animal products, and water for months–yr. Transmitted by contact, inhalation of dust, or consumption of raw milk products. Presentation: Incubation 3–30d. ~50% asymptomatic. Non-specifi c symptoms: fever (1–3wks), nausea, fatigue, headache. Pneumonia in 1–2%: typical or atypical, may have rapid progression. Also splenomegaly, granulomatous hepatitis, aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, osteomyelitis. Endocarditis is the most common form of chronic disease. Diagnosis: Coxiella cannot be cultured using routine lab methods.17 PCR is rapid. Serology can take 2–6wks to become positive
