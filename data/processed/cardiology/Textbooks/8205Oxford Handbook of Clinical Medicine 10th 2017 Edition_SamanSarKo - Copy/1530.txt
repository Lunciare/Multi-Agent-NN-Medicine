vena caval obstruction (p528). • Metabolic imbalance: Electrolyte abnormalities—see BOX ‘Refeeding syndrome’; deranged plasma glucose; hyperlipidaemia; defi ciency syndromes (table 6.9, p268); acid-base disturbance (eg hypercapnia from excessive CO2 production). • Mechanical: Pneumothorax; embolism of IV line tip. Guidelines for success Liaise closely with line insertion team, nutrition team, and pharmacist. • Meticulous sterility. Do not use central venous lines for uses other than nutrition. Remove the line if you suspect infection. Culture its tip. • Review fl uid balance at least twice daily, and requirements for energy and elec- trolytes daily. • Check weight, fl uid balance, and urine glucose daily during establishment of par- enteral nutrition. Check plasma glucose, creatinine and electrolytes (including cal- cium and phosphate), and FBC daily until stable. Check LFT and lipid clearance three times a week until stable. Check zinc and magnesium weekly. • Do not rush. Achieve the maintenance regimen in small steps. • Treat underlying conditions vigorously—eg sepsis may impede +ve nitrogen balance. 5 Enteral feeding promotes integrity of the gut mucosal barrier, thus preventing bacterial and endotoxin translocation across the gut wall, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction and perpetuation of a sys- temic infl ammatory response—even when the
