play a part (eg EBV p405).43 Prevalence ~0.2%. :≈9:1, typically women of child-bearing age. Commoner in African-Caribbeans, Asians, and if HLA B8, DR2, or DR3 +ve. ~10% of patients have a 1st- or 2nd-degree relative with SLE. Clinical features See BOX. Remitting and relapsing illness of variable presentation and course. Features often non-specifi c (malaise, fatigue, myalgia, and fever) or or- gan-specifi c and caused by active infl ammation or damage. Other features include lymphadenopathy, weight loss,alopecia, nail-fold infarcts, non-infective endocarditis (Libman–Sacks syndrome), Raynaud’s (30%; see p708), stroke, and retinal exudates. Immunology >95% are ANA +ve. A high anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody titre is highly specifi c, but only +ve in ~60% of cases. ENA (p553) may be +ve in 20–30% (anti-Ro, anti-La, anti-Sm, anti-RNP); 40% are RhF +ve; antiphospholipid antibodies (an- ticardiolipin or lupus anticoagulant) may also be +ve. SLE may be associated with other autoimmune conditions: Sjögren’s (15–20%), autoimmune thyroid disease (5–10%). Diagnosis See BOX. Monitoring activity Three best tests: 1 Anti-dsDNA antibody ti- tres. 2 Complement: C3, C4 (denotes consumption of complement, hence C3 and C4, and C3d and C4d, their degradation products). 3 ESR. Also: BP, urine for casts or pro- tein (lupus nephritis, below), FBC,
