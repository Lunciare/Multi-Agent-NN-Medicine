SGLTI: Selective sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor. Blocks the reabsorp- tion of glucose in the kidneys and promotes excretion of excess glucose in the urine (eg empaglifl ozin, shown to reduce mortality from cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 DM, when compared to placebo).8 __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 220088 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE Using insulin 209 Vital to educate to self-adjust doses in the light of exercise, fi ngerprick glucose, calorie intake, and carbohydrate counting. •Phone support (trained nurse 7/24). •Can modify diet wisely and avoid binge drinking (danger of delayed hypoglycae- mia). •Partner can abort hypoglycaemia: sugary drinks; GlucoGel® PO if coma (no risk of aspiration). •Dose titration to target—eg by 2–4 UNIT steps. It is vital to write UNITS in full when prescribing insulin to avoid misinterpre- tation of U for zero! Subcutaneous insulins Short-, medium-, or long-acting. Strength: 100U/mL. 1 Ultra-fast acting (Humalog®; Novorapid®); inject at start of meal, or just after (unless sugar-laden)—helps match what is actually eaten (vs what is planned). 2 Isophane insulin (variable peak at4 –12h): favoured by NICE (it’s
