skin grafts as the burn is a major source of infl ammatory cytokines and forms a rich medium for bacterial growth. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 884466 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE Smoke inhalation 847 Consider if: • History of exposure to fi re and smoke • Burns to face in an enclosed space • Singed nasal hairs • Hoarseness or change in voice • Soot in saliva or sputum • Harsh cough • Infl amed oropharynx • Stridor. Initially laryngospasm leads to hypoxia and straining (leading to petechiae), then hypoxic cord relaxation leads to true inhalation injury. Free radicals, cyanide com- pounds, and carbon monoxide (CO) accompany thermal injury. Cyanide (p842) compounds (generated, eg from burning plastics) stop oxidative phosphorylation, causing dizziness, headaches, and seizures. Tachycardia + dyspnoea soon give way to bradyc ardia + apnoea. CO is generated later in the fi re as oxygen is depleted. NB: COHb levels do not correlate well with the severity of poisoning and partly refl ect smoking status and urban life. Use nomograms to extrapolate peak levels. 100% O2 is given to elute both cyanide and CO. Involve ICU/anaesthetists early if any signs of airway obstruction or respiratory failure: early intubation and ventilation may be useful. Enlist
