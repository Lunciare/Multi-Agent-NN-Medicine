Alcohol, ethylene glycol, methanol, paracetamol, or carbon monoxide poisoning (p842). • Osmolality: Alcohols (ethyl or methyl); ethylene glycol. See p668. Management See fi g 19.25. • Take blood as appropriate (p840). Always check paracetamol and salicylate levels. • Empty stomach if appropriate (p840). • Consider specifi c antidote (p842) or oral activated charcoal (p840). • If you are not familiar with the poison get more information. Toxbase (www. toxbase.org) should be your fi rst thought. If no information here or in doubt how best to act, phone the Poisons Information Service: in the UK phone 0844 892 0111. Continuing care Measure temperature, pulse, BP, and blood glucose regularly. Keep on cardiac monitor. If unconscious, nurse semi-prone, turn regularly. Catherize if the bladder is distended, or acute kidney injury (p298) is suspected, or forced diuresis undertaken. Consider ICU, eg if respiration. Psychiatric assessment Be sympathetic despite the hour! Interview relatives and friends if possible. Aim to establish: • Intentions at time. Was this a suicide attempt, if so was the act planned? What precautions against being found? Did the patient seek help afterwards? Does the patient think the method was dangerous? Was there a fi nal act (eg suicide note)? •
