acromegaly; myeloma; local tumours (lipomas, ganglia); rheumatoid arthritis; amyloidosis; pregnancy; sarcoidosis. Tests: Neurophysiology helps by confi rming the lesion’s site and severity (and like- lihood of improvement after surgery). Maximal wrist fl exion for 1 min (Phalen’s test) may elicit symptoms, and tapping over the nerve at the wrist can induce tingling (Tinel’s test) but both are rather non-specifi c. Treatment: Splinting, local steroid injection ± decompr ession surgery. NB: There is also tarsal tunnel syndrome: unilateral burning sole pain following tibial nerve compression. Managing ulnar mononeuropathies from entrapments The ulnar nerve asks for trouble in at least fi ve places at the elbow, starting proximally at the arcade of Struthers (a musculofascial band ~8cm proximal to the medial epicondyle), and ending distally where it exits the fl exor carpi ulnaris muscle in the forearm. Most often, compression occurs at the epicondylar groove or at the point where the nerve passes between the two heads of fl exor carpi ul- naris (true cubital tunnel syndrome). Trauma can easily damage the nerve against its bony confi nes (the medial condyle of the humerus—the ‘funny bone’). Normally, stretch and compression forces on the ulnar nerve at the elbow are moderated by its
