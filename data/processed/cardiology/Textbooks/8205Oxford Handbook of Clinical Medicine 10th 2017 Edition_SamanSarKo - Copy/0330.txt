but randomized trials are few. The patient’s own saphenous vein or internal mammary artery is used as the graft. Several grafts may be placed. >50% of vein grafts close in 10yrs (low-dose aspirin helps prevent this). Internal mammary artery grafts last longer (but may cause chest- wall numbness). On-pump or off-pump: Seems to make little diff erence. 22 After CABG: If angina persists or recurs (from poor graft run-off , distal disease, new atheroma, or graft occlusion) restart antianginal drugs, and consider an- gioplasty. Ensure optimal management of hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipi- daemia, and that smoking is addressed. Continue aspirin 75mg OD indefi nitely; consider clopidogrel if aspirin contraindicated. Mood, sex, and intellectual prob- lems 23 are common early. Rehabilitation helps: • Exercise: walkcycleswimjog. • Drive at 1 month: no need to tell DVLA if non-HGV licences, p158. • Return to work, eg at 3 months. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 112233 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 124 Arrhythmias—overview Disturbances of cardiac rhythm (arrhythmias) are: • common • often benign (but may refl ect underlying heart disease) • often intermittent, causing diagnostic diffi culty see BOX ‘Continuous ECG monitoring’ • occasionally severe, causing cardiac compromise which may be fatal. Emergency management: pp804–9.
