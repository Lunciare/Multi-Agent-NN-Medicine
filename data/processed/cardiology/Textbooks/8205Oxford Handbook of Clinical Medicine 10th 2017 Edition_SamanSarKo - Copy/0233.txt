The maximum fl ow rate of urine is normally ~18–30mL/s. Terminal dribbling Dribbling at the end of urination, often seen in conjunction with incontinence follow- ing incomplete urination, associated with prostatism. Urinary changes Cloudy urine suggests pus (UTI) but is often normal phosphate precipitation in an alkaline urine. Pneumaturia (bubbles in urine as it is passed). Occurs with UTI due to gas-forming organisms or may signal an enterovesical (bowel–bladder) fi stula from diverticulitis, Crohn’s disease or neoplastic disease of the bowel.
