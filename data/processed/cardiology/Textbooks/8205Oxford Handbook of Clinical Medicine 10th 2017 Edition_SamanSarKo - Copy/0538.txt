nerves). Treatment: hard! If sudden or seve re, immunosuppression may help (corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, ciclosporin). Amyotrophy: Painful wasting of quadriceps and other pelvifemoral muscles. Use electrophysiology to show, eg lum- bosacral radiculopathy, plexopathy, or proximal crural neuropathy. Natural course: variable with gradual but often incomplete improvement. IV immunoglobulins have been used. Autonomic neuropathy: (p505) Postural BP drop; cerebro vascular au- toregulation; loss of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (vagal neuropathy); gastroparesis; urine retention; erectile dysfunction; gustatory sweating; diarrhoea (may respond to codeine phosphate). Gastroparesis (early satiety, post-prandial bloating, nausea/ vomiting) is diagnosed by gastric scintigraphy with a 99tech netium-labelled meal; anti-emetics, erythromycin, or gastric pacing. Postural hypotensi on may respond to fl udrocortisone (SE: oedema, BP)/midodrine (-agonist; SE: BP). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 221122 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE Preventing loss of limbs: primary or secondary prevention? 213 Traditionally prevention involves foot care advice in diabetic clinics (eg ‘Don’t go bare-foot’), promoting euglycaemia and normotension. But despite this, the sight of a diabetic patient minus one limb is not rare, and must prompt us to redouble our commitment to primary prevention, ie stopping those at risk from ever getting diabetes. The sequelae of diabetic neuropathy can lead to gangrene, amputation, and the impact on quality of life
