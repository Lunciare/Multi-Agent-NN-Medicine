K+ improve mortality? Marburg, Lassa, and CCHF Diff erentiating features are given in table 9.23. Table 9.23 Diff erentiation between VHF VHF Clinical features Marburg Incubation typically 5–9d. Clinically identical disease course to Ebola. Ebola/ Marburg suggested by liver tenderness. Lassa ~80% mild/asymptomatic. Haemorrhage in ~20%. Variable mortality in dif- ferent epidemics 25–80%. Exudative pharyngitis. Convalescent hearing loss. Observational data shows response to ribavarin if given in fi rst 6d. CCHF Tick-borne. Sudden onset prodrome. Haemorrhagic stage common, develops rapidly, but usually short-lived 2–3d. Ribavarin used in treatment (evidence). Risk assessment for VHF in UK Assess for possible transmission and fever. • Transmission: 1 Travel to endemic area (rural for Lassa fever; caves/primates/ante- lopes/bats for Ebola/Marburg; tick/animal slaughter for CCHF). 2 Travel to known outbreak ( 3 Contact with infected specimen. • Fever: >37.5°C in the past 24h. If possible transmission and fever consider ‘high possibility’ (≠high probability), iso- late, PPE (see BOX ‘Equipment’). Inform local infectious disease team and contact the Imported Fever Service (0844 778 8990) for VHF investigation. Bruising, bleeding, and uncontrolled D&V also warrant isolation and discussion if relevant contact history.
