Defi ne clinical syndromes associated with too much or too little secretion (hyper- and hypo-syndromes, respectively; eu- means normal, neither  nor , as in euthyroid). Note factors that may make measurement variable, eg diurnal release of cortisol. • If suspecting hormone defi ciency, test by stimulating the gland that produces it (eg short ACTH stimulation test or Synacthen® test in Addison’s). If the gland is not functioning normally, there will be a blunted response to stimulation. • If suspecting hormone excess, test by inhibiting the gland that produces it (eg dexamethasone suppression test in Cushing’s). If there is a hormone-secreting tumour then this will fail to suppress via normal feedback mechanisms. • Find a way to image the gland. NB: non-functioning tumours or ‘incidentalomas’ may be found in health, see p224. Imaging alone does not make the diagnosis. • Aim to halt disease
