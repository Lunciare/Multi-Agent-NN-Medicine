conjunctivitis in reactive arthritis; scle- ritis or episcleritis in RA, vasculitis, and SLE. Scleritis in RA and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s) may damage the eye. Refer urgently if eye pain. GCA causes optic nerve ischaemia presenting as sudden blindness. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca A reduction in tear formation, tested by the Schirmer fi lter paper test (<5mm in 5min). It causes a gritty feeling in the eyes, and a dry mouth (xerostomia from saliva production). It is found on its own (Sjögren’s syn- drome), or with other diseases, eg SLE, RA, sarcoidosis. : Artifi cial tears/saliva. Hypertensive retinopathy BP damages retinal vessels. Hardened ar- teries are shiny (‘silver wiring’; fi g 12.18) and ‘nip’ veins where they cross (AV nipping; fi g 12.19). Narrowed arterioles may become blocked, causing localized retinal infarction, seen as cotton-wool spots. Leaks from these in severe hyperten- sion manifest as hard exudates or macular oedema. Papilloedema (fi g 12.20) or fl ame haemorrhages suggest accelerated hypertension (p138) requiring urgent treatment. Vascular occlusion Emboli passing through the retinal vasculature may cause retinal artery occlusion (global or segmental retinal pallor) or amaurosis fugax (p476). Roth spots (small retinal infarcts occur in infective endocarditis. In der- matomyositis, there is orbital
