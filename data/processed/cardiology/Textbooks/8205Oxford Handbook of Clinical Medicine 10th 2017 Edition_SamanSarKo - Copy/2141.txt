dialysis). In the event of car- diac arrest, defi brillation is usually unsuccessful if T° <30°C (consider amiodarone, bretylium). Resuscitation must continue until core T° >33°C (OHCS p786). Complications Arrhythmias (if there is a cardiac arrest continue resuscitating until T° >33°C, as cold brains are less damaged by hypoxia); pneumonia; pancreatitis; AKI; DIC. Prognosis: Depends on age and degree of hypothermia. If age >70yrs and T° <32°C then mortality >50%. Before hospital discharge Anticipate problems. Will it happen again? What is their network of support? Review medication (could you stop tranquillizers)? How is progress to be monitored? Liaise with GP/social worker. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 884488 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 849 Fig 19.28 J-wave in hypothermia.

Perhaps this is what Dante had in mind for the last round of the 9th circle of Hell, in which those betraying their benefactors are encased in ice (canto XXXIV) ‘Com’io di- venni allor gelato
