Mediterranean. Incubation: 1–6 months. Signs: Resemble hepatitis A but arthralgia and urticaria are commoner. Tests: HBSAg (surface antigen) is present 1–6 months after exposure. HBeAg (e an- tigen) is present for 1½–3 months after acute illness and implies high infectivity. HBSAg persisting for >6 months defi nes carrier status and occurs in 5–10% of infec- tions; biopsy may be indicated unless ALT and HBV DNA <2000iu/mL. Antibodies to HBCAg (anti-HBc) imply past infection; antibodies to HBSAg (anti-HBs) alone imply vaccination. HBV PCR allows monitoring of response to therapy. See fi g 6.29 and ta- ble 6.11. Vaccination: See p287. Passive immunization (specifi c anti-HBV immuno- globulin) may be given to non-immune contacts after high-risk exposure. Complications: Fulminant hepatic failure, cirrhosis, HCC, cholangiocarcinoma, cryo- globulinaemia, membranous nephropathy, polyarteritis nodosa (p556). : Avoid alcohol. Immunize sexual contacts. Refer all with chronic liver infl amma- tion (eg ALT 30IU/L), cirrhosis, or HBV DNA >2000IU/mL for antivirals (choice is 48 wks pegylated (PEG) interferon alfa-2a vs long-term but better tolerated nucleos(t) ide analogues, eg tenofovir, entecavir). The aim is to clear HBSAg and prevent cir- rhosis and HCC (risk is  if HBSAg and HBeAg +ve). Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA fl avivirus. Spread:
