cysts, size, infections (pyosalpinx), uterine fi broids and other masses. • Testicular masses, hydrocele, varicocele. Advantages: Fast; cheap; independent of renal function; no IV contrast or radiation risk. Disadvantages: Intraluminal masses (transitional cell ca) in the upper tracts may not be seen; not a functional study; only suggests obstruction if there is dilata- tion of the collecting system (95% of obstructed kidneys) and so can miss obstruc- tion from, eg retroperitoneal fi brosis. CT (fi g 16.36) First choice in renal colic. Performed without intravenous contrast so safe in renal impairment; such unenhanced images miss <2% of stones, but can show other pathologies. With IV contrast, CT can delineate masses (cystic or solid, contrast enhancement, calcifi cation, local/distant extension, renal vein involvement); assess renal trauma (presence of two kidneys; haemorrhage; devascularization; laceration; urine leak); and show retroperitoneal lesions. CT has all but replaced intravenous urography and the radiation dose is similar. Plain abdominal X-ray Can be used to look at the kidneys, the paths of the ureters, and bladder. However, in practice it is only useful for monitoring known renal calculi. Contrast studies Retrograde pyelography/ureterograms are good at showing pelvi-calyceal, ureteric anatomy, and transitional cell carcinomas (TCCS). Contrast medium is
