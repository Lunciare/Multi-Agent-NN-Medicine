Genetic testing is appropriate if the sensitivity and specifi city of the test are good enough, and if the result of the test will impact diagnosis and management (see p27). Breast/ovarian cancer ~5–10% of breast cancers are due to mutations in BRCA1 (17q) or BRCA2 (13q).4,5 Both genes function as tumour suppressors although they are dominant: a cancer phenotype can be seen when one copy of the gene is normal. A BRCA1 mutation confers a 55–65% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 39% risk of ovarian cancer. For BRCA2, the risk of breast cancer is 45% (6% in aff ected males), and 11% for ovarian cancer. Mutations are also linked to prostate, peritoneal, and pancreatic cancers. TP53 mutations (somatic >inherited) also confer a risk of breast cancer. Refer if:
