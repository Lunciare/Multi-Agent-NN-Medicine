An existential approach to diffi cult symptoms The manner in which management is discussed is almost as important as the management itself, which should focus on education of the patient and their fam- ily and on developing coping strategies. Such a diagnosis may be a relief or a disappointment to the patient. Explain that fi bromyalgia is a relapsing and re- mitting condition, with no easy cures, and that they will continue to have good and bad days. Reassure them that there is no serious underlying pathology, that their joints are not being damaged, and that no further tests are necessary, but be sympathetic to the fact that they may have been seeking a physical cause for their symptoms. We all at some stage come across a patient with diffi cult symptoms and an exasperating lack of pathology to explain them.
