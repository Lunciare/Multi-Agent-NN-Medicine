pupil changes indicating a IIIrd nerve palsy with a posterior communicating artery aneurysm) or intracerebral haematoma. Later defi cits suggest complications (see later in topic). Causes • Berry aneurysm rupture (80%). Common sites: junctions of poster ior communicating with the internal carotid (see fi g 10.3, p451) or of the anterior com- municating with the anterior cerebral artery, or bifurcation of the middle cerebral artery (fi g 10.17). 15% are multiple. •Arterio-venous malforma tions (15%).• Other causes; encephalitis, vasculitis, tumour (invading blood vessels), idiopathic. Risk factors Previous aneurysmal SAH (new aneurysms form, old ones get bigger), smoking, alcohol misuse, BP, bleeding disorders, SBE (mycotic aneurysm), family his- tory (3–5x risk of SAH in close relatives). Polycystic kidneys, aortic coarctation, and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (p149) are all associated with berry aneurysms. Diff erentials Meningitis (p822), migraine (p458), intracerebral bleed, cortical vein thrombosis (p480), dissection of a carotid or vertebral artery, benign thunderclap headache (triggered by Valsalva manoeuvre, eg cough, coitus). Tests • Urgent CT: Detects >95% of SAH within the 1st 24h (fi g 10.18). • Consider LP: If CT Ωve but the history is very suggestive of SAH (and no CI: p768). This needs to be done >12h after headache onset
