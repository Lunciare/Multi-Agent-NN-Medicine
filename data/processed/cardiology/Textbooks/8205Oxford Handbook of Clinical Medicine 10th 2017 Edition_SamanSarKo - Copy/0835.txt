and irregular kidneys. IVU: classic ‘cup and spill’ appearance. Non-contrast CT: renal mass, papillary cal- cifi cation. Biopsy: CTIN secondary to papillary necrosis. Risk of atherosclerosis. Treatment: Discontinue analgesia. Manage CKD (pp304–5). USS or CT urogram if sudden fl ank pain to exclude obstruction from sloughed papilla. Aminoglycosides (gentamicin >tobramycin >amikacin >streptomycin) Cause AKI due to tubular necrosis. Risk factors: dose, prolonged use, CKD, volume depletion, other nephrotoxins. Presentation: Typically mild, non-oliguric AKI after 1–2 weeks of therapy. Recovery can be delayed/incomplete. Treatment: Prevention. Single daily dose may be less nephrotoxic Check levels (p756). Radiocontrast nephropathy AKI 48–72 hours after IV contrast. Risk factors: CKD, DM, dose of contrast, volume depletion, other nephrotoxins. Treatment: None. Prevention is key: pre-hydrate with IV cystalloid (no consistent benefi t shown for bicarbonate above 0.9% sodium chloride). Use local protocol or consider 3mL/kg/h 1 hour before, and 1mL/kg/h for 6h after. Acetylcysteine evidence is weak. Discontinue other nephrotoxic medication for 24h pre- and post-procedure. Tell the radiologist about risk factors so they can use the lowest dose of low/iso-osmolar contrast. Rhabdomyolysis Results from skeletal muscle breakdown, with release of intracellular contents (K+, myoglobin) into the extracellular space. Cytokines and nitric oxide cause renal vasoconstriction.
