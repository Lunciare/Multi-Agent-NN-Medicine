cophenolate, glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab. Small vessel vasculitis Multiple classifi cation systems exist. Clinical phenotype and ANCA subtype are im- portant. ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) occurs with or without specifi city for pro- teinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). AAV classically presents at an older age (>60yrs) and accounts for 20% of biopsy fi ndings >80yrs. Ask about lethargy, fever, myalgia, anorexia (‘When did you last feel well?’). Ask about respiratory symptoms and investigate for pulmonary haemorrhage. Diagnosis: Clinical + ANCA + biopsy: rapidly progressive GN (p311) without immune deposits (‘pauci-immune’). Treatment: High-dose glucocorticoids plus cyclophosphamide or rituximab. Plasma exchange if presents with renal failure or pulmonary haemorrhage. Myeloma (See p368.) Associated renal disease in up to 40%: tubular obstruction due to light chain casts (‘myeloma kidney’); deposition of Ig/light chains in glomerulus (causes proteinuria); hypercalcaemia; renal tract infection due to immunoparesis. Treatment: Adequate hydration, bisphosphonates for hypercalcaemia (care if GFR <30), anti-myeloma treatment including glucocorticoids. It remains unclear whether there is a benefi t in removing light chains by either plasma exchange or large pore haemodialysis. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 331144 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR Amyloid 315 Pathological folding of proteins leads to extracellular accumulation and organ dys- function including kidney disease.
