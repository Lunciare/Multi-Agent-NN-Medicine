ventricle to the aorta. To power the pump, the patient attaches the device to the mains electricity, and uses batteries when out and about. Patients with continuous (rather than pulsatile) fl ow LVADs have no pulse (fi g 3.39c) and ascultation will reveal a loud, continuous, mechanical hum. If the patient collapses and there is no hum, resuscitation should include checking the LVAD power supply! (b) (a) (c) Fig 3.39 (a) CXR of a patient with a continuous fl ow LVAD. Blood is taken from the LV apex and pumped into the aorta. (b) Retinal fl ow velocity trace from a normal subject—large peaks in fl ow rate during systole. (c) Retinal fl ow velocity trace from a patient with an LVAD. The fl ow rate only slightly rises during systole as the fl ow from the LVAD is continuous.

Natriuretic peptides Secretory granules have long been known to exist in the atria, and if hom ogenized atrial tissue is injected into rats, their urine volume (and Na+ excretion) rises; this is because of atrial natriuretic
