They are aff ected in this order: growth hormone (GH), gonadotropins: follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and adreno corticotrophic hormone (ACTH), prolactin (PRL). Panhypop ituitarism is defi cien- cy of all anterior hormones, usually caused by irradiation, surgery, or pituitary tumour. Causes are at three levels. 1 Hypothalamus: Kallman’s syndrome (p231), tumour, infl amm ation, infection (meningitis, TB), ischaemia. 2 Pituitary stalk: Trauma, sur- gery, mass lesion (craniopharyngioma, p234), meningioma, carotid artery aneurysm. 3 Pituitary: Tumour, irradiation, infl ammation, autoimmunity,7 infi ltration (haemo- chromatosis, amyl oid, metastases), ischaemia (pituitary apoplexy, p234; DIC 8; Shee- han’s syndrome9). Features are due to: 1 Hormone lack: •GH: central obesity, atherosclerosis, dry wrinkly skin, strength, bala nce, well-being, exercise ability, cardiac output, osteoporosis, glucose. •Gonadotropin (FSH; LH):  oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea, fertility, libido, os- teoporosis, breast atrophy, dyspareunia.  Erectile dysfunction, libido, muscle bulk, hypogonadism (hair, all over; small testes; ejaculate volume; spermatogenesis). •Thyroid: as for hypothyroidism (p220). •Corticotropin: as
