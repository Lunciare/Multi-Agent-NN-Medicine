if heavy contami- nation. If vaccination history unknown/incomplete: TIG plus dose of vaccine in a dif- ferent site. Precautionary travel booster if >10y since last dose. Poliomyelitis A highly infectious picornavirus, transmitted via faeco–oral route or contaminated food/water. Replicates in intestine. Invades nervous system with destruction of an- terior horn cells/brain stemirreversible paralysis. Incidence by 99% since forma- tion of Global Polio Eradication Initiative in 1988. 74 cases in 2015. Remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan (2016).12 Presentation: Incubation 7–10d. Flu-like pro- drome in ~25%. Pre-paralytic stage: fever, HR, headache, vomiting, neck stiff ness, tremor, limb pain. ~1 in 200 progress to paralytic stage: LMN/bulbar signs ± respira- tory failure. No sensory signs. Post-polio syndrome in ~40% of survivors (up to 40y later): new progressive muscle weakness, myalgia, fatigue. Diagnosis: Viral culture of stool (most sensitive, 2 samples >24h apart), pharyn- geal swabs, blood, CSF. PCR can diff erentiate wild-type from vaccine. Paired serol- ogy. Treatment: None. Vaccination: Salk (inactivated, IM) or Sabin (live, oral). In previously endemic areas 200 million volunteers have vaccinated 3 billion children, preventing 1.5 million deaths in the last 20y. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 443366 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 sesaesid suoitcefnI Rabies 437 Rhabdovirus transmitted through saliva or CNS tissue,
