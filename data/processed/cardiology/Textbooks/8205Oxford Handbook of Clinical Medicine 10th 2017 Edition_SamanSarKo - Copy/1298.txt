compl icated by aberrant reconnect ions: synkinesis, eg eye blinking causes synchronous upturn- ing of the mouth; misconnection of parasympathetic fi bres (red in fi g 10.26) can produce crocodile tears (gusto–lacrimal refl ex) when eating stimu lates unilateral lacrimation, not salivation. Management Drugs: If given within 72h of onset, prednisolone (eg 60mg/d PO for 5d, tailing by 10mg/d) speeds recovery, with 95% making a full recovery. Antivirals (eg aciclovir) don’t help; although some cases are thought to be associated with HSV–1, no one has shown actively replicating virus. There are little data to guide treat- ment if presenting after 72h of onset, but corticos teroids are widely used (though SE, p377). No advice on the use of steroids is universally agreed in pregnancy. Protect the eye: • Dark glasses and artifi cial tears (eg hyprom ellose) if evidence of drying. • Encourage regular eyelid closure by pulling down the lid by hand. • Use tape to close the eyes at night. Surgery: Consider if eye closure remains a long-term prob- lem (lagophthalmos) or ectropion is severe. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 550000 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 501 1 Facial nerve nucleus, 8 Sphenopalatine ganglion 16 Chorda tympani deep in reticular form- 9 Superior maxillary
