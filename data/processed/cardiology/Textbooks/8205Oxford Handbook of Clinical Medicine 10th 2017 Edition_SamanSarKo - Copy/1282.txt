at obstacles or doors (due to poor simulta- neous motor and cognitive function). Expressionless face. Causes Fig 10.25 ‘Marche à petit pas.’ Parkinson’s disease (PD): Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, associated with Lewy bodies in the basal ganglia, brain- stem, and cortex. Most cases are sporadic, though multiple genetic loci have been identifi ed in familial cases. Mean age at onset is 60yrs. Prevalence:  with age: 3.5% at 85–89yrs. Clinical features: The parkinsonian triad, plus non-motor symptoms such as: autonomic dysfunction (postural hypotension, constipation, urinary fre- quency/urgency, dribbling of saliva), sleep disturbance, and reduced sense of smell. Neuropsychiatric complications, such as depression, dementia, and psychosis, are common and debilitating. Diagnosis: Is clinical and based on the core features of bradykinesia with resting tremor and/or hypertonia; cerebellar disease and fronto- temporal dementia should be excluded; a clinical response to dopaminergic therapy is supportive. Signs are invariably worse on one side—if symmetrical look for other causes. If an alternative cause is suspected then consider MRI to rule out structural pathology. Functional neuroimaging (DaTscan™, PET) is playing an emerging role. Treatment: Focuses on symptom control and does not slow disease progression (see BOX). Non-pharmacological options include deep brain stimulation
