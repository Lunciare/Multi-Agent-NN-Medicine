pruritus. Useful if ACE-i induces cough. -blockers: Eg biso- prolol 2.5–5mg/24h PO. SE: bronchospasm, heart failure, cold peripheries, lethargy, impotence. CI: asthma; caution in heart failure. Consider aspirin when BP controlled, if aged >55yrs. Add a statin if cholesterol raised. Most drugs take 4–8wks to gain maximum eff ect: don’t assess effi cacy with just one BP measurement. Malignant hypertension (fi g 3.41) In general, use oral therapy, unless there is encephal opathy or CCF. The aim is for a controlled reduction in BP over days, not hours. Avoid sudden drops in BP as cerebral autoregulation is poor (stroke risk). Bed rest; there is no ideal hypotensive, but atenolol or long-acting Ca2+ blockers may be used PO. Encephalopathy: (Headache, focal CNS signs, seizures, coma.) Aim to reduce BP to ~110mmHg diastolic over 4h. Admit to monitored area. Insert intra-arterial line for pressure monitoring. Either IV labetalol (eg 50mg IV over 1min, repeated every 5min, max 200mg) or sodium nitroprusside infusion (0.5mcg/kg/min IVI titrated up to 8mcg/kg/min, eg 50mg in 1L glucose 5%; expect to give 100–200mL/h for a few hours only, to avoid cyanide risk). Never use sublingual nifedipine to reduce BP (rapid drop in BP may cause stroke ).
