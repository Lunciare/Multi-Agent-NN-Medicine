naemia—start slowly 0.05u/kg/h. Keep blood glucose at least 10–15mmol/L for fi rst 24 hours to avoid cerebral oedema. Look for the cause, eg MI, drugs, sepsis, or bowel infarct. Lactic acidosis A rare but serious complication of DM with metformin use or septi- caemia. Blood lactate: >5mmol/L. Seek expert help. Treat sepsis vigorously, maintain blood pressure and hence tissue perfusion. Stop metformin. Thyroid emergencies Myxoedema coma The ultimate hypothyroid state before death. Signs and symptoms: Looks hypothyroid (p220, p221, fi g 5.16); often >65yrs; hypother- mia; hyporefl exia; glucose; bradycardia; coma; seizures. May have had radioiodine, thyroidectomy, or pituitary surgery (signs of hypopituitarism, p232). Psychosis (myxo- edema madness) may precede coma. Precipitants: infection, MI, stroke, or trauma. Examination: Goitre; cyanosis; BP (cardiogenic); heart failure; signs of precipitants. Treatment: Preferably on ICU. • Blood for: T3, T4, TSH, FBC, U&E (often Na+), cultures, cortisol, glucose. • ABG for PaO2. High-fl ow O2 if cyanosed. Ventilation may be needed. • Correct any hypoglycaemia. • Give T3 (liothyronine) 5–20mcg/12h IV slowly. Be cautious: you may precipitate man- ifestations of ischaemic heart disease. Alternative regimens involve levothyroxine. • Give hydrocortisone 100mg/8h IV—vital if pituitary hypothyroidism is suspected (ie no goitre, no previous radioiodine, and
