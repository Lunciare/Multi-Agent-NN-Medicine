1% lidocaine; scalpel; suture; Seldinger chest drain kit; underwater drainage bottle; connection tubes; sterile H2O; dressings. Incontinence pad under patient. • Choose insertion site: 4–6th intercostal space, anterior- to mid-axillary line—the ‘safe triangle’ (see BOX ‘The “safe triangle” for insertion’ and fi g 18.7). A more pos- terior approach, eg the 7th space posteriorly, may be required to drain a locu- lated eff usion (under direct US visualization) and occasionally the 2nd intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line may be used for apical pneumothoraces—how- ever, both approaches tend to be less comfortable. • Maintain sterile technique—clean and place sterile drapes. Scrub for insertion. • Prepare your underwater drain by fi lling the bottle to the marked line with ster- ile water. Ensure this is kept sterile until you need it. • Infi ltrate down to pleura with 10mL of 1% lidocaine and a 21G needle. Check that air/fl uid can be aspirated from the proposed insertion site; if not, do not proceed. • Attach the Seldinger needle to the syringe containing 1–2mL of sterile saline. The needle is bevelled and will direct the guidewire; in general advance bevel up for pneumothoraces, bevel down for eff usions. • Insert the needle
