1–2yr if cardiac failure. If moderate-to-severe and treated medi- cally, mortality can be as high as 50% at 2yrs, therefore prompt valve replacement (p148) is usually recommended. In asymptomatic patients with severe AS and a dete- riorating ECG, valve replacement is also recommended. If the patient is not medically fi t for surgery, percutaneous valvuloplasty/replacement (TAVI = transcatheter aortic valve implantation) may be attempted (fi g 3.45). Aortic sclerosis Senile degeneration of the valve. There is an ejection systolic mur- mur; but no carotid radiation, and normal pulse (character and volume) and S2. Aortic regurgitation (AR) Acute: Infective endocarditis, ascending aortic dis- section, chest trauma. Chronic: Congenital, connective tissue disorders (Marfan’s syndrome, Ehlers–Danlos), rheumatic fever, Takayasu arteritis, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, appetite suppressants (eg fenfl uramine, phenter- mine), seronegative arthritides (ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter’s syndrome, psor iatic arthropathy), hypert ension, osteogenesis imperfecta, syphilitic aortitis. Symptoms: Exertional dyspnoea, orthopnoea, and PND. Also: palpitations, angina, syncope, CCF. Signs: Collapsing (water-hammer) pulse (p42); wide pulse pressure; displaced, hyperdynamic apex beat; high-pitc hed early diastolic murmur (heard best in expiration, with patient sat forward). Eponyms: Corrigan’s sign: carotid pulsation; de Musset’s sign: head nodding with each heart beat; Quincke’s sign: capillary pulsa- tions in
