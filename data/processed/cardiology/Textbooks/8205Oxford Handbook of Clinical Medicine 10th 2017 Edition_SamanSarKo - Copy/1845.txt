Some patients express PANCA specifi c for MPO. ESR/CRP. Urinalysis should be per- formed to look for proteinuria or haematuria. If these are present, consider a renal biopsy. CXR may show nodules ± fl uff y infi ltrates of pulmonary haemorrhage. CT may reveal diff use alveolar haemorrhage. Atypical cells from cytology of sputum/BAL can be confused with bronchial carcinoma.66 Treatment: Depends on the extent of disease. Severe disease (eg biopsy-proven renal disease) should be treated with cor- ticosteroids and cyclophosphamide (or rituximab) to induce remission. Azathioprine and methotrexate are usually used as maintenance. Indications for plasma exchange include patients presenting with severe renal disease (eg creatinine >500μmol/L) and those with pulmonary haemorrhage. Co-trimoxazole should be given as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii and staphylococcal colonization.
