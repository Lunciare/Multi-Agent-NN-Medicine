while in a warm bath, for example, may help to distinguish from maldescended/ectopic testes). • Maldescended testis: May be found anywhere along the normal path of descent from abdomen to groin. • Ectopic testis: Most commonly found in the superior inguinal pouch (anterior to the external oblique aponeurosis) but may also be abdominal, perineal, penile, and in the femoral triangle. Complications of maldescended and ectopic testis Infertility; ≈40 increased risk of testicular cancer (risk remains after surgery but in cryptorchidism may be  if or- chidopexy performed before aged 10), increased risk of testicular trauma, increased risk of testicular torsion. Also associated with hernias (due to patent processus vagi- nalis in >90%, p613) and other urinary tract anomalies. Treatment of maldescended and ectopic testis restores (potential for) spermat- ogenesis; the increased risk of malignancy remains but becomes easier to diagnose. Surgery: Orchidopexy, usually dartos pouch procedure, is performed in infancy: testis and cord are mobilized following a groin incision, any processus vaginalis or hernial sac is removed and the testis is brought through a hole made in the dartos muscle into the resultant subcutaneous pouch where the muscle prevents retraction. Hormonal: Hormonal therapy, most commonly human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), is
