can be justifi able; individualize risk and check local guidelines. In particular, check which criteria used to estimate degree of stenosis since NASCET (North American Sympto- matic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) criteria tend to include some more severe lesions in 50–69% range as compared to the ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trialists’ Collaborative Group) criteria. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 447722 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN Cardiac causes of stroke 473 Cardioembolic causes are the source of stroke in >30% of patients, and may be hinted at if there are bilateral infarcts on imaging. Non-valvular atrial fi brillation: (p130) Associated with an overall risk of stroke of 4.5%/yr, and ischaemic strokes in AF carry a worse prognosis. • CHA2DS2VASC score (p131) can be used to calculate risk of stroke in patients with AF. Off er anticoagulation in patients with a score of 2 or above. Take bleeding risk into account: calculate the risk of major bleeding using the HAS-BLED score. Caution and regular review of oral anticoagulants are required if the HAS-BLED score >3.  Do not off er stroke prevention therapy in patients with AF if <65y and CHA2DS2VASC score is 0 for men or 1 for women. • Anticoagulation (see p350) can be commenced 2wks after
