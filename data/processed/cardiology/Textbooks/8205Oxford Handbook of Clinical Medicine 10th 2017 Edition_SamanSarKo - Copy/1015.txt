have sensitivity, so treat on suspicion. • Genitourinary TB: Symptoms may be chronic, intermittent, or silent. Include dysuria, freque ncy, loin pain, haematuria, sterile pyuria (see p296). Granuloma may cause fi brosis, strictures, infertility, and genital ulceration. • Cardiac TB: Usually involves the pericardium: pericarditis, pericardial eff usion, and/or constrictive pericarditis (p154). Check chest imaging for other TB pathol- ogy, eg pulmonary disease, mediastinal lymph nodes. Pericardiectomy may be indicated for persistent constriction despite anti-tuberculous treatment. Myo- cardial involvement (arrhythmias, heart failure, ventricular aneurysm, or outfl ow obstruction) is rare. • Skin: Lupus vulgaris = persistent, progressive, cutaneous TB: red-brown, ‘apple- jelly’ nodules. Scrofuloderma: skin lesion extended from underlying infection eg lymph node, bone; causes ulceration and scarring. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 339933 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI 394 Tuberculosis (TB): diagnosis and treatment Diagnostic tests for TB Latent TB: Off er testing3 to close contacts of those with pulmonary or laryngeal TB, those with immune dysfunction, healthcare workers, and high-risk populations, eg pris- on, homeless, vulnerable migrants. • Tuberculin skin testing (TST) = Mantoux test.
