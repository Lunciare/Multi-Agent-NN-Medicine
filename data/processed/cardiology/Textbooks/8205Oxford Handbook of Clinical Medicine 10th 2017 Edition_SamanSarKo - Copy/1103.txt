(louse-borne, sub-Saharan Africa, refu- gee camps) or other Borrelia (tick-borne, world-wide). Presentation: Intermittent fever ‘crisis’ due to antigenic variation (~3d fever, then afebrile ~7d), headache, myalgia, BP. Diagnosis: Spirochaetes on blood smear, false +ve serology for Lyme disease. Treatment: Doxycyline/macrolides (single dose if louse-borne). Neuroborre- liosis treatment if CNS disease (p422). Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction due to endotoxins (?TNF) can mimic fever ‘crisis’: observe 1st ~4h treatment, use cooling/antipyretics. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 442233 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI 424 Zoonoses Anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) Gram-positive, aerobic bacillus found in soil worldwide. Humans exposed via infect- ed livestock or animal products, eg hide, wool, tusks. Infection via inhalation, inges- tion, contamination of broken skin (includes IV drug use). Bacteria secrete exotoxins: oedema toxin and lethal toxin. Presentation: • Cutaneous (~95%): itchy papulevesiclenecrotic eschar. Oedema may be strik- ing. Regional lymphadenopathy, malaise. • Inhalation: fever, cough, myalgia, SOB, pleural eff usion (haemorrhagic mediastini- tis), stridor, death. • GI (rare): fever, abdominal pain, ascites, mucosal ulcers, GI perforation. Diagnosis: Vesicular fl uid culture (care, do not disseminate), blood culture, anti- body ELISA, PCR. (NB: not pneumonic so sputum cultures are Ωve). Treatment: Qui- nolone/doxycycline. Two agents if systemic disease, eg ciprofl oxacin+clindamycin or linezolid (then narrow according to sensitivity).
