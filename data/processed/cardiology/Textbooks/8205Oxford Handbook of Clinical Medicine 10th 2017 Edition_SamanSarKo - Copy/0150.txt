Other features include ankle oedema, lung crepitations, and JVP. • Anatomical—eg diseases of the chest wall, muscles, pleura. Ascites can cause breathlessness by splinting the diaphragm, restricting its movement. • Others Any shocked patient may also be dyspnoeic (p790 & p607)—dyspnoea may be shock’s presenting feature. Also anaemia or metabolic acidosis caus- ing respiratory compensation, eg ketoacidosis, aspirin poisoning. Look for other clues—dyspnoea at rest unassociated with exertion, may be psychogenic: pro- longed hyperventilation causes respiratory alkalosis. This causes a fall in ion ized calcium leading to apparent hypocalcaemia. Features include peripheral and perioral paraesthesiae ± carpopedal spasm.
