hypercapnia. Consider verapamil if rate remains >110bpm. Junctional tachycardia: Where anterograde conduction through the AV node oc- curs, vagal manoeuvres are worth trying. Adenosine will usually cardiovert a junc- tional rhythm to sinus rhythm. If it fails or recurs, -blockers (or verapamil—not with -blockers, digoxin, or class I agents such as quinidine). If this does not control symptoms, consider radiofrequency ablation. Seek specialist advice if resistant junction tachycardia, or accessory pathway. Wolff -Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (ECG p133, fi g 3.37.) Caused by congenital accessory conduction pathway between atria and ventricles. Resting ECG shows short PR interval and widened QRS complex due to slurred upstroke or ‘delta wave’. Two types: WPW type A (+ve  wave in V1), WPW type B (–ve  wave in V1). Present with SVT which may be due to an AVRT (p126), pre-excited AF, or pre-excited atrial fl utter. Risk of degeneration to VF and sudden death. : Flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodar- one. Refer to cardiologist for electrophysiology and ablation of the accessory pathway. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 880066 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE  Management of narrow complex tachycardia 807 (supraventricular tachycardia) Give O2 if SaO2 <90%, get IV access & 12-lead ECG Adverse signs? • Shock • Chest
