Risk of recurrence decreases from 30% to <10% at 10yrs and increases overall survival. Axillary radiotherapy used if lymph node +ve on sampling and surgical clearance not performed (risk of lymphoedema and brachial plexopathy). SE: pneumonitis, pericarditis, and rib fractures. •Chemotherapy: Adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival and reduces recurrence in most groups of women (consider in all except excellent prognosis patients), eg epirubicin + ‘CMF’ (cyclophosphamide + methotrex- ate + 5-FU). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has shown no diff erence in survival but may facilitate breast-conserving surgery. •Endocrine agents: Aim to  oestr ogen activity and are used in oestrogen receptor (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) +ve disease. The ER blocker tamoxifen is widely used, eg 20mg/d PO for 5yrs post-op (may rarely cause uterine cancer so warn to report vaginal bleeding). Aromatase inhibitors (eg anastrozole) targeting peripheral oestrogen synthesis are also used (may be better tolerated). They are only used if post-menopausal. If pre-menopausal and an ER+ve tumour, ovarian ablation (via surgery or radiotherapy) or GnRH anal ogues (eg gos- erelin)  recurrence and  survival. • Support: Breastcare nurses •Reconstruction options: Eg tissue expanders/implants/nipple tattoos, latissimus dorsi fl ap, TRAM (transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous) fl ap. Treating distant disease (Stage 3–4.)8
