is required (p192, p766). Empyema Pus in the pleural space. It should be suspected if a patient with a resolv- ing pneumonia develops a recurrent fever. Clinical features: CXR indicates a pleural eff usion. The aspirated pleural fl uid is typically yellow and turbid with a pH <7.2, glucose, and LDH. The empyema should be drained using a chest drain, inserted under radiological guidance. Adhesions and loculation can make this diffi cult. Lung abscess A cavitating area of localized, suppurative infection within the lung (see fi g 4.6). Causes: •Inadequately treated pneumonia. •Aspiration (eg alcoholism, oesopha geal obstruction, bulbar palsy). •Bronchial obstruction (tumour, foreign body). •Pulmo- nary infarction. •Septic emboli (septicaemia, right heart endocarditis, IV drug use). •Subphrenic or hepatic abscess. Clinical features: Swinging fever; cough; purulent, foul-smelling sputum; pleuritic chest pain; haemoptysis; malaise; weight loss. Look for: fi nger clubbing; anaemia; crepitations. Empyema develops in 20–30%. Tests: Blood: FBC (anaemia, neutrophilia), ESR, CRP, blood cultures. Sputum micros- copy, culture, and cytology. CXR: walled cavity, often with a fl uid level. Consider CT scan to exclude obstruction, and bronchoscopy to obtain diagn ostic specimens. Treatment: Antibiotics as indicated by sensitivities; continue until healed (4–6 wks). Postural drainage. Repeated aspiration, antibiotic
