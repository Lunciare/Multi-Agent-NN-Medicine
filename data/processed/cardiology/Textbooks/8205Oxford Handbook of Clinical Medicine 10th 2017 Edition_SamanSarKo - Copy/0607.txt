is common.) Pregnancy may be normal; signs and chemistry may remit. Monitor glucose. Tests Glucose, Ca2+, and PO43Ω. GH: Don’t rely on random GH as secreti on is pulsatile and during peaks acromega lic and normal levels overlap. GH also  in: stress, sleep, puberty, and pregnancy. Normally GH secretion is inhibited by high glucose, and GH hardly detectable. In acromegaly GH release fails to suppress. • If basal serum GH is >0.4mcg/L (1.2mIU/L) and/or if IGF-I (p232), an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is needed. If the lowest GH value during OGTT is above 1mcg/L (3mIU/L), acrom egaly is con- fi rmed. With general use of very sensitive assays, it has been said that this cut-off be decreased to 0.3mcg/L (0.9mIU/L).28 Method: Collect samples for GH glucose at: 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150min. Possible false +ves: puberty, pregnancy, hepatic and renal disease, anorexia nervosa, and DM. • MRI scan of pituitary fossa. • Look for hypopituitarism (p232). • Visual fi elds and acuity. • ECG, echo. Old photos if possible. Treatment Aim to correct (or prevent) tumour compression by excising the lesion, and to reduce GH and IGF-I levels to at least a ‘safe’ GH level of <2mcg/L
