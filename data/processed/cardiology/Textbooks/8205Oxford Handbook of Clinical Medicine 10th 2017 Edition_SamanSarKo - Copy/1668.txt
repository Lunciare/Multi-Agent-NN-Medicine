excellent disease-free survival (laparoscopic surgery is as good). The role of adjuvant hormonal therapy is being explored. •Radical radiotherapy (± neoadjuvant & adjuvant hormonal therapy) is an alternative curative option that compares favourably with surgery (no RCTS). It may be delivered as external beam or brachytherapy. •Hormone therapy alone temporar- ily delays tumour progression but refractory disease eventually develops. Consider in elderly, unfi t patients with high-risk disease. •Active surveillance—particularly if >70yrs and low-risk. Metastatic disease: •Hormonal drugs may give benefi t for 1–2yrs. LHRH agonists, eg 12-weekly goserelin (10.8mg SC) fi rst stimulate, then inhibit pituitary gonadotrophin. NB: risks tumour ‘fl are’ when fi rst used—start anti-androgen, eg cypro- terone acetate, in susceptible patients. The LHRH antagonist degarelix is also used in advanced disease. Symptomatic : Analgesia; treat hypercalca emia; radiotherapy for bone mets/spinal cord compression. Prognosis: 10% die in 6 months, 10% live >10yrs. Screening: DRE of prostate; transrectal US; PSA (see BOX ‘Advice to asymptomatic men’). Penile cancer Epidemiology: Rare in UK, more common in Far East and Africa, very rare in circumcised. Related to chronic irritation, viruses, smegma. Presentation: Chronic fungating ulcer, bloody/purulent discharge, 50% spread to lymph at presentation : Radiotherapy & irridium wires if
