curing disease that they ignore the foundations of good health—mal- nourished patients recover more slowly and experience more complications. See table 13.6. Why are so many hospital patients malnourished? 1 Increased nutritional requirements (eg sepsis, burns, surgery). 2 Increased nutritional losses (eg malabsorption, output from stoma). 3 Decreased intake (eg dysphagia, nausea, sedation, coma). 4 Eff ect of treatment (eg nausea, diarrhoea). 5 Enforced starvation (eg prolonged periods nil by mouth). 6 Missing meals (eg due to investigations—minimize meal time disruption). 7 Diffi culty with feeding(eg lost dentures;no one available to assist). 8 Unappetizing food. Identifying at-risk patients Assess nutrition state (using eg Malnutrition Univer- sal Screening Tool3) and weight on admission; reassess weekly thereafter. Involve dieticians early in those at risk. • History: Recent weight (>20%, accounting for fl uid balance); recent reduced in- take; diet change (eg recent change in consistency of food); nausea, vomiting, pain, diarrhoea which might have led to reduced intake. • Examination: State of hydration (p666): dehydration can go hand-in-hand with malnutrition, and overhydration can mask malnutrition. Evidence of malnutrition: skin hanging off muscles (eg over biceps); no fat between fold of skin; hair rough and wiry; pressure sores; sores at corner of mouth.
