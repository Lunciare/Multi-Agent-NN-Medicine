uncooperative, squirt glucose gel between teeth and gums. In unconscious patients, or those not responding to these measures, start glucose IVI (eg 10% at 200mL/h if con- scious; 10% at 200mL/15mins if unconscious), or give glucagon 1mg IV/IM (will not work in malnourished patients). Expect prompt recovery. Once blood glucose >4.0mmol/L and patient has recovered, give long-acting carbohydrate (eg slice of toast). Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar state (HHS) Seen in unwell patients with type 2 DM.17 The history is longer (eg 1wk), with marked dehydration and glucose >30mmol/L. There is no switch to ketone metabolism, so ketonaemia stays <3mmol/L and pH >7.3. Osmolality is typically >320mosmol/kg: Occlusive events are a danger (focal CNS signs, chorea, DIC, leg ischaemia/rhabdomyolysis)—give LMWH prophylaxis to all unless contraindication (p350). Rehydrate slowly with 0.9% saline IVI over 48h, typical defi cits are 110–220mL/ kg, ie 8–15L for a 70kg adult. Replace K+ when urine starts to fl ow (see DKA BOX, p833). Only use insulin if blood glucose not falling by 5mmol/L/h with rehydration or if keto- naemia—start slowly 0.05u/kg/h. Keep blood glucose at least 10–15mmol/L for fi rst 24 hours to avoid cerebral oedema. Look for the cause, eg MI, drugs, sepsis, or bowel infarct. Lactic
