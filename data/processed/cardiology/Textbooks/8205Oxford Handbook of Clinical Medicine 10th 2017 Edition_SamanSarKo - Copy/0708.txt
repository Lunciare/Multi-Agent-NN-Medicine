as prophylaxis against stress ulceration, eg omeprazole 40mg/d IV/PO. • Liaise early with nearest transplant centre regarding appropriateness. Treat complications Cerebral oedema: On ITU: 20% mannitol IV; hyperventilate. Ascites: Restrict fl uid, low-salt diet, weigh daily, diuretics (p276). Bleeding: Vitamin K 10mg/d IV for 3d, platelets, FFP + blood as needed ± endoscopy. Blind  of infection: Ceftriaxone 1–2g/24h IV, not gentamicin (risk of renal failure). Blood glucose: If 2mmol/L or symptomatic,  50mL of 50% glucose IV; check often. Encephalopathy: Avoid sedatives; 20° head-up tilt in ITU; correct electrolytes; lactulose 30–50mL/8h (aim for 2–4 soft stools/d) is catabolized by bacterial fl ora to short-chain fatty acids which colonic pH and trap NH 3 in the colon as NH 4+ ; Rifaximin 550mg/12h is a non-absorbable oral antibiotic that  numbers of nitrogen- forming gut bacteria. Worse prognosis if Grade III–IV encephalopathy, age >40yrs, albumin <30g/L, INR, drug-induced liver failure, late-onset hepatic failure worse than fulminant failure. 26 Neutrophilic leucocytosis need not mean a secondary infection: alcoholic hepatitis may be the cause. 27 Urea is synthesized in the liver, so is a poor test of renal function in liver failure; use creatinine instead. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 227744 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG Prescribing in
