Surgical drains in the post-operative period The decision when to insert and remove drains may seem to be one of the great surgical enigmas—but there are basically three types to get a grip of: 1 To drain the area of surgery and are often put under suction or Ωve pressure (Redivac® uses a ‘high vacuum’). These are removed when they stop draining. They protect against collection, haematoma, and seroma formation(in breast surgery this can cause overlying skin necrosis). 2 To protect sites where leakage may occur in post-operative period, eg bowel anastomoses. These form a tract and are removed after about 1wk. 3 To collect red blood cells from the site of the operation, which can then be autotransfused within 6h, protecting from the hazards of allotransfusion—it is used commonly in orthopaedics. (eg Bellovac®). ‘Shortening a drain’ means withdrawing it (eg by 2cm/d) to allow the tract to seal, bit by bit. Check the surgeon’s wishes before
