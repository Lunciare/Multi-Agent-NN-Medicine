blood group A, H. pylori (p252), atrophic gastritis, adenomatous polyps, lower social class, smoking, diet (high nitrate, high salt, pickling, low vitamin C), nitrosamine exposure. Pathology A range of clinical and histological classifi cations are in use. Of note, ‘early’ gastric carcinoma (confi ned to mucosa and submucosa) carries a better prognosis with endoscopic resection often possible. Presentation Symptoms: Often non-specifi c. Dyspepsia (p59; age ≥55yrs with treatment-refractory symptoms demands investigation), weight, vomiting, dyspha- gia, anaemia. Signs suggesting incurable disease: epigastric mass, hepatomegaly; jaundice, ascites (p604); large left supraclavicular (Virchow’s) node (=Troisier’s sign); acanthosis nigricans (p562). Most patients in the West present with locally advanced (inoperable) or metastatic disease. Spread is local, lymphatic, blood-borne, and transcoelomic, eg to ovaries (Krukenberg tumour). Tests Gastroscopy + multiple ulcer edge biopsies. Aim to biopsy all gastric ul- cers as even malignant ulcers may appear to heal on drug treatment. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can evaluate depth of invasion; CT/MRI helps staging. Staging lapa- roscopy is recommended for locally advanced tumours. Cytology of peritoneal wash- ings can help identify peritoneal metastases. Treatment See p622 for a description of surgical resections. Early gastric cancers may be resectable endoscopically (endoscopic mucosal resection). Partial gastrec- tomy may suffi
