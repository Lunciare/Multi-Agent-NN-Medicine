p604), particularly if the patient is bed-bound with suboptimal nutrition. Temperature The ulcer and surrounding tissues are cold in an ischaemic ulcer. If the skin is warm and well perfused then local factors are more likely. Surface area Draw a map of the area to quantify and time any healing (a wound >4wks old is a chronic ulcer as distinguished from an acute wound). Shape Oval, circular (cigarette burns), serpiginous (Klebsiella granulomatis, p412); unusual morphology can be secondary to mycobacterial infection, eg cutaneous tuberculosis or scrofuloderma (tuberculosis colliquativa cutis, where an infected lymph node ulcerates through to the skin). Edge Shelved/sloping ≈ healing; punched-out ≈ ischaemic or syphilis; rolled/evert- ed ≈ malignant; undermined ≈ TB. Base Any muscle, bone, or tendon destruction (malignancy; pressure sores; is- chaemia)? There may be a grey-yellow slough, beneath which is a pale pink base. Slough is a mixture of fi brin, cell breakdown products, serous exudate, leucocytes, and bacteria—it need not imply infection, and can be part of the normal wound healing process. Granulation tissue is a deep pink gel-like matrix contained within a fi brous collagen network and is evidence of a healing wound. Depth If not uncomfortable for the patient (eg in
