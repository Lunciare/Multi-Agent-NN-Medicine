Postural drainage. Repeated aspiration, antibiotic instillation, or surgical excision may be required. Septicaemia May occur as a result of bacterial spread from the lung parenchyma into the bloodstream. This may cause metastatic infection, eg infective endoc arditis, meningitis. Treat with IV antibiotic according to sensitivities. Pericarditis and myocarditis May also complicate pneumonia.

The lesions are largest in the right low- er zone, where they can be seen to contain air-fl uid levels, typical appearance of infection in a pneumatocele (=air cyst) or cavitating lesion. A moderate right-sided hydropneumothorax can also be seen, suggesting that one of these lesions may have ruptured into the pleural cavity. The patient also has a right subclavian central venous catheter for the
