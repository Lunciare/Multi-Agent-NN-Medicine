BD, 5d course, confi rm technique), nebulized, or IV (res- piratory disease aff ecting nebulizer delivery, ITU). Used if: oseltamivir resistance (eg A(H1N1)), poor clinical response to oseltamivir, concerns re GI absorption of oseltamivir. Retrospective observational data, and animal studies of oseltamivir and zanamivir show no evidence of harm in pregnancy. Supportive treatment for all. Extracorpor- eal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to support gas exchange in severe acute lung injury due to infl uenza. Prevention: • Post-exposure prophylaxis: if high risk (see ‘Treatment’) AND not protected by vac- cination: oseltamivir PO OD (inhaled zanamivir OD if oseltamivir resistance) for 10d. • Annual vaccination in UK: all high risk (see ‘Treatment’), children>2yrs, healthcare workers. See p407. Pandemic infl uenza Seasonal infl uenza is subject to antigenic drift: small genetic changes during repli- cation which can be accounted for in the annual vaccine. Antigenic shift is a major change in infl uenza A resulting in new haemgglutinin (H) and neuraminidase pro- teins (N) for which there is no pre-existing immunity in the population. Any non- human infl uenza viruses which transfer to humans are novel. If they also have, or develop, capacity for rapid human-to-human transmission a pandemic results. Based
