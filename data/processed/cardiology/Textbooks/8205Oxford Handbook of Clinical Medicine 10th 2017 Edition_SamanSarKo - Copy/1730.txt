of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system. Renin is released from the juxtaglomerular apparatus (fi g 7.13, p316) in response to low renal fl ow and raised sympathetic tone, and catalyses the conversion of angiotensinogen (a peptide made by the liver) to angiotensin I. This is then converted by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is located throughout the vascular tree, to angiotensin II. The latter has several important actions including eff erent renal arteriolar constriction (thus perfusion pressure), peripheral vaso constriction, and stimulation of the adrenal cortex to pro- duce aldosterone, which activates the Na+/K+ pump in the distal renal tubule leading to reabsorption of Na+ and water from the urine, in exchange for K+ and H+. Glucose spills over into the urine when the plasma concentration > renal threshold for reab- sorption (≈10mmol/L, but this varies between people, and is  in pregnancy). Control of sodium Control is through the action of aldosterone on the distal con- voluted tubule (DCT) and collecting duct to increase Na+ reabsorption from the urine. The natriuretic peptides ANP, BNP, and CNP (p137) contribute to Na+ homeostasis by reducing Na+ reabsorption from the DCT and inhibiting renin. A high GFR (see later in this topic) results in increased
