down-regulation of fi brinolysis, by thrombin-activated fi brinolysis inhibitor. • Protein C & S defi ciency: These vitamin K-dependent factors act together to cleave and so neutralize factors V & VIII. Heterozygotes defi cient for either protein risk thrombosis. Skin necrosis also occurs (esp. if on warfarin). Homozygous defi - ciency for either protein causes neonatal purpura fulminans—fatal, if untreated. • Antithrombin defi ciency: Antithrombin is a co-factor of heparin, and inhibits thrombin. Less common, aff ects 1:500. Heterozygotes’ thrombotic risk is greater than protein C or S defi ciency by ~4-fold. Homozygosity is incompatible with life. Acquired Causes: • Antiphospholipid syndrome (APL: p554)—serum antiphospho- lipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant ± anticardiolipin antibody) predispose to ve- nous and arterial thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and recurrent fetal loss. In most it is a primary disease, but it is also seen in SLE. • Oral contraceptive pills/HRT (relative risk 2–4; related to both oestrogen and progesterone content/type). • Any cause of thrombocytosis or polycythaemia may also cause thrombosis (p366). Which tests? Ask the lab. Do FBC, fi lm, clotting (PT, thrombin time, APTT, fi brinogen) ± APC resistance test, lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibodies, and assays for antithrombin and proteins C & S defi ciency
