in 1 week. Do thrombophilia tests (p374) before commencing anticoagulant therapy if there are no predisposing factors, in recurrent DVT, or if DVT in unusual site. Look for un- derlying malignancy: Urine dip; FBC, LFT, Ca2+; CXR ± CT abdomen/pelvis (and mam- mography in ) if >40yrs. Prevention •Stop the oral contraceptive pill 4wks pre-op. •Mobilize early. •LMWH eg enoxaparin 20mg/24h SC,  to 40mg for high-risk patients (p375) (caution if eGFR less than 30mL/min/1.73m2). •Graduated compression stockings (‘thromboembolic deter- rent (TED) stockings’; CI: ischaemia) and intermittent pneumatic compression devices  risk of DVT by ~70% in surgical patients.•Fondaparinux (a factor Xa inhibitor)  risk of DVT over LMWH in eg major orthopaedic surgery without  risk of bleeding. Treatment LMWH (eg enoxaparin 1.5mg/kg/24h SC) or fondaparinux. LMWH is superi- or to unfractionated heparin (used in renal failure or if risk of bleeding; dose guided by APTT, p350). Cancer patients should receive LMWH for 6 months (then review). In others, start warfarin simultaneously with LMWH (warfarin is prothrombotic for the fi rst 48h). Stop heparin when INR is 2–3; treat for 3 months in most (longer in some cases—see p351). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACS p190), eg dabigatan, apixaban, rivoraxaban, are
