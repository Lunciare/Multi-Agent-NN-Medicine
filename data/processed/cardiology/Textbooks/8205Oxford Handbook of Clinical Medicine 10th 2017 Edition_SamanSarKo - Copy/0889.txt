-globin genes on chromosome 11, leading to  chain production (+) or its absence (0). Various combinations of mutations are possible (eg 0/0, +/+, or +/0). Tests: FBC, MCV, fi lm, iron, HbA2, HbF, Hb electrophoresis. MRI where myocardial siderosis suspected (from iron overload).  thalassaemia minor or trait (eg /+; heterozygous state): this is a carrier state, and is usually asymptomatic. Mild, well-tolerated anaemia (Hb >90g/L) which may worsen in pregnancy. MCV <75fL, HbA2 >3.5%, slight HbF. Often con- fused with iron-defi ciency anaemia.  thalassaemia intermedia: describes an intermediate state with moderate anae- mia but not requiring transfusions. There may be splenomegaly. There are a vari- ety of causes including mild homozygous  thalassaemia mutations, eg +/+, or co-inheritance of  thalassaemia trait with another haemoglobinopathy, eg HbC thalassaemia (one parent has the HbC trait, and the other has +). Sickle-cell + thalassaemia produces a picture similar to sickle-cell anaemia.  thalassaemia major: denotes signifi cant abnormalities in both -globin genes, and presents in the 1st year, with severe anaemia and failure to thrive. Extra- medullary haematopoiesis (RBCS made outside the marrow) occurs in response to anaemia, causing characteristic head shape, eg skull bossing (fi gs 8.39, 8.40)
