is taller than the S wave is deep), the axis must be be- tween Ω90° and +90°. If lead II (+60°) is mostly positive, the axis must be between Ω30° and +150°. So if both I and II are positive, the axis must be between Ω30° and +90°—the normal range. When II is negative, the axis is likely to be left-deviated (<Ω30°) and when I is negative, the axis is likely to be right-deviated (>+90°). One way of remembering this is: Lovers Leaving—Left axis deviation—the QRS complexes in I and II point away from each other. Lovers Returning—Right axis deviation—the QRS complexes in I and III ± II point towards each other (fi g 3.11). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 9977 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 98 ECG—abnormalities Sinus tachycardia All impulses are initiated in the sinoatrial node (‘sinus rhythm’) hence all QRSS are preceeded by a normal P wave with a normal PR interval. Tachycar- dia means rate >100bpm. See p127. Sinus bradycardia Sinus rhythm at a rate <60bpm. Causes: Physical fi tness, vas- ovagal attacks, sick sinus syndrome, drugs (-blockers, digoxin, amiodarone), hypo- thyroidism, hypothermia, intracranial pressure, cholestasis. See p122. AF (ECG p125) Common causes: IHD, thyrotoxicosis, hypertension, obesity, heart fail- ure, alcohol.
