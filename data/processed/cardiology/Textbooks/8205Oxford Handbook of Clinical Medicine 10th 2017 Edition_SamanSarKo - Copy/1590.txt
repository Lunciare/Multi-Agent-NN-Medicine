(p616). Small bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions should rarely lead to surgery—see BOX, p581. 9 Fermentation of the intestinal contents in established obstruction causes ‘faeculent’ vomiti ng. True ‘fae- cal’ vomiting is found when there is a colonic fi stula with the proximal gut. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 661100 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Paralytic ileus or pseudo-obstruction? 611 Paralytic ileus is adynamic bowel due to the absence of normal peristaltic con- tractions. Contributing factors include abdominal surgery, pancreatitis (or any localized peritonitis), spinal injury, hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, uraemia, perito- neal sepsis and drugs (eg tricyclic antidepressants). Pseudo-obstruction resembles mechanical GI obstruction but with no obstruct- ing lesion. Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is called Ogilvie’s syndrome (p706), and clinical features are similar to that of mechanical obstruction. Predisposing factors: puerperium; pelvic surgery; trauma; cardiorespiratory and neurological disorders. Treatment: Neostigmine or colonoscopic decompression are sometimes useful. In chronic pseudo-obstruction weight loss from malabsorption is a problem. Sigmoid volvulus Sigmoid volvulus occurs when the bowel twists on its mesentery, which can pro- duce severe, rapid, strangulated obstruction (fi g 13.28c). It tends to occur in the elderly, constipated, and comorbid patient, and is managed by insertion of a fl atus tube or sigmoidoscopy. Sigmoid colectomy is sometimes required. If
