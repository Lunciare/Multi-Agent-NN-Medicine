exacerbated by: Pregnancy, K+, infection, over-treatment, change of climate, emotion, exercise, gentamicin, opiates, tetracycline, quinine, -blockers. Diff erentials Polymyositis/other myopathies (p510); SLE; Takayasu’s arteritis (fati- gability of the extremities); botulism (see BOX). Associations Include autoimmune disease (especially rheumatoid arthritis and SLE). If <50yrs, it is commoner in  and associated with thymic hyperplasia; >50, it is commoner in men, and associated with thymic atrophy or thymic tumour. Tests • Antibodies: Anti-AChR antibodies in 90% (70% in MG variant confi ned to ocular muscles). If anti-AChR Ωve look for MuSK antibodies (muscle-specifi c tyrosine kinase; especially in ) .• EMG: Decremental muscle response to repetitive nerve stimulation ± single-fi bre jitter. • Imaging: CT to exclude thymoma (68% 5yr sur- vival). • Other: Ptosis improves by >2mm after ice application to the eyelid for >2min—a neat, non-invasive test (but not diagnostic). The Tensilon® (edrophoni- um) test may not give clear answers and has dangers, so is rarely used. Treatment • Symptom control: Anticholinesterase, eg pyridostigmine (60–120mg PO up to 6≈daily; max 1.2g/d). Cholinergic SE: salivation, lacrimation, sweats, vom- iting, miosis. Other SE: diarrhoea, colic (controllable with propant he line 15mg/8h). • Immunosuppression: Treat relapses with prednisolone—start at 5mg on alter- nate
