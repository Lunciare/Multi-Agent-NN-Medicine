Classifi ed according to protein: light chains in myeloma = AL amyloid; serum amyloid A in chronic infl ammation = AA amyloid; also rare familial types. Diagnosis: Congo red staining on biopsy, SAP scan. Treatment: Underlying condition. New therapies target amyloid production, aggregation, and breakdown. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) Presents with a microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (Hb <100g/L, LDH, haptoglobin, fragments on blood fi lm), platelets and AKI due to thrombosis of the glomerular capillaries (microangiopathy). In children, primarily associated with haemorrhagic colitis due to Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) eg O157:H7. Atypi- cal HUS caused by dysregulation/uncontrolled activation of complement = ~ 5% of HUS. Can be precipitated by pregnancy. Diagnosis: Triad of haemolytic anaemia, platelets, and AKI with haematuria/proteinuria. ?Evidence of STEC. Look for abnor- malities in the complement pathway: levels of C3, C4, factors H and I, complement mutation screen. Treatment: STEC-HUS: supportive. aHUS: plasma infusion/exchange, eculizumab (anti-C5) in England via the national aHUS centre, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) Symptoms overlap with HUS (see previous paragraph). Pentad: microangiopathic haemolytic
