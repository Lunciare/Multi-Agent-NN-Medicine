on MRI/VEP suggestive of primary progres- or continued progression for ≥1yr sive MS A careful history may reveal past episodes, eg brief unexplained visual loss, and detailed examination may show more than 1 lesion. Attacks must last >1h, with >30d between attacks. Six MS eponyms Devic’s syndrome: (=Neuromyelitis optica, NMO.) MS variant with transverse my- elitis, (loss of motor, sensory, autonomic, refl ex, and sphincter function below the level of a lesion), optic atrophy, and anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies (p698). Lhermitte’s sign: Neck fl exion causes ‘electric shocks’ in trunk/limbs. (Also +ve in cervical spondylosis, cord tumours and B12.) Uhthoff’s phenomenon: Worsening of symptoms with heat, eg in bath. Charles Bonnet syndrome: (Rare.) Acuity/temporary blindness ± complex visual hallucinations of faces, as well as animals, plants, and trees. Pulfrich effect: Unequal eye latencies, causing disorie ntation in traffi c as straight trajectories seem curved and distances are misjudged on looking sideways.
