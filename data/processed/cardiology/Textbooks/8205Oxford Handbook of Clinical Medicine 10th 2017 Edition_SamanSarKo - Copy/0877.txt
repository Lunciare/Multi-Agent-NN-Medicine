accord- ing to optimal binding temperature to RBCs: Warm AIHA: IgG-mediated, bind at body T° 37°C. : Steroids/immunosuppressants (± splenectomy). Cold AIHA: IgM-mediated, bind at T° (<4°C), activating cell-surface complement. Causes a chronic anaemia made worse by cold, often with Raynaud’s or acrocyanosis. : keep warm. Chloram bucil may help. Causes: most are idiopathic; 2° causes of warm AIHA include lymphop roliferative disease (CLL, lymphoma), drugs, autoim- mune disease, eg SLE. Cold AIHA may follow infection (mycoplasma; EBV). • Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria: seen with viruses/syphilis. It is caused by Donath–Landsteiner antibodies sticking to RBCS in the cold, causing self-limit- ing complement-mediated haemolysis on rewarming. • Isoimmune: acute transfusion reaction (p349); haemolysis of the newborn. 2 Direct antiglobulin/Coombs Ωve AIHA: (2% of all AIHA.) Autoimmune hepatitis; hepatitis B & C; post fl u and other vaccinations; drugs (piperacillin, rituximab). 3 Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (MAHA): Mechanical damage to RBCS in circula- tion, causing intravascular haemolysis and schistocytes (fi gs 8.30, 8.31). Causes include haemolytic–uraemic syndrome (HUS), TTP (p315), DIC, pre-eclampsia, and eclampsia. Prosthetic heart valves can also cause mechanical damage. 4 Infection: Malaria (p416): RBC lysis and ‘blackwater fever’ (haemoglobinuria). All infections can exacerbate haemolysis. 5 Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria: Rare acquired stem
