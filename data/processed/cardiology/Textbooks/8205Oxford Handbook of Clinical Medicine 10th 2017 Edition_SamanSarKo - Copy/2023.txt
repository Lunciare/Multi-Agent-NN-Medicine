There are >150 000 cases of sepsis in the UK each year result- ing in >44 000 deaths, and much morbidity. Sepsis Life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Septic shock Sepsis in combination with: • EITHER lactate >2mmol/L despite adequate fl uid resuscitation • OR the patient is requiring vasopressors to maintain MAP ≥65mmHg.  Sepsis recognition Many sepsis-related deaths could be prevented with earlier treatment. Often, the key failure in sepsis management is not recognizing sepsis in time. Early warning scores (p892, fi g A1) help identify
