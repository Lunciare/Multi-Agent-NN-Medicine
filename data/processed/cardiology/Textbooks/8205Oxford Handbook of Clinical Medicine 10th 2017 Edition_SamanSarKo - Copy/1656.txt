See p641. Clinical features • Acute upper tract obstruction: Loin pain radiating to the groin. There may be superimposed infection ± loin tenderness, or an enlarged kidney. • Chronic upper tract obstruction: Flank pain, renal failure, superimposed infection. Polyuria may occur due to impaired urinary concentration. • Acute lower tract obstruction: Acute urinary retention typically presents with severe suprapubic pain ± acute confusion (elderly); often acute on chronic (hence preceded by chronic symptoms , see next bullet point). Clinically: distended, palpable bladder containing ~600mL, dull to percussion. Causes include prostatic obstruction (usual cause in older ), urethral strictures, anticholinergics, blood clots eg from bladder lesion (‘clot retention’), alcohol, constipation, post-op (pain/infl ammation/ anaesthetics), infection (p296), neurological (cauda equina syndrome, see p466). • Chronic lower tract obstruction: Symptoms: urinary frequency, hesitancy, poor stream, terminal dribbling, overfl ow incontinence. Signs: distended, palpable blad- der (capacity may be >1.5L) ± large prostate on PR. Complications: UTI, urinary retention, renal failure (eg bilateral obstructive uropathy—see BOX ‘Obstructive uropathy’). Causes include prostatic enlargement (common); pelvic malignancy; rectal surgery; DM; CNS disease, eg transverse myelitis/MS; zoster (S2–S4). Tests Blood: U&E, creatinine, FBC, and prostate-specifi c antigen (PSA, p530).12 Urine: Dipstick and MC&S. Ultrasound (p744) is the
