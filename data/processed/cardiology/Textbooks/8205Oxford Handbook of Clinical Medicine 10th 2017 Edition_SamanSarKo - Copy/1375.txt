This includes the course of the disease, the eff ectiveness of treatment, and the detec- tion of cancer recurrence. The following markers may be useful: • FP and hCG in testicular/germ cell tumours. • CEA in colorectal cancer. • CA 125 in ovarian cancer. • A cautious interpretation of PSA within the limits of its specifi city and sensitivity. Screening for cancer The UK has several well-established cancer screening programmes. Women are invited for mammography every 3yrs (50–70yrs) and off ered cervical smear tests every 3–5yrs (25–64yrs). Men and women aged 60–74yrs are off ered faecal occult blood testing every 2yrs. Screening tests aim to pick out those who need further investigation to rule out or diagnose a cancer, in the hope that earlier diagnosis and treatment result in better outcomes. All screening tests come with risk: anxiety, harm/discomfort from the test, cost, false positives resulting in further invasive tests, false nega- tives conferring inappropriate reassurance when symptoms arise. When consider- ing screening an asymptomatic population the potential risks and benefi ts need to
