On examination, there may be no signs, or hypertension ± signs of heart failure/cardiomyopathy (± para- doxical shock, similar to Takotsubo’s6), episodic thyroid swelling, glycosuria during attacks, or terminal haematuria from a bladder phaeochromocytoma. 6 Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (=stress- or catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy/broken heart syn- drome) may cause sudden chest pain mimicking MI, with ST segments, and its signature apical ballooning on echo (also ejection fraction) occurring during catecholamine surges. It is a cause of MI in the presence of normal arteries. The stress may be medical (SAH, p478) or psychological. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 222299 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE 230 Hirsutism, virilism, gynaecomastia, and impotence Hirsutism is common (10% of women) and usually benign. It implies male pattern hair growth in women. Causes are familial, idiopathic, or are due to androgen secre- tion by the ovary (eg polycystic ovarian syndrome, ovarian cancer, OHCS p281), the adrenal gland (eg late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia, OHCS p251, Cushing’s syndrome, adrenal cancer), or drugs (eg steroids). Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) causes secondary oligo- or amenorrhoea, infertility, obesity, acne, and hirsutism (OHCS p252). Ultrasound: bilateral polycystic ovaries. Blood tests: testosterone (if ≥6nmol/L, look for an androgen-producing adrenal or
