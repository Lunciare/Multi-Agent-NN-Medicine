there calcifi ed valves? Diaphragm The right side is often slightly higher (due to the liver). Causes of raised hemidiaphragm: Trouble above the diaphragm—lung volume loss or infl ammation. Trouble with the diaphragm—stroke; phrenic nerve palsy (causes, p504; any medias- tinal mass?). Trouble below the diaphragm—hepatomegaly; subphrenic abscess. NB: subpulmonic eff usion (eff usions having a similar contour to the diaphragm without a characteristic meniscus) and diaphragm rupture give apparent elevation. NB: bilat- eral palsies (polio, muscular dystrophy) cause hypoxia. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 772222 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR 723 Fig 16.2 Lower lobe collapse (right lung). The right heart border is obscured. Volume loss in the right lower zone results in a hyper-expanded right upper lobe that is more radiolucent than the left upper lobe. Courtesy of Dr Edmund Godfrey.

It may therefore be better
