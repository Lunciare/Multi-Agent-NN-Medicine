Handbook of Clinical medicine

Character depends on underlying cause. Examples: irritation of the mucosa (acute gastritis), smooth muscle spasm (acute enterocolitis), capsular stretching (liver con- gestion in CCF), peritoneal infl ammation (acute appendicitis), and direct splanchnic nerve stimulation (retrop eritoneal extension of tumour). The character (constant or colicky, sharp or dull), duration, and frequency depend on the mechanism of production. The location and distribution of referred pain depend on the anatomi- cal site. Time of occurrence and aggravating or relieving factors such as meals, defecation, and sleep also have special signifi cance related to the underlying disease process. The site of the pain may provide a clue: • Epigastric: Pancreatitis, gastritis/duodenitis, peptic ulcer, gallbladder disease, aortic aneurysm. • Left upper quadrant: Peptic ulcer, gastric or colonic (splenic fl exure) cancer, splenic rupture, subphrenic or perinephric abscess, renal (colic, pyelonephritis). • Right upper quadrant: Cholecystitis, biliary colic, hepatitis, peptic ulcer, colonic cancer (hepatic fl exure), renal (colic, pyelonephritis), subphrenic/perinephric ab- scess. • Loin: (lateral ⅓ of back between thorax and pelvis—merges with the fl ank, p565) Renal colic, pyelonephritis, renal tumour, perinephric abscess, pain referred from vertebral column. Causes of fl ank pain are similar (see index for fuller list). • Left iliac fossa: Diverticulitis,
