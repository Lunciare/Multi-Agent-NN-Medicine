Rivastigmine may help all three. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors: Donepezil, rivastigmine, and galan- tamine are all mod estly eff ective in treating AD and are recommended by NICE.6 There is also some evidence for their effi cacy in the dementia of Parkinson’s disease, and rivastigmine may improve behavioural symptoms in Lewy body dementia—though none should be used in mild disease and they should be dis- continued if there is no worthwile eff ect on symptoms.
