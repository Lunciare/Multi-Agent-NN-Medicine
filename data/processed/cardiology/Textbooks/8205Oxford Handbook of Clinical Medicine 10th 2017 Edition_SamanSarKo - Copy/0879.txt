transfuse if severe. • Pyruvate kinase defi ciency (AUTOSOMAL RECESSIVE): ATP production causes RBC survival. Homozygotes have neonatal jaundice; later, haemolysis with splenomeg- aly ± jaundice. Tests: enzyme assay. : often not needed; splenectomy may help. 2 Membrane defects: All are Coombs Ωve; all need folate; splenectomy helps some. • Hereditary spherocytosis (AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT): prevalence: 1:3000. Less de- formable spherical RBCS, so trapped in spleen  extravascular haemolysis. Signs: Splenomegaly, jaundice. Tests: Mild if Hb >110g/L and reticulocytes <6%; fi lm: fi g 8.35.  Bilirubin (gallstones). • Hereditary elliptocytosis (AUTOSOMAL DOMINANT): fi lm: fi g 8.36. Mostly asympto- matic (somewhat protects from malaria). 10% display a more severe phenotype (± death in utero). • Hereditary ovalocytosis and stomatocytosis are rarer. Refer to a haematologist. 3 Haemoglobinopathy: • Sickle-cell disease (p340). • Thalassaemia (p342). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 333388 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 339 Fig 8.29 Autoimmune haemolytic anaem ia: Fig 8.30 Microangiopathic anaemia, eg from antibody-coated red cells underg oing phagocy- DIC: num erous cell fragments (schisto cytes) are tosis by monocytes. present. © Prof C Lawrence.
