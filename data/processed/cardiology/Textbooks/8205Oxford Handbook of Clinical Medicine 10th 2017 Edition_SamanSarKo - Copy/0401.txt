Surgery if: Heart failure, valvular ob- struction; repeated emboli; fungal IE; persistent bacteraemia; myocardial abscess; unstable infected prosthetic valve. 64 Prognosis 50% require surgery. 20% inhospital mortality (Staphs 30%; bowel bac- teria 14%; Streps 6%). 15% recurrence at 2yrs. Prevention Antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended for those at risk of IE undergoing invasive procedures. However, if they are given antibiotics for other reasons during a procedure, the antibiotic should cover the common IE organisms.
