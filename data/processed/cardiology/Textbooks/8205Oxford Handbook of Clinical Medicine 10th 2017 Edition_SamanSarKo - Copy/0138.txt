are heard best in the pulmonary area. Additional sounds 3rd heart sound (S3) may occur just after S2. It is low pitched and best heard with the bell of the stethoscope. S3 is pathological over the age of 30yrs. A loud S3 occurs in a dilated left ventricle with rapid ventricular fi lling (mitral regurgitation, VSD) or poor LV function (post MI, dilated cardiomyopathy). In constrictive pericarditis or restrictive cardiomyopathy it occurs early and is more high pitched (‘pericardial knock’). 4th heart sound (S4) occurs just before S1. Always abnormal, it represents atrial contraction against a ventricle made stiff by any cause, eg aortic stenosis or hyper- tensive heart disease. Triple and gallop rhythms A 3rd or 4th heart sound occurring with a sinus tachycar- dia may give the impression of galloping hooves. An S3 gallop has the same rhythm as ‘Ken-tucky’, whereas an S4 gallop has the same rhythm as ‘Tenne-ssee’. When S3 and S4 occur in a tachycardia, eg with pulmonary embolism, they may summate and appear as a single sound, a summation gallop. An ejection systolic click is heard early in systole with bicuspid aortic valves, and if BP. The right heart equivalent lesions may also cause
