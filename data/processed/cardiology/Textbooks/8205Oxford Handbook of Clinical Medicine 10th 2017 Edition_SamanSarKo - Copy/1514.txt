Allay anxiety, give parenteral pain control, set up an IVI, and return patient to theatre. Incisional hernia is a common late problem (20%), repairable by mesh insertion (if necessary). Biliary surgery Early: Iatrogenic bile duct injury, cholangitis, bile leakage, bleeding into the biliary tree (haemobilia—may lead to melaena or haematemesis); pancreatitis. Retained stones may be removed by ERCP (p742); if this is not available a ‘T-tube’ left in the bile duct at the time of closure allows free drainage to the exterior; unrelieved distal obstruction of the bile duct may result in fi stula formation and chronic leakage of bile. If jaundiced, maintain a good urine output, monitor coagulation, and consider antibiotics. Late: Bile duct stricture; post-cholecystectomy syndrome (symptoms aris- ing from alterations in bile fl ow due to loss of the reservoir function of the gallbladder). Thyroid surgery Early: Recurrent (± superior) laryngeal nerve palsy (hoarseness) can occur permanently in 0 . 5% and transiently in 1 . 5%—warn the patient that their voice will be different for a few days post-op because of intubation and local oedema (NB: pre-operative fi breoptic laryngoscopy should be performed to exclude pre-exist- ing vocal cord dysfunction); thyroid storm (symptoms of severe hypert
