cell arteritis, Takayasu’s arteritis (see p712). • Medium Polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki disease (OHCS p646). • Small • ANCA-associated: microscopic polyangiitis; granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s granulomatosis); and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg Strauss syndrome; 40–60% are ANCA positive). • Immune complex vasculitis: Goodpas- ture’s disease; cryoglobulinaemic vasculitis; IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schonlein purpura). • Variable vessel vasculitis Behçet’s (p694) and Cogan’s syndrome. Symptoms Diff erent vasculitides preferentially aff ect diff erent organs, causing dif- ferent patterns of symptoms (see BOX ‘Features of vasculitis’), Often only overwhelm- ing fatigue with ESR/CRP. Consider vasculitis in any unidentifi ed multisystem disorder. If presentation does not fi t clinically or serologically into a specifi c cat- egory consider malignancy-associated vasculitis. A severe vasculitis fl are is a medi- cal emergency. If suspected, seek urgent help, as organ damage may occur rapidly (eg critical renal failure <24h). Tests ESR/CRP. ANCA may be +ve. Creatinine if renal failure. Urine: proteinuria, haematuria, casts on microscopy. Angiography ± biopsy may be diagnostic. Management Large-vessel: steroids in most cases, may add ster- oid-sparing agents later. Medium/small: immunosuppression (steroids, ± another agent, eg cyclophosphamide if severe, or methotrexate/azathioprine depending on features). Giant cell arteritis (GCA) = temporal arteritis Common in the elderly—consider Takayasu’s
