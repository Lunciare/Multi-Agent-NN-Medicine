via lymph, or haemat ogenous (bone, liver, lung). 25% have metastases at presentation. Tests: BP: from renin secretion. Blood: FBC (polycythaemia from erythropoietin secretion); ESR; U&E, ALP (bony mets?). Urine: RBCS; cytology. Imaging: US (p744); CT/MRI; CXR (‘cannon ball’ metastases). : Radical nephrectomy (nephron-sparing surgery is as good for T1 tumours + preserves renal function). Cryotherapy and radiofrequency ablation is an option for patients unfi t or unwilling to undergo surgery. RCC is generally radio- & chemoresistant. In those with unresectable or metastatic disease, options include: high-dose IL-2 and other T-cell activation therapies; anti-angiogenesis agents (eg pazopanib, sunitinib, axitinib, or bevacizumab); mTOR inhibitors, eg temsir olimus. The Mayo prognostic risk score (SSIGN) was developed to predict survival and uses information on tumour stage, size, grade, and necrosis. Prognosis: 10yr survival ranges from 96.5% (scores 0–1) to 19.2% (scores ≥ 10). Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) may arise in the bladder (50%), ureter, or renal pelvis. Epidemiology: Age >40yrs; :≈4:1. Risk factors: p646. Presentation: Pain- less haematuria; frequency; urgency; dysuria; urinary tract obstruction. Diagnosis: Urine cytology; IVU; cystoscopy + biopsy; CT/MRI. : See ‘Bladder tumours’, p646. Prognosis: Varies with clinical stage/histological grade: 10–80% 5yr survival. Wilms’ tumour (nephroblastoma) is a childhood tumour
