negative intrathoracic pressures are needed to generate air entry). Stridor? Respiratory rate, breathing pattern (see BOX ‘Breathing patterns’). Look for chest wall and spine deformities (see p55). Inspect for scars of past surgery, chest drains, or radiotherapy (skin thickening, tattoos for radiotherapy). Chest wall move- ment: symmetrical? (if not, pathology on restricted side). Paradoxical respiration? (abdomen sucked in with inspiration; seen in diaphragmatic paralysis, see p502). Hands Clubbing, peripheral cyanosis, tar stains, fi ne tremor (-agonist use), wast- ing of in trinsic muscles (T1 lesions, eg Pancoast’s tumour, p708). Tender wrists (hy- pertrophic pulmonary osteo arthropathy—cancer). Aster ixis (CO2 retention). Pulse: paradoxical (respiratory distress), bounding (CO2 retention). Face Ptosis and constricted pupil (Horner’s syndrome, eg Pancoast’s tumour, p708)? Bluish tongue and lips (central cyanosis, p34)? Conjunctival pallor (anaemia)? Neck Trachea: Central or displaced? (towards collapse or away from large pleural eff usion/tension pneumothorax; slight deviation to right is normal). Cricosternal dis- tance <3cm is hyperexpansion. Tracheal tug: descent of trachea with inspiration (se- vere airfl ow limitation). Lymphadenopathy: TB/Ca? JVP:  in cor pulmonale. Palpation Apex beat: Impalpable? (COPD/pleural eff usion/dextrocardia?) Ex- pansion: <5cm on deep inspiration is abnormal. Symmetry? Tactile vocal fremitus:  implies consolidation. Percussion Dull percussion note:
