obstruction. Diagnosis: Urine cytology; IVU; cystoscopy + biopsy; CT/MRI. : See ‘Bladder tumours’, p646. Prognosis: Varies with clinical stage/histological grade: 10–80% 5yr survival. Wilms’ tumour (nephroblastoma) is a childhood tumour of primitive renal tubules and mesenchymal cells. Prevalence: 1:100 000—the chief abdominal malignancy in children. It presents with an abdominal mass and haematuria. : OHCS p133. Prostate cancer The commonest male malignancy. Incidence: with age: 80% in men >80yrs (autopsy studies). Associations: +ve family history (x2–3 risk, p521), testost erone. Most are adenocarcinomas arising in peripheral prostate. Spread may be local (seminal vesicles, bladder, rectum) via lymph, or haemat ogenously (sclerotic bony lesions). Symptoms: Asymptomatic or nocturia, hesitancy, poor stream, terminal dribbling, or obstruction. Weight ± bone pain suggests mets. DRE exam of prostate: may show hard, irregular prostate. Diagnosis: PSA (normal in 30% of small cancers); transrectal US & biopsy; bone scan; CT/MRI. Staging: MRI. Treatment: Disease confi ned to prostate: options depend on prognosis (see BOX ‘Prognostic factors’), patient prefer- ence, and comorbidities. •Radical prostatectomy if <70yrs gives excellent disease-free survival (laparoscopic surgery is as good). The role of adjuvant hormonal therapy is being explored. •Radical radiotherapy (± neoadjuvant & adjuvant hormonal therapy) is an alternative curative option
