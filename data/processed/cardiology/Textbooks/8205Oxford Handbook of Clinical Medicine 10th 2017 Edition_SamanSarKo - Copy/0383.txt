abnormality (prevalence: ~5%). Occurs alone or with: ASD, patent ductus arteriosus, cardiomyopathy, Turner’s syn- drome, Marfan’s syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, pseudoxanthoma elasticum, WPW (p133). Symptoms: Usually asymptomatic. May develop atypical chest pain, palpitations, and autonomic dysfunction symptoms. Signs: Mid-systolic click and/ or a late systolic murmur. Complications: MR, cerebral emboli, arrhythmias, sud- den death. Tests: Echo is diagnostic. ECG may show inferior T-wave inversion. : -blockers may help palpit ations and chest pain. Surgery if severe MR. Mitral stenosis Causes: Rheumatic fever, congenital, mucopolysaccharidoses, endo cardial fi broelastosis, malignant carcinoid (p271; rare), prosthetic valve. Presentation: Normal mitral valve orifi ce area is ~4–6cm2. Symptoms usually be- gin when the orifi ce becomes <2cm2. Pulmonary hypertension causes dyspnoea, haemoptysis, chronic bronchitis-like picture; pressure from large left atrium on local structures causes hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve), dysphagia (oesophagus), bronchial obstruction; also fatigue, palpitations, chest pain, systemic emboli, infec- tive endocarditis (rare). Signs: Malar fl ush on cheeks (due to cardiac output); low-volume pulse; AF common (due to enlarged LA); tapping, non-displaced, apex beat (palpable S1); RV heave. On auscultation: loud S1; opening snap (pliable valve); rumbling mid-diastolic murmur (heard best in expiration, with patient on left side). Graham Steell murmur (p46) may occur.
