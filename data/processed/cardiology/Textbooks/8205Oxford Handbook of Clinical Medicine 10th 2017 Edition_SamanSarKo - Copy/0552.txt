neu- tropenia (in Graves’), ESR, Ca2+, LFT. Also: Check thyroid autoantibodies. Isotope scan if the cause is unclear, to detect nodular disease or subacute thyroiditis. If ophthal- mopathy, test visual fi elds, acuity, and eye movem ents (see BOX ‘Thyroid eye disease’). Causes Graves’ disease: Prevalence: 0.5% (⅔ of cases of hyperthyroidism). :≈9:1. Typical age: 40–60yrs (younger if maternal family history). Cause: circulating IgG autoan- tibodies binding to and activating G-protein-coupled thyrotropin receptors, which cause smooth thyroid enlargement and hormone production (esp. T3), and react with orbital autoantigens. Triggers: stress; infection; childbirth. Patients are often hyperthyroid but may be, or become, hypo- or euthyroid. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases: vitiligo, type 1 DM, Addison’s (table 5.3). Toxic multinodular goitre: Seen in the elderly and in iodine-defi cient areas. There are nodules that secrete thyroid hormones. Surgery is indicated for compressive symptoms from the enlarged thyroid (dysphagia or dyspnoea). Toxic adenoma: There is a solitary nodule producing T3 and T4. On isotope scan, the nodule is ‘hot’ (p216), and the rest of the gland is suppressed. Ectopic thyroid tissue: Metastatic follicular thyroid cancer, or struma ovarii: ovar- ian teratoma with thyroid tissue. Exogenous: Iodine excess, eg food contamination, contr
