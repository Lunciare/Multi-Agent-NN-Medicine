with cancer is formally reviewed by a multidis- ciplinary team (MDT). The aim of the MDT is to coordinate high-quality diagnosis, treatment, and care. The MDT should make a recommendation on the best initial treatment for cancer. Note: an MDT can only ‘recommend’; the decision must be made in consultation with the patient. The MDT is made up of healthcare profes- sionals with expertise in treating and supporting patients with cancer. Members should include, but are not limited to: • lead clinician and lead nurse specialist • radiologists (see BOX ‘Interventional oncology’, p527) • histopathologists • expert surgeons, eg upper GI, colorectal, breast, plastics • oncologists (medical and clinical) • palliative care physicians • nominated member to support ongoing clinical trials • patient representative • administrative support. Cancer staging Staging systems are used to describe the extent of a cancer. This is vital to deter- mine the most appropriate treatment, to assess prognosis, and to identify relevant clinical trials. A cancer is always referred to by the stage given at diagnosis. The TNM system is most widely used and is based on the extent of tumour (T), spread to lymph nodes (N), and the presence of metastases (M) (table 11.1).
