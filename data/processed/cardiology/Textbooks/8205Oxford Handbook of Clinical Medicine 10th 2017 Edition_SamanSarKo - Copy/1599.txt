mesh reinforces the posterior wall. Recurrence rate is less than with other methods (eg <2% vs 10%). (CI: strangulated hernias, con- tamination with pus/bowel contents.) Local anaesthetic techniques and day-case ‘ambulatory’ surgery may halve the price of surgery. This is important because this is one of the most common operations (>100 000 per year in the UK). Laparoscopic repair gives similar recurrence rates. Methods include transabdominal pre-perito- neal (TAPP) in which the peritoneum is entered and the hernia repaired, and totally extraperitoneal (TEP), which decreases the risk of visceral injury. For benefi ts of lapa- roscopic surgery see p592. Return to work: Will depend upon surgical approach and patient—discuss this pre- operatively. Rest for 4wks and convalescence over 8wks with open approaches, but laparoscopic repairs may allow return to manual work (and driving) after ≤2wks if all is well. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 661144 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Anterior superior Inferior epigastric 615 iliac spine vessels Deep inguinal ring Indirect inguinal hernia Direct inguinal hernia Deep inguinal node Course of spermatic cord Superficial ring Pubic tubercle Nerve Femoral Artery Femoral hernia Vein Cloquet’s node Fig 13.33 Anatomy of the inguinal canal.
