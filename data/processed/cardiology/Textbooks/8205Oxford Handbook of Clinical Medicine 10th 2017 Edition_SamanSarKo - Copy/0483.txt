It is defi ned as a PaO2 <8kPa and subdivided into two types according to PaCO2 level. Type I respiratory failure Defi ned as hypoxia (PaO2 <8kPa) with a normal or low PaCO2. It is caused primarily by ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, hypoventila- tion, abnormal diff usion, right to left cardiac shunts. Examples of V/Q mismatch: • Pneumonia. • Pulmonary oedema. • PE. • Asthma. • Emphysema. • Pulmonary fi brosis. • ARDS (p186). Type II respiratory failure Defi ned as hypoxia (PaO2 <8kPa) with hypercapnia (PaCO2 >6.0kPa). This is caused by alveolar hypoventilation, with or without V/Q mis- match. Causes include: • Pulmonary disease: Asthma, COPD, pneumonia, end-stage pulmonary fi brosis, ob- structive sleep apnoea (OSA, p194). • Reduced respiratory drive: Sedative drugs, CNS tumour or trauma. • Neuromuscular disease: Cervical cord lesion, diaphragmatic paralysis, poliomyeli- tis, myasthenia gravis, Guillain–Barré syndrome. • Thoracic wall disease: Flail chest, kyphoscoliosis.
