ts, except perhaps in •young patients (more years at risk, and surgery is twice as hazardous if >45yrs old) who have •aneurysms >7mm in diameter, especially if located at the •junction of the inter- nal carotid and the posterior communicating cerebral artery, or at the •rostral basilar artery bifurcation, and especially if there is •uncontrolled hypertension or a •past history of bleeds. Data from the 2003 International Study of Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms (ISUIA) show that relative risk of rupture for an aneurysm 7–12mm across is 3.3 compared with aneurysms <7mm across; if the diameter is >12mm, the relative risk is 17.
