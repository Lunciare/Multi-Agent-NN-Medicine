the patient is too ill or declines valve surgery). • Congenital heart disease: diagnostic (assessment of severity of lesions by meas- uring pressures and saturations); therapeutic (balloon dilatation or septostomy). • Other: cardiomyopathy; pericardial disease; endomyocardial biopsy. Pre-procedure checks • Brief history/examination; NB: peripheral pulses, bruits, aneurysms. • Investigations: FBC, U&E, LFT, clotting screen, CXR, ECG. • Consent for procedure, including possible extra procedures, eg consent for angio- plasty if planning to do angiography as you may fi nd a lesion that needs stenting. Explain reason for procedure and possible complications. • IV access, ideally in the left hand. • Patient should be nil by mouth (NBM) from 6h before the procedure. • Patients should take all their morning drugs (and pre-medication if needed)—but withhold oral hypoglycaemics. Post-procedure checks • Pulse, BP, arterial puncture site (for bruising or swelling), foot pulses. • Investigations: FBC and clotting (if suspected blood loss), ECG. Complications • Haemorrhage: apply fi rm pressure over puncture site. If you suspect a false aneu- rysm, ultrasound the swelling and consider surgical repair. Haematomas are high risk for infections. • Contrast reaction: this is usually mild with modern contrast agents. • Loss of peripheral pulse: may be due
