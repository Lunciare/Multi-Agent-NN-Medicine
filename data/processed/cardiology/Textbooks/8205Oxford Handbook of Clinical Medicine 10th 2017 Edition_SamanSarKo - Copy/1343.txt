Without an understanding of your patient’s starting point, you may fail to be eff ective in your guidance and support. Tips for the discussion of a cancer diagnosis 1 Set the environment up carefully. Choose a quiet place where you will not be disturbed. Make sure family or friends are present according to your patient’s wishes. Anticipate likely questions and be sure of your facts. 2 Find out what the patient already knows and believes (often a great deal). ‘What are you worried about today?’ 3 Give some warning: ‘There is some bad news for us to address’. 4 Ascertain how much the person wants to know. ‘Are you someone who likes to know all the details about your condition?’ Although information is a prior- ity for the majority of cancer patients, this may change with the individual, and the course of the disease. ‘Monitors’ will seek information, ‘blunters’ will distract themselves. 5 Share information about diagnosis and treatments. Specifi cally list support- ing people (oncology multidisciplinary team) and institutions (hospices).
