spread. Suspect an invasive fungal infection in: 1 Any patient with risk factors (see table 9.15). 2 Any systemically unwell patient who fails to respond to antibiotic therapy. 3 Any persistently febrile patient with no microbiological evidence of infection. Table 9.15 Risk factors associated with invasive fungal infection. Risk factor Includes Infection HIV, CMV, TB, colonization/inadequate treatment of superfi cial fungal disease, broad-spectrum antibiotics, prior fungal infection. Malignancy Neutropenia, mucositis, haematological malignancy. Critical illness Mortality prediction score (eg APACHE), prolonged ITU admis- sion, prolonged ventilation, severe trauma/pancreatitis. Catheter Central venous catheter, urinary catheter, dialysis access, TPN. Transplantation Immunosuppressant medication, recent rejection, graft-versus- host disease. Genetic Hereditary chronic granulomatous disease, abnormalities in tumour necrosis factor/interleukins/cytokines. Surgical Major surgery, GI perforation, anastomotic leak, length of transplant operation, delayed closure. Other comorbidity Any disease managed with immunosuppressive therapy, burns.

Investigations: • Blood culture: three samples, diff erent sites, same sitting, aim total 40–60mL blood. • Microscopy+immunohistochemistry/fl uorescence depending on site/risk. • Other: antigen/antibody testing for general (eg mannan, galactomannan) and specifi c (eg cryptococcal) fungi; fungal metabolites; PCR: for typing/confi rmation. Seek expert advice on empirical
