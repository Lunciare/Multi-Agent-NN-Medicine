packs and lidocaine gel may also help. May require aspira- tion/dorsal slit/circumcision. Prostatitis May be acute or chronic. Usually those >35yrs. Acute prostatitis is caused mostly by S. faecalis and E. coli, also Chlamydia (and previously TB). Features: UTIs, reten- tion, pain, haematospermia, swollen/boggy prostate on DRE. : Analgesia; levofl oxa- cin 500mg/24h PO for 28d. Chronic prostatitis may be bacterial or non-bacterial. Symptoms as for acute prostatitis, but present for >3 months. Non-bacterial chronic prostatitis does not respond to antibiotics. Anti-infl ammatory drugs, –blockers, and prostatic massage all have a place. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 664455 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 646 Bladder tumours >90% are transitional cell carcinomas (TCCS) in the UK. Adenocarcin omas and squa- mous cell carcinomas are rare in the West (the latter may follow schistosomiasis). UK incidence ≈ 1:6000/yr. :≈5:2. Histology is important for prognosis: Grade 1— diff erentiated; Grade 2—intermediate; Grade 3—poorly diff ere ntiated. 80% are con- fi ned to bladder mucosa, and only ~20% penetrate muscle (increasing mortality to 50% at 5yrs). Presentation Painless haematuria; recurrent UTIs; voiding irritability. Associations Smoking; aromatic amines (rubber industry); chronic cystitis; schisto- somiasis (risk of squamous cell carcinoma); pelvic irradiation. Tests • Cystoscopy with biopsy is diagnostic. • Urine: microscopy/cytology
