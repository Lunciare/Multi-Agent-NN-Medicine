Handbook of Clinical medicine

The main complication of the procedure is severe hypovolaemia secondary to reaccumulation of the ascites, so intravascular replenishment with a plasma expander is required. For smaller vol- umes, eg less than 5L, 500mL of 5% human albumin or Gelofusine® would be suf- fi cient. For volumes over 5L, reasonable replacement would be 100mL 20% human albumin IV for each 1–3 litres of ascites drained (check your local policy). You may need to call the haematology lab to request this in advance. Procedure Requires sterile technique. • Ensure you have good IV access—eg 18G cannula in the antecubital fossa. • Explain the procedure including the risks of infection, bleeding, hyponatraemia, renal impairment, and damage to surrounding structures (such as liver, spleen, and bowel), and obtain consent from the patient. Serious complications occur in less than 1 in 1000 patients. Ask the patient to empty their bladder. • Examine the abdomen carefully, evaluating the ascites and checking for orga- nomegaly. Mark where you are going to enter. If in doubt, ask the radiology de- partment to ultrasound the abdomen and mark a spot for drainage. Approach from the left side unless previous local surgery/stoma prevents this—call a senior for support and advice
