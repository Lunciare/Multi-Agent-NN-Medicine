if possible. Treatment Aim to correct (or prevent) tumour compression by excising the lesion, and to reduce GH and IGF-I levels to at least a ‘safe’ GH level of <2mcg/L (<6mIU/L). A 3-part strategy: 1 Trans- sphenoidal surgery is often 1st line. 2 If surgery fails to correct GH/IGF-I hypersecretion, try somatostatin analogues (SSA) and/or radiotherapy, SSA being generally preferred. Example: octreotide (Sandostatin LAR®, given monthly IM), or lanreotide (Somatuline LA®). SE: pain at the injection site; gastrointestinal: abdominal cramps, fl atulence, loose stools, gallstones; impaired glucose tolerance. 3 The GH antagonist pegvisomant (recombinant GH ana- logue) is used if resistant or intolerant to SSA. It suppr esses IGF-1 to normal in 90%, but GH levels may rise; rarely tumour size in- creases, so monitor closely. Radiotherapy: If unsuited to surg ery or as adjuvant; may take years to work. Follow-up: Yearly GH, IGF- 1 ± OGTT; visual fi elds; vascular assess ment. BMI; photos (fi g 5.29). Prognosis May return to normal (any excess mortality is mostly vascular). 16% get diabetes with SSAs vs ~13% after surgery. Fig 5.28 Acromegaly. Courtesy of Omar Rio. My life with acromegaly.
