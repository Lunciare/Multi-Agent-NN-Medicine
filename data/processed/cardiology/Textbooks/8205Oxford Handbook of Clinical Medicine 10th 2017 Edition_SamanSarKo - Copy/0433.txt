investiga- tions: FBC, coagulation, CXR, CT, spirometry, pulse oximetry, and ABG (if indicated). Complications: Hypoxia, bleeding, pneumo thorax (fi g 16.43, p749). Diagnostic sensi- tivity for cancer 50–90%, depends on tumour location; gene profi ling of cell sample may improve this. 2 May also be used to deliver an ultrasound probe (endobronchial ultrasound), and treatments—eg stents, or cryotherapy. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed at the time of bronchoscopy by in- stilling and aspirating a known volume of warmed, buff ered 0.9% saline into the distal airway. Diagnostic indications: Suspected malignancy, pneumonia, in the im- munosuppressed (especially HIV), bronchiectasis, suspected TB (if sputum negative), interstitial lung diseases (eg sarcoidosis, extrinsic allergic alveolitis, histiocytosis X). Therapeutic indications: alveolar proteinosis.1 Complications: Hypoxia (give sup- plemental O2), transient fever, transient CXR shadow, infection (rare). Lung biopsy May be performed in several ways. Percutaneous needle biopsy is performed under radiological guidance and is useful for peripheral lung and pleural lesions. Transbronchial biopsy performed at bronchoscopy may help in diagnos- ing interstitial lung diseases, eg sarcoidosis, idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis. Alterna- tives: If unsuccessful, consider open lung biopsy or video-assisted thoracoscopy. Surgical procedures are performed under general anaesthetic. Rigid bronchos- copy provides a wide lumen, enables
