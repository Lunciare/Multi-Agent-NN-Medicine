described as ‘complex’.)Aware- ness is impaired—either at seizure onset or following a simple partial aura. Most commonly arise from the temporal lobe, in which post-ictal confusion is a fea- ture. • Evolving to a bilateral, convulsive seizure: (Previously described as ‘secondary generalized’.) In ⅔ of patients with partial seizures, the electrical disturbance, which start s focally, spreads widely, causing a generalized seizure, which is typi- cally convulsive. Generalized seizures Originating at some point within, and rapidly engaging bilaterally distributed networks leading to simultaneous onset of widespread electrical discharge with no localizing features referable to a single hemisphere. Important subtypes include: • Absence seizures: Brief (≤10s) pauses, eg suddenly stops talking in mid-sen- tence, then carries on where left off . Presents in childhood. • Tonic–clonic seizures: Loss of consciousness. Limbs stiff en (tonic), then jerk (clonic). May have one without the other. Post-ictal confusion and drowsiness. • Myoclonic seizures: Sudden jerk of a limb, face, or trunk. The patient may be thrown suddenly to the ground, or have a violently disobedient limb: one patient described it as ‘my fl ying-saucer epilepsy’, as crockery which happened to be in the hand would take off . • Atonic (akinetic) seizures: Sudden loss
