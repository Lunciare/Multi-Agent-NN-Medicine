Acute limb ischaemia Surgical emergency requiring revascularization within 4–6h to save the limb. May be due to thrombosis in situ (~40%), emboli (38%), graft/angioplasty occlu- sion (15%), or trauma. Thrombosis more likely in known ‘vasculopaths’; emboli are sudden, eg in those without previous vessel disease; they can aff ect multiple sites, and there may be a bruit. Mortality: 22%. Amputation rate: 16%. • Symptoms and signs: The 6 ‘P’S of acute ischaemia: pale, pulseless, painful, paralysed, paraesthetic, and ‘perishingly cold’. Onset of fi xed mottling implies irreversibility. Emboli commonly arise from the heart (AF; mural thrombus) or aneurysms. In patients with known PAD, sudden deterioration of symptoms with deep duskiness of the limb may indicate acute arterial occlusion. This ap- pearance is due to extensive pre–existing collaterals and must not be misdiag-
