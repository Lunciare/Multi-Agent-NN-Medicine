so it is diffi cult to as- cribe the true location of a lobe on a PA image without additional information from a lateral view. It may therefore be better to use the term ‘zone’ rather than lobe when localizing a lesion. Opacifi cation Lung opacities are described as nodular, reticular (network of fi ne lines, interstitial), or alveolar (fl uff y). A single nodule may be called a space-occupying lesion (SOL). Nodules: (If >3cm across, the term pulmonary mass is used instead.) • Neoplasia: metastases (often missed if small), lung cancer, hamartoma, adenoma. • Infections: varicella pneumonia, septic emboli, abscess (eg as an SOL), hydatid. • Granulomas: miliary TB, sarcoidosis (see GPA, p714), histoplasmosis. • Pneumoconioses (except asbestosis), Caplan’s syndrome (p696). Reticular opacifi cation: =Lung parenchymal changes. • Acute interstitial oedema. • Infection: acute (viral, bacterial), chronic (TB, histoplasmosis). • Fibrosis: usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), non-specifi c interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), drugs (eg methotrexate, bleomycin, crack cocaine), connective tissue dis- orders (rheumatoid arthritis—p546, GPA—p714, SLE, PAN, systemic sclerosis—p552, sarcoidosis), industrial lung diseases (silicosis, asbestosis). • Malignancy (lymphangitis carcinomatosa). Alveolar opacifi cation: = Airspace opacifi cation, can be due to any material fi lling the alveoli: • Pus—pneumonia. • Blood—haemorrhage, DIC
