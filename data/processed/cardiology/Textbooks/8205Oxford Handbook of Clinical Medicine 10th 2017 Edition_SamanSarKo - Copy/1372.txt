Management: Urgent CT/MRI depending on underlying diagnosis, disease stage, and performance status. Dexamethasone 16mg/24h to reduce cerebral oedema. Stereo- tactic radiotherapy (see p527). Discuss with neurosurgery, especially if large lesion or associated hydrocephalus. Tumour lysis syndrome Chemotherapy for rapidly proliferating tumours (leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma) leads to cell death and urate, K+, phosphate, calcium. Risk of arrhythmia and renal failure (see p314). Management: Prevent with hydration and uricolytics, eg rasburicase, allopurinol. Paraneoplastic syndromes Paraneoplastic syndromes13 (table 11.3) consist of symptoms attributable to a malig- nancy mediated by hormones, cytokines, or the cross-reaction of tumour antibodies. They do not correlate with stage/prognosis and may pre-date other cancer symptoms.
