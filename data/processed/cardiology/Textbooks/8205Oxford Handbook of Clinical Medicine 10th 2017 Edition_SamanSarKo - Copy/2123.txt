of poisoning presentation can be: • Mild: Dizziness, anxiety, tachycardia, nausea, drowsiness/confusion. • Moderate: Vomiting, reduced consciousness, convulsions, cyanosis. • Severe: Deep coma, fi xed unreactive pupils, cardiorespiratory failure, arrhythmias, pulmonary oedema. Treatment: 100% O2, GI deconta mination. If mild, supportive care is usually suf- fi cient. If moderate/severe then specifi c treatment to bind cyanide is required. Give sodium nitrite/sodium thiosulfate, or dicobalt edetate 300mg IV over 1min, then 50mL 50% glucose IV (repeat once if no response after a minute); or hydroxocobala- min (Cyanokit∏) 5g over 15min repeated once if required. Get expert help. See p847. Carbon monoxide Despite hypoxaemia skin is pink (or pale), not blue, as carboxyhae- moglobin (COHb) displaces O2 from Hb binding sites. For the same reasons SpO2 from a pulse oximeter may be normal. Check ABG in a co-oximeter (ie ensure it meas- ures haemoglobin, SaO2, Meth-Hb and COHb) which will show low SaO2 and high COHb (normal <5%). Symptoms: Headache, vomiting, pulse, tachypnoea, and, if COHb >50%, fi ts, coma, and cardiac arrest. Treatment: Remove the source. Give 100% O2 until COHb <10%. Metabolic acido- sis usually responds to correction of hypoxia. If severe, anticipate cerebral oedema and give mannitol IVI (p831).
