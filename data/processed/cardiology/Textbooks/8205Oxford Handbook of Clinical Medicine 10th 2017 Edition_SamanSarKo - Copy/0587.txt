ovarian syndrome (PCOS) causes secondary oligo- or amenorrhoea, infertility, obesity, acne, and hirsutism (OHCS p252). Ultrasound: bilateral polycystic ovaries. Blood tests: testosterone (if ≥6nmol/L, look for an androgen-producing adrenal or ovarian tumour), sex- hormone binding globulin, LH : FSH ratio (not consistent), TSH, lipids. Address any feel- ings of lack of conformity to society’s perceived norms of feminine beauty. Management: Healthy eating, optimize weight, shaving; laser photoepilation; wax; creams, eg efl ornithine, or ele c trolysis (expensive/time-consuming, but eff ective); bleach (1 : 10 hydrogen peroxide). • Oestrogens: combined contraceptive pill (OHCS p302)—Yasmin® is one choice as its progestogen, drospirenone, is an antimineralocorticoid. Alternatively, co-cyprindiol provided there are no contraindications, such as uncontrolled hypertension and current breast cancer. Stop co-cyprindiol 3–4 months after hirsutism has complete- ly resolved because of increased VTE risk. If COCS are contraindicated or have not worked (after 6/12), refer the woman to secondary care for specialist treatment: • Metformin (helps with insulin resistance) and spironolactone are sometimes tried. • Clomifene is used for infertility (a fertility expert should prescribe). Virilism Onset of amenorrhoea, clitoromegaly, deep voice, temporal hair recession + hirsutism. Look for an androgen-secreting adrenal or ovarian tumour. Gynaecomastia (ie abnormal amount of breast
