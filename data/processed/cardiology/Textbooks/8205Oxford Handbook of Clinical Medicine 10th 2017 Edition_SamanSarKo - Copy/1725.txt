given volume in the intravascular space), as well as for maintaining hydration. Hypertonic and hypotonic saline solutions are also available, but are for specialist use only. Colloids: (eg Gelofusine®.) Have a high osmotic content similar to that of plasma and therefore remain in the intravascular space for longer than other fl uids, making them appropriate for fl uid resuscitation, but not for general hydration. Colloids are expensive, and may cause anaphylactic reactions. In reality, eff ective fl uid resuscita- tion will use a combination of colloid and 0.9% saline. Hypertonic glucose (10% or 50%): May be used in the treatment of hypoglycaemia. It is irritant to veins, so care in its use is needed. Infusion sites should be inspected regularly, and fl ushed with 0.9% saline after use. Glucose with sodium chloride: (One-fi fth ‘normal saline.’) Isotonic, containing 0.18% saline (30mmol/L of Na+) and 4% glucose (222mmol/L). It has roughly the quantity of Na+ required for normal fl uid maintenance, when given 10-hourly in adults, but is now most commonly used in a paediatric setting. Hartmann’s solution: Contains Na+ 131mmol, ClΩ 111mmol, lactate 29mmol, K+ 5mmol, HCO3Ω 29mmol, and Ca2+ 2mmol per litre of fl uid. It is an alternative
