go awry in Parkinson’s disease, schizo- phrenia, and addiction to drugs and gambling, by aff ecting motor control, motiva- tion, eff ort, reward, analgesia, stress, learning, attention, and cognition. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 444488 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN Table 10.1 Major neurotransmitters and associated drugs 449 Drugs increasing activity (≈ agonists) Drugs decreasing activity (≈ antagonists) Dopamine Acts on receptors D1–5; aff ects mood and reward-seeking behaviour. Pramipexole, ropinirole, levodopa, Chlorpromazine (schizophrenia, OHCS p340) apomorphine (Parkinson’s*) Metoclopramide (nausea) Cabergoline (hyperprolactina emia; Inhibition of dopamine signalling may lead to acromegaly). drug induced parkinsonism. Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) Many receptor types 5HT1–7; multiple eff ects. Lithium (mood stabilizer) Ondansetron (nausea) Sumatriptan (migraine) Mirtazapine (depression) Buspirone (partial agonist; anxiety) Olanzapine, clozapine (schizophrenia) Fluoxetine, sertraline (reuptake inhibi- tors; depression). Amino acids Glutamate and aspartate act as excitatory transmitters on NMDA and non-NMDA receptors—relevant in epilepsy and CNS ischaemia. -amino butyric acid (GABA) is mostly inhibitory. Gabapentin, valproate (GABA agonists; Memantine (glutamate antagonist; epilepsy and neuropathic pain) dementia) Benzodiazepines (GABA agonists; seda- tion) Baclofen (GABA agonists; spasticity) Alcohol (GABA agonist)† Acetylcholine Multiple receptors classed into muscarinic and nicotinic types. Peripher- al agonists used in glaucoma (pilocarpine); myasthenia (anticholinesterases). Peripheral antagonists used in asthma (ipratropium); incont inence; to dry secretions pre-op;
