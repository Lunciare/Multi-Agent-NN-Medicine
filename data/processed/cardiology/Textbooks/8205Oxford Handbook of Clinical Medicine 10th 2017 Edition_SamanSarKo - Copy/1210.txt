the contralateral ear in SNHL, and to the midline if both ears are normal (or if bilateral SNHL). Conductive deafness Causes: Wax (remove, eg by syringing with warm water af- ter softening with olive oil drops), otosclerosis, otitis media, or glue ear (OHCS p546). Chronic sensorineural deafness Often due to accumulated environmental noise toxicity, presbyacusis, or inherited disorders. Presbyacusis: Loss of acuity for high- frequency sounds starts before 30yrs old. We do not usually notice it until hearing of speech is aff ected. Hearing is most aff ected in the presence of background noise. Hearing aids are the usual treatment. Sudden sensorineural deafness Get an ENT opinion today (steroids may cure)! Causes: Noise exposure; gentamicin/other toxin; mumps; acoustic neuroma; MS; stroke; vasculitis; TB. Tests: ESR, FBC, LFT, pANCA, viral titres and TB (see BOX ‘Diagnostic tests for TB’, p394); evoked response audiometry; CXR; MRI; lymph node and naso- pharyngeal biopsy for culture. Tinnitus This ringing or buzzing in the ears is common, and may cause depression or insomnia. Investigate unilateral tinnitus fully to exclude an acoustic neuroma (p462). Causes Inner ear damage and hearing loss (leading to auditory cortex hyper-excit- ability), wax, excess noise, head injury, otitis media, post-stapedectomy, Ménière’s,
