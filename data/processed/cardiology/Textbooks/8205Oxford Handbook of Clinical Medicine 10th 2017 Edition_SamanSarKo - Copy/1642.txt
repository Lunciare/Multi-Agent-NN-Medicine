ulcer/chronic pancreatitis/tumour. Other presentations • Obstructive jaundice with CBD stones: (See p272.) If LFT worsening, ERCP with sphincterotomy ± biliary trawl, then cholecystectomy may be needed, or open sur- gery with CBD exploration. If CBD stones are suspected pre-operatively, they should be identifi ed by MRCP (p742). • Cholangitis: (Bile duct infection.) Causing RUQ pain, jaundice, and rigors (Charcot’s triad, BOX ‘Complications of gallstones’). Treat with, eg piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h IV. • Gallstone ileus: A stone erodes through the GB into the duodenum; it may then obstruct the terminal ileum. AXR shows: air in CBD (= pneumobilia), small bowel fl uid levels, and a stone. Duodenal obstruction is rarer (Bouveret’s syndrome). • Pancreatitis: See p636. • Mucocoele/empyema: Obstructed GB fi lls with mucus (secreted by GB wall)/pus. • Silent stones: Do elective surgery on those with sickle cell, immunosuppression, (debatably diabetes) as well as all calcifi ed/porcelain GBS. • Mirizzi’s syndrome: A stone in the GB presses on the bile duct causing jaundice. • Gallbladder necrosis: Rare because of dual blood supply (hepatic artery via cystic artery, and from small branches of the hepatic artery in the GB fossa). • Other: Causes of cholecystitis and biliary symptoms other than gallstones are
