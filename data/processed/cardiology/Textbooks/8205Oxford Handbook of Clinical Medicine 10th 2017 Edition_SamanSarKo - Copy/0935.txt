Chemoradiotherapy Radiotherapy + short courses of chemotherapy for stages I-A and II-A (eg with ≤3 areas involved). Longer courses of chemotherapy for II-A with >3 areas involved through to IV-B. ‘ABVD’: Adriamycin (doxorubicin), Bleomy- cin, Vinblastine, Dacarbazine cures ~80% of patients. More intensive regimens are used if poor prognosis or advanced disease.8 In relapsed disease: high-dose chem- otherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation.
