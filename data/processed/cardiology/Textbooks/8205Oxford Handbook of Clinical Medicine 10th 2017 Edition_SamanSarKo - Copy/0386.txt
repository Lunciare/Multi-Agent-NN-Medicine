heart-phrases result from poetic extrapola- tions of heart/self ideas and have no physiological explanation, eg ‘he wears his heart on his sleeve’. Evidence is building that heart/self interactions exist beyond metaphor and symp- tomatic ‘fl ight-or-fi ght’ responses. Aff ective disorders, certain personality types, and traumatic life-experiences increase the risk of cardiac disease, even when life- style factors are controlled for.54–56 In ‘broken heart syndrome’ (Takotsubo cardio- myopathy), ventricular contraction morphology changes in response to emotional or physical stress (fi g 3.43). It mimics a myocardial infarction in terms of clinical history, ECG changes, and troponin rises, but the prognosis and management may be quite diff erent so accurate diagnosis is important. As physicians, we often focus on explainable physical aspects of disease, but the physical and psychosocial are inconveniently related and both should be assessed to determine best management. Should an IHD suff erer be off ered CBT alongside their statins? Could a grieving patient’s ‘MI’ be Takotsubo cardiomyopathy? To an- swer these questions we must look beyond ECGs and troponin, to the ‘heart-ache’ of the literary and philosophical kinds. (a) (b) Fig 3.43 (a) Left ventriculogram of a heart in diastole.
