Pathophysiology HIV binds, via its GP120 envelope glycoprotein, to CD4 receptors on helper T cells, monocytes, and macrophages. These ‘CD4 cells’ migrate to lymphoid tissue where the virus replicates, producing billions of new virions. These are released, and in turn infect new CD4 cells. As infection progresses, depletion or impaired function of CD4 cells leads to immune function. HIV is a retrovirus: it encodes reverse transcriptase, allowing DNA copies to be produced from viral RNA. This is error prone, meaning a signifi cant mutation rate, which contributes to treatment resistance. Prevention Sexual transmission: Consistent and correct use of (male and female) condoms  transmission by ~90%. Serosorting is the restriction of (unprotected) sex depend- ing on HIV status. It is unsafe due to inaccuracies in HIV status (which is only as reliable as a person’s last test) and failure to disclose. It does not consider transfer of treatment resistance, other STIs, or hepatitis. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP): The short-term
