Calcium chan- nel blockers and nitrates may also relax the sphincter. Benign oesophageal stricture: Caused by gastro-oesophageal refl ux (GORD, p254), corrosives, surgery, or radiotherapy. Treatment: endoscopic balloon dilatation. Oesophageal cancer: (p618.) Associations: , GORD, tobacco, alcohol, Barrett’s oesophagus (p695), tylosis (palmar hyperkeratosis), Plummer–Vinson syndrome (post-cricoid dysphagia, upper oesophageal web + iron- defi ciency). CNS causes: Ask for help from a speech and language therapist. Nausea and vomiting Consider pregnancy where appropriate! Other causes, p56. What’s in the vomit? Reports of ‘coff ee grounds’ may indicate upper GI bleeding but represent one of the most over-called signs in clinical medicine — always verify yourself and look for other evidence of GI bleeding; recognizable food ≈ gastric stasis; feculent ≈ small bowel obstruction. Timing Morning ≈ pregnancy or ICP; 1h post food ≈ gastric stasis/gastroparesis (DM); vomiting that relieves pain ≈ peptic ulcer; preceded by loud gurgling ≈ GI obstruction. Tests Bloods: FBC, U&E, LFT, Ca2+, glucose, amylase. ABG: A metabolic (hypochlor- aemic) alkalosis from loss of gastric contents (pH >7.45, HCO3 Ω) indicates severe vomiting. Plain AXR: If suspected bowel obstruction (p728). Upper GI endoscopy: (See p248.) If suspicion of bleed or persistent vomiting. Consider head CT in case ICP.
