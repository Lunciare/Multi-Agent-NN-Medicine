this method, owing to the anatomy of their aneurysm. Lifelong moni- toring is needed: stents may leak and the an- eurysm progress (the risk can be reduced by coiling the internal iliac arteries, as shown).

The chief feature of PAD is intermittent claudication (= to limp). Prevalence = 10%. Symptoms Cramping pain in the calf, thigh, or buttock after walking for a given distance (the claudication distance) and relieved by rest (calf claudication suggests femoral disease while buttock claudication suggests iliac disease). Ulceration, gan- grene (p660), and foot pain at rest—eg burning pain at night relieved by hanging legs over side of bed—are the cardinal features of critical ischaemia. Buttock claudica- tion ± impotence imply Leriche’s syndrome (p704). Young, heavy smokers are at risk from Buerger’s disease (thromboangiitis obliterans, p696). Fontaine classifi cation for PAD: 1 Asymptomatic. 2 Intermittent claudication.
