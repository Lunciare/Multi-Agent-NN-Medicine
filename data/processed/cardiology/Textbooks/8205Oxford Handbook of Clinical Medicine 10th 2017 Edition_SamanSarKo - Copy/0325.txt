extra chest leads were added (V7–9), we would see the classic ST elevation pattern, see p 98. The ST elevation in V6 sug- gests lateral infarction. A blockage in the circumfl ex coronary artery could explain both the posterior and lateral changes. Cardiovascular medicine __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 112211 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 121 122 Complications of MI Cardiac arrest (See p894, fi g A3.) Cardiogenic shock (p802.) Left ventricular failure (p136, p800, p802.) Bradyarrhythmias Sinus bradycardia: See p808. Patients with inferior MIs may suff er atropine-unresponsive bradycardia due to infarction of nodal tissue. 1st-de- gree AV block: Most commonly seen in inferior MI. Observe closely as approximately 40% develop higher degrees of AV block (in which case calcium channel blockers and -blockers should be stopped). Wenckebach phenomenon: (Mobitz type I) Does not require pacing unless poorly tolerated. Mobitz type II block: Carries a high risk of developing sudden complete AV block; should be paced. Complete AV block: Usually resolves within a few days. Insert pacemaker (may not be necessary after inferior MI if narrow QRS, reasonably stable and pulse 40–50). Bundle branch block: MI complicated by trifascicular block or non-adjacent bifascicular disease (p132) should be paced. Tachyarrhythmias NB: K+, hypoxia, and acidosis all predispose
