these with whatever you al- ready know of the patient. The abnormality may be hiding in plain sight, but if struggling, step back and note any asymmetry or areas that just ‘look diff erent’. • With cross-sectional imaging, scan through adjacent sections noting the anato- my of one organ system or structure at a time (this may mean going up and down through a CT abdomen multiple times). • Giving a diff erential diagnosis is good practice, as not all fi ndings are diagnostic. • If there is additional clinical information that would help you to make a diagno- sis, don’t be afraid to ask. After all, we treat patients and not images! Remember: •X-ray=radiodensity (lucency/opacity). •CT=attenuation. •US=echogenicity. •MRI=signal intensity. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 772211 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR 722 Chest X-ray—part 1 Images are usually taken on inspiration with the X-ray source behind the patient (postero-anterior, PA). Mobile images may be antero-posterior (AP, fi g 16.6), magnify- ing heart size. If supine, distribution of air and fl uid in lungs and pleural cavities is altered and the diaphragm is elevated. Acclimatize yourself to the four cardinal elements of the chest radiograph, memo- rably (albeit slightly inaccurately) termed bone, air, fat, and ‘water’/soft tissue.
