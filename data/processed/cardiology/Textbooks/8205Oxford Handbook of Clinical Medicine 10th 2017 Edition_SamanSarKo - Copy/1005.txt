Person-to-person transmission via droplets or upper respiratory tract secre- tions. Most strains are harmless but induce immunity. Pathogenic, virulent strains are mostly encapsulated and have the potential to cause septicaemia and meningitis. Serogroups A, B, C, W and Y account for nearly all invasive forms. Group C following introduction of vaccination in UK.  in serotype W in UK since 2009. Incubation 2–7d. Peak ages: <2yr, ~18yr. Risk factors: complement system defects, hyposplenism, HIV. Presentation: 1 Meningitis (~50% cases). Main proliferation of bacteria is in CSF. Insidious onset with malaise, nausea, headache, vomiting. May be misdiagnosed as gastroenteri- tis, URTI, or childhood viral illness. Later meningism: headache, vomiting, nuchal/ back rigidity, photophobia, altered consciousness. Complications in up to 20%: sensorineural hearing loss, impaired vestibular function, epilepsy, diff use brain injury. 2 Meningococcaemia. Symptoms/signs depends on amount of circulating bacte- ria. Mild disease presents with fever, macular rash (fi g 9.6) but no signs of shock. High-grade meningococcaemia (~30% cases)
