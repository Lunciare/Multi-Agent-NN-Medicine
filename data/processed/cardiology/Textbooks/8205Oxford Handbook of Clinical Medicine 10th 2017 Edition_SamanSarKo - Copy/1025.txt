It off ers a global alert mechanism for viruses with pandemic potential and defi nes methodologies for assessing antiviral susceptibility. Cooperation between international and nation- al public health bodies is required for an understanding of clinical characteristics and disease spread. Communication to the individual (public and social media) is needed with advice about self-isolation, when and how to seek medical help, personal hygiene. • Protect: vaccine development and production capacity (stockpiling), adequate personal protective equipment (apron, gloves, well-fi tting mask), antiviral ad- ministration according to robust evidence and sensitivity. • Animals: limiting/eliminating the animal reservoir of virus by culling, restricting animal movement, vaccination of livestock. • Research: virus characteristics, disease severity predictors, epidemiological risk factors, antiviral development, targeting of treatment and vaccination, increased-spectrum vaccines with longer-lasting immunity, eff ective healthcare worker protection, evidence-based social distancing measures. Hide and seek In 2009, there was justifi able global concern about a ‘swine fl u’ pandemic. Based on a Cochrane review in 2008, which showed reduced complications with os- eltamivir, billions were spent stockpiling the drug worldwide. In
