• Spontaneous bleeding/DIC • Shock (BP <90/60) = ‘Algid malaria’ • Acidosis (pH <7.3) • Hypoglycaemia (<2.2mmol/L) • Haemoglobinuria • Pulmonary oedema/ARDS • Parasitaemia >10%. Remember other poor prognostic indicators: peripheral blood schizonts (see p417), elevated serum lactate, age. Uncomplicated falciparum malaria: Artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) achieve rapid clearance of parasites by combined action at diff erent stages of the parasite cycle (p417): 1 Artemether-lumefantrine:4 tablets at 0, 4, 8, 24, 36, 48, and 60h. 1st line in UK (including pregnant >13wks), take with high-fat food to  absorption. 2 Dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-piperaquine: 4 tablets OD for 3d (if weight >60kg). Take >3h before and after food to prevent excessive peak levels. Possible QTC  avoid in arrhythmia. Options if ACT not available: • Atovaquone-proguanil: 4 tablets OD for 3 days. Parasite clearance ~66% after 3d, GI side-eff ects in ~25%. • Oral quinine sulphate 600mg TDS for 5–7d plus doxycycline 200mg OD (or clinda- mycin 450mg TDS if pregnant) for 7d. Parasite monitoring required. Can cause ‘cin- chonism’: nausea, deafness, ringing in ears. Resistance to ACT is emerging in Asia. Failure rates with antifolate drugs mean Fansidar® is no longer used. Chloroquine is not used in the treatment of falciparum
