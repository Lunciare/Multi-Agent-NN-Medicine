Common to all aetiologies of AKI is the need to manage fl uid balance, acidosis, hyper- kalaemia, and the timely recognition of those who may require renal replacement. Fluid balance Volume status: • Hypovolaemia: BP, urine volume, non-visible JVP, poor tissue turgor, pulse, daily weight loss. • Fluid overload: BP, JVP, lung crepitations, peripheral oedema, gallop rhythm. Hypotension may be relative in old age, vascular stiff ness, untreated BP. JVP does not refl ect intravascular volume if right-sided heart disease/failure. BP, skin turgor, capillary refi ll changes may be late—do not wait for them.
