roidism urea) • Gluco- corticoid insuffi ciency Fig 14.3 Hyponatraemia. Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) An important, but over-diagnosed, cause of hyponatraemia. The diagnosis re- quires concentrated urine (Na+ > 20mmol/L and osmolality > 100mosmol/kg) in the presence of hypon atraemia (plasma Na+ < 125mmol/L) and low plasma osmolality (< 260mosmol/kg), in the absence of hypovolaemia, oedema, or diuretics. Causes: • Malignancy: lung small-cell, pancreas, prostate, thymus, or lymphoma. • CNS disorders: meningoencephalitis, abscess, stroke, subarachnoid or subdural haemorrhage, head injury, neurosurgery, Guillain–Barré, vasculitis, or SLE. • Chest disease: TB, pneumonia, abscess, aspergillosis, small-cell lung cancer. • Endocrine disease: hypothyroidism (not true SIADH, but perhaps due to excess ADH release from carotid sinus baroreceptors triggered by  cardiac output). • Drugs: opiates, psychotropics, SSRIs, cytotoxics. • Other: acute intermittent porphyria, trauma, major abdominal or thoracic sur- gery, symptomatic HIV. Treatment: Treat the cause and restrict fl uid. Consider salt ± loop diuretic if severe. Demeclocycline is used rarely. Vasopressin receptor antagonists (‘vaptans’, p672) are an emerging class of drug used in SIADH and other types of hyponatraemia. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 667733 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC 674 Hyperkalaemia A plasma potassium >6.5mmol/L is a potential emergency and needs urgent as- sessment (see
