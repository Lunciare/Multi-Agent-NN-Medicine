Iron will continue to accumulate, so maintenance venesection is needed for life (1U every 2–3 months to maintain haematocrit <0.5, ferritin <100mcg/L, and transferrin saturation <40%). Consider desferrioxamine (p342) if intolerant of this. Monitor: LFT and glucose/ diabetes (p206). HbA1c levels may be falsely low as venesection  the time available for Hb glycosylation. If cirrhotic, screen for HCC with ultrasound ± AFP twice-yearly. Over-the-counter drugs: Ensure vitamin preparations contain no iron. Diet: A well-balanced diet should be encouraged—there is no need to avoid iron-rich foods. Avoid alcohol. Avoid uncooked seafood (may contain bacteria that thrive on increased plasma iron concentrations, eg Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio vulnifi cus). Screening: Serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and HFE genotype. Screen 1st- degree relatives by genetic testing even if they are asymptomatic and have normal LFT ideally prior to age where signifi cant iron deposition likely to have occurred (eg 18–30yrs). Since C282Y homozygotes may never develop iron overload, population screening should not be performed. Prognosis Venesection returns life expectancy to normal if non-diabetic and non-cir- rhotic (and liver histology can improve). Arthropathy may improve or worsen. Gonadal failure may reverse in younger men. If cirrhosis, 22–30% get hepatocellular cancer, especially if: age >50yrs (risk
