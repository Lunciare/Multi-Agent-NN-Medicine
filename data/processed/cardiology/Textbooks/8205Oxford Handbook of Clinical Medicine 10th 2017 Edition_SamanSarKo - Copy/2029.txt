airway—give 100% O2 Intubate if respiratory obstruction imminent Remove the cause; raising the feet may help restore the circulation Give adrenaline IM 0.5mg (ie 0.5mL of 1:1000). Repeat every 5min, if needed as guided by BP, pulse, and respiratory function, until better Secure IV access Chlorphenamine 10mg IV and hydrocortisone 200mg IV IVI (0.9% saline, eg 500mL over ¼h; up to 2L may be needed) Titrate against blood pressure If wheeze, treat for asthma (p810) May require ventilatory support If still hypotensive, admission to ICU and an IVI of adrena- line may be needed ± aminophylline (p811) and nebulized salbutamol (p811): get expert help Further management: • Admit to ward. Monitor ECG • Measure serum tryptase 1–6h after suspected anaphylaxis • Continue chlorphenamine 4mg/6h PO if itching • Suggest a ‘MedicAlert’ bracelet naming the culprit allergen • Teach about self-injected adrenaline (eg 0.3mg, Epipen®) to prevent a fatal attack • Skin-prick tests showing specifi c IgE help identify allergens to avoid Fig 19.4 Management of anaphylaxis. Adrenaline (=epinephrine) is given IM and NOT IV unless the patient is severely ill, or has no pulse. The IV dose is different: 100mcg/min—titrating with the response. This is 0.5mL of 1 : 10
