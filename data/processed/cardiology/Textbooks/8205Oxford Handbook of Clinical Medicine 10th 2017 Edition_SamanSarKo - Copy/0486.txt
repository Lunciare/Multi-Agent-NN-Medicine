is likely to be a respiratory 2 problem (eg high pCOand pH <7.35 = likely a respiratory acidosis). If the HCOΩ 2 3 is in keeping with the pH, this is suggestive of a metabolic problem (eg high HCOΩ and pH > 7.45 = metabolic alkalosis). 3 Table 4.7 Interpreting blood gas analysis pH PaCO HCOΩ 2 3 Metabolic acidosis Low Normal/low Low Respiratory acidosis Low High Normal/high Metabolic alkalosis High Normal/high High Respiratory alkalosis High Low Normal/low Steps to ABG interpretation: 1 pH: acidosis or alkalosis? 2 pCO: high/low? Does this fi t with the pH? (if yes, think respiratory problem) 2 3 HCOΩ: high/low? Does this fi t with pH? (if yes, think metabolic problem) 3 4 PO: is this normal given the FiO (fraction of inspired oxygen)? 2 2 5 Is there any compensation? (i.e. changes in PCO/HCOΩ to try and correct an un- 2 3 derlying imbalance). Is this partial (pH abnormal) or complete (pH normalized)? 6 Calculate the anion gap. Helpful in working out aetiology of metabolic acidosis. Anion gap: (Na+ + K+) Ω (ClΩ + HCOΩ) 3 See p670 for causes of raised anion gap (normal 10–18mmol/L).
