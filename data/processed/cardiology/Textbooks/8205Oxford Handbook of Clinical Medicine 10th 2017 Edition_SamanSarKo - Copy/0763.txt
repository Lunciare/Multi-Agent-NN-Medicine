This is a crude way of checking whether the urine contains anything that it should not, eg protein, blood, glucose. Abnormalities can indicate intrinsic renal disease or renal tract abnormali- ties and usually require further investigation. However, a dipstick-positive catheter sample is diffi cult to interpret. Look for a urine dip result (before the catheter was inserted). A positive result indicates the need for specialist advice from nephrology/urology. A negative result may help to reassure you about the absence of intrinsic renal disease. Proteinuria Requires quantifi cation. 24h collections are rarely used due to inaccuracy. Albumin:creatinine ratio (A:CR) or protein:creatinine ratio (P:CR) is performed on a random spot urine sample. Normal A:CR is <2.5() or <3.5(). P:CR is <15. Approximate equivalent levels of proteinuria are given in table 7.1.
