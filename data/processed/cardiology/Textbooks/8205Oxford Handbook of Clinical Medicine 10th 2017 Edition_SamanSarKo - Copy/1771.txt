The most abundant is albumin (see fi g 14.12). Albumin Synthesized in the liver; t½ ≈ 20d. It binds bilirubin, free fatty acids, Ca2+, and some drugs. Low albumin: Results in oedema, and is caused by: •synthesis: liver disease, acute phase response (due to vascular permeability—eg sepsis, trau- ma, surgery), malabsorption, malnutrition, malignancy •loss: nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enteropathy, burns •haemodilution: late pregnancy, artefact (eg from ‘drip’ arm). Also posture (5g/L if upright) and genetic variations. High albumin: Causes are dehydration; artefact (eg stasis). Immunoglobulins (Antibodies) are synthesized by B cells. Five isoforms Ig A,D,E,G,M exist in humans, and IgG is the most abundant circulating form. Specifi c monoclonal band in paraproteinaemia (see p370). Diffusely
