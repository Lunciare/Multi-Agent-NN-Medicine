UTIs; voiding irritability. Associations Smoking; aromatic amines (rubber industry); chronic cystitis; schisto- somiasis (risk of squamous cell carcinoma); pelvic irradiation. Tests • Cystoscopy with biopsy is diagnostic. • Urine: microscopy/cytology (cancers may cause sterile pyuria). • CT urogram is both diagnostic and provides staging. • Bimanual EUA helps assess spread. • MRI or lymphangiography may show involved pelvic nodes. Staging See table 13.19. Treating TCC of the bladder • Tis/Ta/T1: (80% of all patients) Diathermy via transurethral cystoscopy/trans- urethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). Consider a regimen of intravesical BCG (which stimulates a non-specifi c immune response) for multiple small tumours or high-grade tumours. Alternative chemotherapeutic agents include mitomycin, epirubicin and gemcitabine. 5yr survival ≈ 95%. • T2–3: Radical cystectomy is the ‘gold standard’. Radiotherapy gives worse 5yr survival rates than surgery, but preserves the bladder. ‘Salvage’ cystectomy can be performed if radiotherapy fails, but yields worse results than primary sur- gery. Post-op chemotherapy (eg M-VAC: methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) is toxic but eff ective. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with M-VAC or GC (gemcitabine and cisplatin) has improved survival compared to cystectomy or ra- diotherapy alone.
