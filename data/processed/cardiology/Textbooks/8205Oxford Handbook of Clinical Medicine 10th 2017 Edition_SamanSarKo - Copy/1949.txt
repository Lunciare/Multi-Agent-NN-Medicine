a gloved hand to clean urethral meatus in a pubis-to-anus direction, hold- ing the labia apart with the other hand. With uncircumcised men, retract the foreskin to clean the glans; use a gloved hand to hold the penis still. The hand used to hold the penis or labia should not touch the catheter. Place a sterile drape with a hole in the middle to help you maintain asepsis. Remember: left hand dirty, right hand clean. • Put sterile lidocaine 1–2% gel on the catheter tip and ≤10mL into the urethra (≤5mL if ). In men, lift and gently stretch the penis upwards to eliminate any urethral folds that may lead to false passage formation. • Use steady gentle pressure to advance the catheter, rotating slightly can help it slide in. Never force the catheter. Tilting the penis up towards the umbilicus while inserting may help negotiate the prostate. Insert to the hilt; wait until urine emerg- es before infl ating the balloon. Remember to check the balloon’s capacity before in- fl ation (written on the outer end). Collect a sterile specimen and attach a drainage bag. Pull the catheter back so that the balloon comes to rest at the bladder
