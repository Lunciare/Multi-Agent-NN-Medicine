fi rst 48h). Stop heparin when INR is 2–3; treat for 3 months in most (longer in some cases—see p351). Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACS p190), eg dabigatan, apixaban, rivoraxaban, are newer alternatives licensed for the treatment of DVT with benefi ts relating to simpler dosing and monitoring and  bleeding risk. Inferior vena caval fi lters may be used in active bleeding, or when anticoagulants fail, to minimize risk of PE. Post-phlebitic change (pain, swelling, and skin changes) can be seen in 10–30%— graduated compression stockings may help. Pretest clinical probability scoring for DVT: the Wells score In patients with symptoms in both legs, the more symptomatic leg is used. Table 13.5 Wells score Clinical features Score Active cancer (treatment within last 6 months or palliative) 1 point Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of leg 1 point Recently bedridden for >3d or majory surgery in last 12wks 1 point Local tenderness along distribution of deep venous system 1 point Entire leg swollen 1 point Calf swelling >3cm compared with asymptomatic leg (measured 1 point 10cm below tibial tuberosity) Pitting oedema (greater in the symptomatic leg) 1 point Collateral superfi cial veins (non-varicose) 1 point Previously documented DVT 1 point
