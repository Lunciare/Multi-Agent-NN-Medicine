Symptoms: Fatigue; hepatic pain on exertion (due to hepatic congestion); ascites; oedema and symptoms of the causative condition. Signs: Giant v waves and prominent y descent in JVP (p43); RV heave; pansystolic murmur, heard best at lower sternal edge in inspiration; pulsatile hepatomegaly; jaundice; ascites. Management: Drugs: diuretics for systemic con- gestion; drugs to treat underlying cause. Valve repair or replacement (~10% 30-day mortality). Tricuspid regurgitation resulting from myocardial dysfunction or dilata- tion has a mortality of up to 50% at 5 yrs. Tricuspid stenosis Causes: Main cause is rheumatic fever, which almost always occurs with mitral or aortic valve disease. Also: congenital, infective endocarditis. Symptoms: Fatigue, ascites, oedema. Signs: Giant a wave and slow y descent in JVP (p43); opening snap, early diastolic murmur
