(post-prandial and fasting). There may be lower risk of progression to DM in IFG than IGT. Manage both with lifestyle advice (p93) + annual review. Incidence of DM if IFG and HbA1C at high end of normal (37–46mmol/mol) is ~25%.5 Other causes of DM Steroids; anti-HIV drugs; newer antipsychotics. • Pancreatic: pancreatitis; surgery (where >90% pancreas is removed); trauma; pancreatic destruction (haemochromatosis, cystic fi brosis); pancreatic cancer. • Cushing’s disease; acromegaly; phaeochromocytoma; hyperthyroidism; pregnancy. • Others: congenital lipodystrophy; glycogen storage diseases. Metabolic syndrome (syndrome x) Defi nition from International Diabetes Federa- tion: central obesity (BMI >30, or  waist circ, ethnic-specifi c values), plus two of BP ≥130/85, triglycerides ≥1.7mmol/L, HDL ≤ 1.03/1.29mmol/L, fasting glucose ≥5.6mmol/L or type 2 DM. ~20% are aff ected; weight, genetics, and insulin resistance important in aetiol- ogy. Vascular events—but probably not beyond the combined eff ect of individual risk factors. : Exercise; weight; treat individual components. 1 Chicken or egg? Most type 2 diabetes-associated genes have a function in the vasculature, and stre ss in -cells can result from vascular defects in the pancreas, so maybe vascular events trigger DM.6 __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 220066 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus: WHO criteria (rather arbitrary!) 207
