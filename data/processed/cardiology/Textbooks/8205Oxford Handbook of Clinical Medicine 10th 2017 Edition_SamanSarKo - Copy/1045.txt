changing dose or ART regimen? Resource-limited settings In many resource-limited settings, universal access to ART remains an objective yet to be achieved. ~50% of those in need of treatment for HIV do not receive it. Interim prioritization of those with symptomatic HIV or CD4 count <350 cells/ microlitre may be appropriate as these patients are at high risk of mortality and have most short-term benefi t from ART. Equality in the treatment of HIV requires: • Eff ective, acceptable, and reliable methods to reduce HIV transmission, including treatment as prevention. • Rapid, accurate, and low-cost diagnosis and monitoring. • Standardization and simplifi cation of ART regimens. • Evidence-based ART to prevent the use of sub-standard protocols which compro- mise treatment and lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. • Reduced ART costs and/or eff ective allocation of resources. An HIV vaccine? Vaccines are the most eff ective way to prevent infectious disease. They can also be therapeutic, clearing a virus after infection. HIV vaccines to date have failed to induce an immune response suffi cient to confer protection. Research is ongoing into neutralizing HIV antibodies, peptides, genes, viral vectors, physiological ‘boost- ers’, and mechanisms to counter the mutational evolution of
