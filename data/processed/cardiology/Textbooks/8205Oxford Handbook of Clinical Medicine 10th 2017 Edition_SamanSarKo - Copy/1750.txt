PO43Ω reabsorption in the kidney. Chole- calciferol (vit D3—from animal sources) and ergocalciferol (vit D2—from vegetables) are biologically identical in their activity. Disordered regulation of calcitriol underlies familial normocalca emic hypercalciuria, which is a major cause of calcium oxalate renal stone formation (p638). Calcitonin: Made in C-cells of the thyroid, this causes Ca2+ and PO43Ω, but its physi- ological role is unclear. It can be used as a marker of recurrence or metastasis in medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Magnesium: Mg2+ prevents PTH release, and may cause hypocalcaemia. Plasma binding: Labs usually measure total plasma Ca2+. ~40% is bound to albumin, and the rest is free ionized Ca2+ which is the physiologically important amount (often available on blood gas analyser). Therefore, correct total Ca2+ for albumin as follows: add 0.1mmol/L to Ca2+ level for every 4g/L that albumin is below 40g/L, and a similar subtraction for raised albumin. However, many other factors aff ect binding (eg other proteins in myeloma, cirrhosis, individual variation) so be cautious in your interpreta- tion. If in doubt over a high Ca2+, take blood specimens uncuff ed (remove tourniquet after needle in vein, but before taking blood sample), and with the patient fasted. Hypercalcaemia Signs
