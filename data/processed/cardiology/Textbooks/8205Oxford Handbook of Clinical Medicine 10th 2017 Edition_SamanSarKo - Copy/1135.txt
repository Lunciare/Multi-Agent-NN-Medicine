Treatment: Get help (including surgical). Depends on cyst type, location, size, and complications. Prolonged treatment (months/years) with albendazole. PAIR: Puncture, Aspirate, Inject (hypertonic saline/chemicals), Reaspirate. Beware spillage of cyst contents: praziquantel can be given peri-operatively. Fasciola hepatica (common liver fl uke) Parasitic infection. ~2 million infected worldwide. Highest rates of infection in Bolivia and Peru. Infective larvae develop in aquatic snail hosts. Humans infected via con- taminated water, waterplants eg watercress, or by eating the undercooked liver of another host animal eg sheep, goat. Disease caused by migration of parasite to bile ducts. Presentation: Acute phase with migration from intestine through liver (2–4 months): abdominal pain, nausea, fever, urticarial rash, eosinophilia. Chronic phase with egg production in the bile ducts: cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, cirrho- sis. Diagnosis: Serology in acute and chronic phase. Ova in stool/bile aspirate only in chronic phase. Treatment: Triclabendazole as a single dose. Treat all suspected cases in endemic areas. Other liver fl ukes: opisthorchiasis and clonorchiasis Opisthorchis and clonorchis are liver fl ukes acquired by eating contaminated fi sh, mainly in south-east Asia. Adult worms lodge in the small bile ducts and gallbladder. Presentation: Abdominal pain, GI disturbance, cholecystitis, cholangitis, cholangio- carcinoma. Diagnosis: Ova in stool.
