Assessing the severity of an acute asthma attack Severe attack: • Unable to complete sentences in one breath. • Respiratory rate ≥ 25/min. • Pulse rate ≥110 beats/min. • PEF 33–50% of predicted or best. Life-threatening attack: • PEF <33% of predicted or best. • Silent chest, cyanosis, feeble respiratory eff ort. • Arrhythmia or hypotension. • Exhaustion, confusion, or coma. • Arterial blood gases: • Normal/high PaCO2 >4.6kPa. • PaO2 <8kPa, or SaO2 <92%. Management Rapid treatment and reassessment is key,7 see fi g 19.12. • Salbutamol 5mg nebulized with oxygen and give prednisolone 30mg PO. • If PEF remains <75%, repeat salbutamol; add ipratropium. • Monitor oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory rate. • Admit all with severe features not responding to initial treatment or with life- threatening features. NB: the routine use of antibiotics is not recommended in exacerbations of asthma. Discharge Patients with PEF >75% within 1h of initial treatment can be discharged if no other reason to admit. Otherwise, before discharge patients must have: • been stable on discharge medication for 24h • had inhaler technique checked • peak fl ow rate >75% predicted or best with
