malignancy; rectal surgery; DM; CNS disease, eg transverse myelitis/MS; zoster (S2–S4). Tests Blood: U&E, creatinine, FBC, and prostate-specifi c antigen (PSA, p530).12 Urine: Dipstick and MC&S. Ultrasound (p744) is the imaging modality of choice for investi- gating upper tract obstruction: If there is hydronephrosis or hydroureter (distension of the renal pelvis and calyces or ureter), arrange a CT scan. This will determine the level of obstuction. NB: in ~5% of cases of obstruction, no distension is seen on US. Radionuclide imaging enables functional assessment of the kidneys. Treatment Upper tract obstruction: Nephrostomy or ureteric stent. NB: stents may cause signifi cant discomfort and patients should be warned of this and other risks (see BOX ‘Problems of ureteric stenting’). -blockers help reduce stent-related pain (ureteric spasm). Pyeloplasty, to widen the PUJ, may be performed for idiopathic PUJ obstruction. Lower tract obstruction: Insert a urethral or suprapubic catheter (p762) to relieve acute retention. In chronic obstruction only catheterize patient if there is pain, uri- nary infection, or renal impairment; intermittent self-catheterization is sometimes required (p763). If in clot retention the patient will require a 3-way catheter and bladder washout. If >1L residual check U&E and monitor for post-obstructive diure- sis (see BOX
