there is excessive glucose, but because of a lack of insulin, this cannot be taken up into cells to be metabolized, so pushing the body into a starvation-like state where ketoacidosis is the only mechanism of energy production. The combination of severe acidosis and hyperglycaemia can be deadly, so early recognition and treatment is important. Typical picture Gradual drowsiness, vomiting, and dehydration in type 1 diabetic (very rarely type 2). Do glucose in all those with unexplained vomiting, abdo pain, polyuria, polydipsia, lethargy, anorexia, ketotic breath, dehydration, coma, or deep breathing (sighing ‘Kussmaul’ hyperventilation). Triggers: Infection, eg UTI; surgery; MI; pancreatitis; chemotherapy; antipsychotics; wrong insulin dose/non-compliance. Diagnosis 1 Acidaemia (venous blood pH< 7.3 or HCO3Ω < 15.0mmol/L). 2 Hyperglycaemia (blood glucose> 11.0mmol/L) or known DM. 3 Ketonaemia (≥3.0mmol/L) or signifi cant ketonuria (more than 2+ on dipstick). Tests: ECG, CXR. Urine: Dipstick and MSU. Blood: Capillary and lab glucose, ketones, pH (use venous blood; ABG only if GCS or hypoxia), U&E, HCO3Ω, osmolality, FBC, blood culture. Severe DKA If one or more of the following features is present on admission, con- sider transfer to HDU/ICU for monitoring and central venous access. Get senior help! • Blood ketones >6mmol/L. • O2
