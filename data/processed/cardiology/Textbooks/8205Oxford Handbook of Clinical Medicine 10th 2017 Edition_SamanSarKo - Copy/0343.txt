Diff erentiating VT from SVT with aberrancy This may be diffi cult; seek expert help. Diagnosis is based on the history (IHD increases the likelihood of a ventricular arrhythmia), a 12-lead ECG, and the response (or lack thereof) to certain medications. ECG fi ndings in favour of VT: • +ve or Ωve QRS concordance in all chest leads (ie all +ve (R) or all Ωve (QS)). • QRS >160ms. • Marked left axis deviation, or ‘northwest axis’ (QRS positive in aVR). • AV dissociation (Ps independent of QRSs) or 2:1 or 3:1 Mobitz II heart block. • Fusion beats or capture beats (fi gs 3.32, 3.33). • RSR’ pattern where R is taller than R’. (R’ taller than R suggests RBBB.) Ventricular extrasystoles (ectopics) These are common and can be symptomatic— patients describe palpitations, a thumping sensation, or their heart ‘missing a beat’. The pulse may feel irregular if there are frequent ectopics. On ECG, ventricular ectop- ics are broad QRS complexes; they may be single or occur in patterns: • Bigeminy—ectopic every other beat, see fi g 3.34. ECG machines may disregard the second QRS and so calculate the rate to be half the true value. • Trigeminy—every third
