± muscle spasm (Ca2+). The main cause is anxiety: associated dizziness, chest tightness/pain, palpita tions, and panic. Rare causes: response to metabolic acidosis; brainstem lesions. • Kussmaul respiration is deep, sighing breaths in severe metabolic acidosis (blowing off CO2), eg diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, renal impairment. • Neurogenic hyperventilation is produced by pontine lesions. • The hyperventilation syndrome involves panic attacks associated with hyper- ventilation, palpitations, dizziness, faintness, tinnitus, alarming chest pain/ tightness, perioral and peripheral tingling (plasma Ca2+). Treatment: relaxation techniques and breathing into a paper bag (inspired CO2 corrects the alkalosis). NB: the anxious patient in A&E with hyperventilation and a respiratory alkalosis may actually be presenting with an aspirin overdose (p844). Cheyne–Stokes breathing: Breaths get deeper and deeper, then shallower (±epi- sodic apnoea) in cycles. Causes—brainstem lesions or compression (stroke, ICP). If the cycle is long (eg 3min), the cause may be a long lung-to-brain circulation time (eg in chronic pulmonary oedema or cardiac output). It is enhanced by opioids. Sputum examination Further examination—sputum, temperature charts, O 2 sats, PEFR: Inspect spu- tum and send suspicious sputum for microscopy (Gram stain and auramine/ZN stain, if indicated), culture, and cytology. • Black carbon specks suggests smoking: commonest cause
