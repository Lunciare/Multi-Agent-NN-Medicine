or secondary due to hypoxia (eg high altitudes, chronic lung disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease, heavy smoking) or inappropriately erythropoietin secretion (eg in renal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma). Polycythaemia vera The malignant proliferation of a clone derived from one pluripotent stem cell. A mutation in JAK2 (JAK2 V617F) is present in >95%. The erythroid progenitor off spring are unusual in not needing erythropoietin to avoid apoptosis. There is excess proliferation of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, leading to hy- perviscosity and thrombosis. Commoner if >60yrs old. Presentation: May be asymptomatic and detected on FBC, or present with vague symptoms due to hyperviscosity (p372): headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, visual dis- turbance. Itching after a hot bath, and erythromelalgia, a burning sensation in fi n- gers and toes, are characteristic. Signs: facial plethora and splenomegaly (in 60%). Gout may occur due to urate from RBC turnover. Features of arterial (cardiac, cer- ebral, peri pheral) or venous (DVT, cerebral, hepatic) thrombosis may be present. Investigations: • FBC: RCC, Hb, HCT, PCV, often also WBC and platelets. • B12. • Marrow shows hypercellularity with erythroid hyperplasia. • Cytogenetics as re- quired to diff erentiate from CML. • Serum erythropoietin. • Raised red cell mass on 51Cr studies
