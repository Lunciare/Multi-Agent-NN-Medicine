has three roles in clotting: 1 To bring platelets into contact with exposed subendothelium. 2 To make platelets bind to each other. 3 To bind to factor VIII, protecting it from destruction in the circulation. There are >22 types of vWD; the commonest are: Type I: (60–80%) Levels of of vWF. Symptoms are mild. Autosomal dominant. Type II: (20–30%) Abnormal vWF, with lack of high-molecular-weight multimers. Usu- ally autosomal dominant inheritance. Bleeding tendency varies. There are 4 subtypes. Type III: (1–5%) Undetectable vWF levels (autosomal recessive with gene deletions). vWF antigen is lacking and there is factor VIII. Symptoms can be severe. Signs are of a platelet-type disorder (p344): bruising, epistaxis, menorrhagia, bleeding post-tooth extraction. Tests: APTT, bleeding time, factor VIIIC (clotting activity), vWF Ag; INR and platelets. : Get expert help. Desmopressin is used in mild bleeding, vWF-containing factor VIII concentrate for surgery or major bleeds. Avoid NSAIDS.

Features: • Dysphagia, dys arthria (IX and X nuclei). • Vertigo, nausea, vomiting, nystagmus (vestibular
