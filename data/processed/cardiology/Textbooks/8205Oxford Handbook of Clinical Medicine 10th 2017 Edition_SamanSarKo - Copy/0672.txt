coli, amoebae. Faecal calprotectin: A simple, non-invasive test for GI infl ammation with high sensitivity. AXR: No faecal shadows; mucosal thickening/islands (fi g 16.9, p729); colonic dilata- tion (see ‘Complications’). Lower GI endoscopy: Limited fl exible sigmoidoscopy if acute to assess and biopsy; full colonoscopy once controlled to defi ne disease extent (see p249, fi g 6.10).

Complications Acute: Toxic dilatation of colon (mucosal islands, colonic diameter >6cm) with risk of perforation; venous thromboembolism: give prophylaxis to all in- patients regardless of rectal bleeding (p350); K+ Chronic: Colonic cancer: risk related to disease extent and activity ≈5–10% with pancolitis for 20yrs. Neoplasms may oc- cur in fl at, normal-looking mucosa. To spot precursor areas of dysplasia, surveillance colonoscopy eg 1–5yrs (depending on risk), with multiple random biopsies or biopsies guided by diff
