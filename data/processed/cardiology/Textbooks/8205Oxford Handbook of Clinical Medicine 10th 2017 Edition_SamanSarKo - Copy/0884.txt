old, due to micro- vascular occlusion, leading to susceptibility to infection (40% of childhood sickle deaths are caused this way). • Poor growth. • Chronic renal failure. • Gall- stones. • Retinal disease. • Iron overload (see BOX ‘A 7-year-old ...’). •Lung damage: hypoxiafi brosispulmonary hypertension. Management of chronic disease Get help from a haematologist. • Hydroxycarbamide if frequent crises (production of fetal haemoglobin, HbF). Dose example: 20mg/kg/d if eGFR >60mL/min. • Splenic infarction leads to hyposplenism and immunocompromise. Prophylaxis, in terms of antibiotics and immunization, should be given (p373). • Febrile children risk septicaemia: repeated admission may be avoided by early rescue out-patient antibiotics, eg ceftriaxone (eg 2 doses, 50mg/kg IV on day 0 and 1). Consider admission if Hb <50g/L, WCC <5 or >30 ≈ 109/L, T° >40°C, severe pain, dehydration, lung infi ltration. Seek expert advice. • Bone marrow transplant can be curative but remains controversial. Prevention Genetic counselling; prenatal tests (OHCS pp154–5). Parental education can help prevent 90% of deaths from sequestration crises. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 334400 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH Managing sickle-cell crises 341 • Give prompt, generous analgesia, eg IV opiates (see p574). Most sickle patients will have a personalized analgesia plan—ask them! Seek expert help early.
