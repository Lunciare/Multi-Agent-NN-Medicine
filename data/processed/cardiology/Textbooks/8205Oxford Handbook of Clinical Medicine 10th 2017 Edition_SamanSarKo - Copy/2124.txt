arrest. Treatment: Remove the source. Give 100% O2 until COHb <10%. Metabolic acido- sis usually responds to correction of hypoxia. If severe, anticipate cerebral oedema and give mannitol IVI (p831). Confi rm diagnosis with an ABG quickly as levels may soon return to normal. Monitor ECG. If COHb >20%, patient has neurological or psy- chological features, or cardiovascular impairment, fails to respond to treatment, or is pregnant, consider hyperbaric O2: discuss with the poisons service. Digoxin Symptoms: Cognition, yellow-green visual halos, arrhythmias, nausea, and anorexia. If serious arrhythmias are present, correct hypokalaemia, and inactivate with digoxin-specifi c antibody fragments (DigiFab®). If load or level is unknown, give 20 vials (800mg)—adult or child >20kg. Heavy metals Enlist expert help. Iron Desferrioxamine 15mg/kg/h IVI; max 80mg/kg/d. NB: gastric lavage if iron inges- tion in last hour; consider whole-bowel irrigation. Oral anticoagulants See p351. If major bleed, give vitamin K 5mg slow IV and prothrombin complex concentrate 50U/kg IV (or if unavailable, fresh frozen plasma 15mL/kg IVI). For abnormal INR with no (or minimal) bleeding, see BNF. If it is vital that anticoagulation continues, enlist expert help. Discuss with haematology. NB: coagulation defects may be delayed for 2–3d following ingestion. Opiates (Many analgesics
