main hole is blocked, get anaesthetic assistance! 3 Chest drain not bubbling/swinging: • Is it correctly positioned (see earlier in topic)—if not in the pleural space, it cannot drain the air/fl uid. Common problems include sitting in the soft tissue of the chest wall, or sitting above the eff usion, below the pneumothorax, or in the oblique fi ssure. • Is it blocked? If draining an eff usion and correctly positioned, consider gently fl ushing with 10mL of sterile saline, then aspirating. If not successful, obtain senior advice. • Has the eff usion/pneumothorax resolved? Pneumothoraces can rapidly resolve with a correctly positioned drain. 4 Unable to aspirate from NG tube: • Is NG tube not far enough in/coiled in oesophagus? Tip is radio-opaque and should be visible below the diaphragm, if it is coiled it may lie in the pharynx or anywhere along the mediastinum. • Is NG tube passing down the trachea and into the bronchus? The oesophagus is (generally speaking) a straight vertical line, if the tube veers off to left or right before it goes below the diaphragm, assume it is in the bronchus and replace it. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 772266 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR 727 Fig 16.6 Image from
