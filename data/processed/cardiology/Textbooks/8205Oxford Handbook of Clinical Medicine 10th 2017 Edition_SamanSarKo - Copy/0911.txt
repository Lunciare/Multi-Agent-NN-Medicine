Rivaroxaban, apixaban (factor Xa inhibitors) and dabigatran (a direct thrombin inhibitor) do not require regular monitoring and dose adjustment; just a quarterly assessment and annual blood test. They off er an attractive alternative to warfarin (particularly where monitoring and maintaining a therapeutic INR is diffi cult). CI: severe renal/liver impairment; active bleeding; le- sion at risk of bleeding; clotting factors. Interactions: heparin, clopidogrel. Others Fondaparinux is a pentasaccharide Xa inhibitor and is used in acute coro- nary syndrome or in place of LMWH for prophylaxis. Beginning therapeutic anticoagulation (Follow local guidelines, and see BNF.) For treatment of venous thromboembolism, LMWH or UFH are typically used initially. When transitioning
