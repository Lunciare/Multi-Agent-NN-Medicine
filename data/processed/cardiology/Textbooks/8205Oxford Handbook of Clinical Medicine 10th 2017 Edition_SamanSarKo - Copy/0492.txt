is improved by adopting a stepwise approach, combining an objec- tive probability score, with subsequent investigations, as follows. Assess the clinical probability of a PE: Many systems exist and one of the most frequently used is the modifi ed Wells Criteria (table 4.8). Table 4.8 Modifi ed two-level PE Wells score Feature Score Clinical signs and symptoms of DVT (leg pain and pain on deep palpation 3 of veins) Heart rate >100 beats per minute 1.5 Recently bed-ridden (>3 days) or major surgery (<4 weeks) 1.5 Previous DVT or PE 1.5 Haemoptysis 1 Cancer receiving active treatment , treated in last 6/12, palliative 1 An alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE 3 Score <4 = PE unlikely; score >4 = PE likely Wells PS, Anderson DR, Rodger M, et al. ‘Derivation of a Simple Clinical Model to Categorize Patients Probability of Pulmonary Embolism: Increasing the Models Utility with the SimpliRED D-dimer’.
