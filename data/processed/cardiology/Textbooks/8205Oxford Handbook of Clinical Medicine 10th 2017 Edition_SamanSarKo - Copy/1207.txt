nausea, vomiting ± prostration. No deafness or tinnitus. Causes: virus; vascular lesion. Severe vertigo subsides in days, complete recovery takes 3–4wks. : reassure. Sedate. Ménière’s disease: Increased pressure in the endolymphatic system of the inner ear causes recurrent attacks of vertigo lasting >20min, fl uctuating (or permanent) sen- sorineural hearing loss, and tinnitus (with a sense of aural fullness ± falling to one side). : bed rest and reassurance in acute attacks. An antihistamine (eg cinnarizine) is useful if prolonged, or buccal prochlorperazine if severe, for up to 7d. Ototoxicity: Amino glycosides, loop diuretics, or cisplatin can cause deafness ± vertigo. Acoustic neuroma: (fi gs 10.12, 10.13) Doubly misnamed: it is a Schwannoma (not neuroma) arising from the vestibular (not auditory) nerve. They account for 80% of cerebellopontine angle tumours and often present with unilateral hearing loss, with vertigo occurring later. Growth rate is slow (usually 1–2 mm/year) and can be predicted by serial MRIs. With progression, ipsilateral Vth , VIth , IXth , and Xth nerves may be aff ected (also ipsilateral cerebellar signs). Signs of  ICP occur late, indicating a large tumour. Commoner in  and neurofi bromatosis (esp. NF2, p514). Traumatic damage: If trauma aff ects
