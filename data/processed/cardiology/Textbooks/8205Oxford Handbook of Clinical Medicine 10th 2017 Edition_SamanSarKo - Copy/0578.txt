AXR/CXR: Any past TB, eg upper zone fi brosis or adrenal calcifi cation? If no autoantibodies, con- sider further tests (eg adrenal CT) for TB, histoplasma, or metastatic disease. Treatment See p836 for Addisonian crisis (shocked). Replace steroids: ~15–25mg hydrocortisone daily, in 2 –3 doses, eg 10mg on waking, 5mg lunchtime. Avoid giving late (may cause insomnia).
