Peak incidence: 5–15yrs. Tends to recur unless prevented. Pharyngeal infection with Lancefi eld group A -haemolytic streptococci triggers rheumatic fe- ver 2–4wks later, in the susceptible 2% of the population. An antibody to the car- bohydrate cell wall of the streptococcus cross-reacts with valve tissue (antigenic mimicry) and may cause permanent damage to the heart valves. Diagnosis Use the revised Jones criteria (may be over-rigorous). There must be evidence of recent strep infection plus 2 major criteria, or 1 major + 2 minor. Evidence of group A -haemolytic streptococcal infection: • Positive throat culture (usually negative by the time RF symptoms appear). • Rapid streptococcal antigen test +ve. • Elevated
