daily FBC, U&E, Ca2+, glucose, amylase, ABG. • If worsening: ITU, O2 if PaO2. In suspected abscess formation or pancreatic ne- crosis (on CT), consider parenteral nutrition ± laparotomy & debridement (‘necro- sectomy’). Antibiotics may help in severe disease. • ERCP + gallstone removal may be needed if there is progressive jaundice. • Repeat imaging (usually CT) is performed in order to monitor progress.  Any acute abdomen (p606), myocardial infarct. Early complications Shock, ARDS (p186), renal failure (give lots of fl uid!), DIC, sep- sis, Ca2+, glucose (transient; 5% need insulin). Late complications (>1wk.) Pancreatic necrosis and pseudocyst(fl uid in lesser sac, fi g 13.45), with fever, a mass ± persistent amylase/LFT; may resolve or need drainage. Abscesses need draining. Bleeding from elastase eroding a major ves- sel (eg splenic artery); embolization may be life-saving. Thrombosis may occur in the splenic/gastrod uodenal arteries, or colic branches of the SMA, causing bowel necrosis. Fistulae normally close spontaneously. If purely pancreatic they do not irritate the skin. Some patients suff er recurrent oedematous pancreatitis so often that near-total pancreate ctomy is contemplated. It can all be a miserable course. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 663366 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Modifi ed Glasgow criteria for predicting severity
