(removes AChR antibodies from the circulation) or IVIg and identify and treat the trigger for the relapse (eg infection, medications). Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) LEMS can be paraneoplastic (50% are associated with malignancies, in particular small-cell lung cancer) or autoimmune. Unlike MG, antibodies are to voltage-gated Ca2+ channels on pre-synaptic memb rane (see fi g 10.33; anti-P/Q type VGCC antibodies are +ve in 85–95%). Clinical features •Gait diffi culty before eye signs. •Autonomic involvement (dry mouth, constipation, impotence). •Hyporefl exia and weakness, which improve after exercise. •Dip lo pia and respiratory muscle involvement are rare. •EMG shows similar changes to MG except amplitude increases greatly post-exercise. Treatment Pyridostigmine, 3,4-diaminopyridine or IVIg (get specialist help). Do regular CXR/high-resolution CT as symptoms may precede the cancer by >4yrs. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 551122 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN How synapses work—the neuromuscular junction 513 1 Before transmission can occur, neurotransmitter must be packed into synaptic vesicles. At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) this is acetylcholine (ACh). Each vesicle contains ~8000 ACh molecules. 2 When an action potential arrives at the pre-synaptic terminal, depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCS). In Lambert–Eaton syndrome, anti- P/Q type VGCC antibodies disrupt this stage of synaptic transmission.15 3 Infl ux of Ca2+ through
