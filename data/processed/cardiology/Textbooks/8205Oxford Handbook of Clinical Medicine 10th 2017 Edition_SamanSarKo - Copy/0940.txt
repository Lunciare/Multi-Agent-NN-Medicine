lymphoma causes sore throat/obstructed breathing. Other possible sites: Bone, CNS, and lung. • Systemic features—fever, night sweats, weight loss (less common than in Hodg- kin’s lymphoma, and indicates disseminated disease). • Pancytopenia from marrow involvement—anaemia, infection, bleeding (platelets). Tests Blood: FBC, U&E, LFT. LDH ≈ worse prognosis, refl ecting cell turnover. Marrow and node biopsy for classifi cation (complex, based on the WHO system of high- or low-grade). Staging: Ann Arbor system (p360)—CT ± PET of chest, abdomen, pelvis. Send cytology of any eff usion; LP for CSF cytology if CNS signs. Diagnosis/management is multidisciplinary, synthesizing details from clinical evaluation, histology, immunology, molecular genetics, and imaging. Generally: • Low-grade lymphomas are indolent, often incurable and widely disseminated. In- clude: follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma/MALT, lymphocytic lympho- ma (closely related to CLL and treated similarly), lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma (produces IgM = Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia, p370). See fi g 8.63. • High-grade lymphomas are more aggressive, but often curable. There is often rapidly enlarging lymphadenopathy with systemic symptoms. Include: Burkitt’s lymphoma (childhood disease with characteristic jaw lymphadenopathy; fi gs 8.64, 8.65), lymphoblastic lymphomas (like ALL), diff use large B-cell lymphoma. Treatment Huge range of options, depending on disease subtype. Low grade: If symptomless, none
