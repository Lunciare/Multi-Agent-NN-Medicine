Anti-anginal drugs p116. Antihypertensives p140. Drugs that slow conduction through the atrioventricular node Drugs that slow conduction through the atrioventricular node (AVN) include di- goxin, verapamil, and adenosine. Uses include cardioverting AVNRT and diagnos- ing atrial tachycardias. Drugs that slow AVN conduction should be avoided in patients with aberrant pathways (eg WPW) as blocking the AVN can increase conduction via the alterna- tive pathways. AVN blockers are contraindicated in patients with or at risk of VT, eg those with long QT syndrome. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 111155 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 116 Angina pectoris If ACS is a possible diagnosis (including unstable angina), see pp798–801.
