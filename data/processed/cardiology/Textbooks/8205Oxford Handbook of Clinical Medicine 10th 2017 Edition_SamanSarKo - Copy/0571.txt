from an ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma (usually a microadenoma, p234). :>1:1. Peak age: 30–50yrs. A low- dose dexamethasone test (BOX) leads to no change in plasma cortisol, but 8mg may be enough to more than halve morning cortisol (as occurs in normals). • Ectopic ACTH production: Especially small cell lung cancer and carcinoid tum- ours, p271. Specifi c features: pigmentation (due to ACTH), hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis (cortisol leads to mineralocorticoid activity), weight loss, hyperg lycaemia. Classical features of Cushing’s are often absent. Dexamethasone even in high doses (8mg) fails to suppress cortisol production. • Rarely, ectopic CRF production: Some thyroid (medullary) and prostate cancers. 2 ACTH-independent causes (ACTH due to Ωve feedback) • Iatrogenic: Pharmacological doses of steroids (common). • Adrenal adenoma/cancer: (May cause abdo pain ± virilization in , p230.) Because the tumour is autonomous, dexamethasone in any dose won’t suppress cortisol. • Adrenal nodular hyperplasia: (As for adrenal adenoma, no dexamethasone sup- pression.) • Rarely: Carney complex, p223. McCune–Albright syndrome, see OHCS p650. Symptoms Weight; mood change (depression, lethargy, irritability, psychosis); proximal weakness; gonadal dysfunction (irregular menses; hirsuti sm; erectile dys- function); acne; recurrent Achilles tendon rupture; occasionally virilization if . Signs Central obesity; plethoric, moon face; buff alo
