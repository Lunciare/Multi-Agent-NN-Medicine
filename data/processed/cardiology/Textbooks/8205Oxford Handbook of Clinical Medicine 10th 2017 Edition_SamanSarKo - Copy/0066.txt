Can you fi nd a sample size calculation? Watch out for sub-group analyses for which the sample size was not calculated. • Were outcome measures predefi ned? • Is randomization adequate? Look at the baseline data for each group—are there signifi cant diff erences? Are any parameters of interest (that might aff ect out- come) not included? • Who was blinded and how blind were they? • Are statistical methods reported and appropriate?

Watch out for surrogate end-points which do not directly measure benefi t, harm, or the treatment response of interest. • How long was the follow-up? Was it long enough to determine outcome? • How
