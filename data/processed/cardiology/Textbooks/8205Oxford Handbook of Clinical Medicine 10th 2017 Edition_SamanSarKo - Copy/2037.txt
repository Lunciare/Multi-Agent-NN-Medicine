stratifi cation can help predict those most at risk and allow interven- tion to be targeted at those individuals: calculate using GRACE score.2 The following are associated with an increased risk: • History of unstable angina. • ST depression or widespread T-wave inversion. • Raised troponin (except patients with ST elevation MI). • Age >70 years. • General comorbidity, previous MI, poor LV function or DM. High-risk patients should be considered for inpatient coronary angiography. Symp- tomatic lesions may be addressed by coronary stenting or CABG (see p123). Further measures • Wean off glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) infusion when stabilized on oral drugs. • Continue fondaparinux (or LMWH or heparin) until discharge. • Observe on cardiac monitor or telemetry in case of dysrhythmia. Check serial ECGS, and troponin >12h after pain. • Address modifi able risk factors: smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes. • Gentle mobilization. • Ensure patient on dual antiplatelet therapy, -blocker, ACE inhibitor, and statin. If symptoms recur, refer to cardiologist for urgent angiography & PCI or CABG. 2 GRACE = Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events. Risk is scored based on age, heart rate, BP, re- nal function, Killip class of heart failure, and other events, eg raised troponin.
