Avoid in pregnancy, children, type 1 DM, and haemoglobi- nopathies. Whenever you have a needle in a vein, do a blood glucose (unless recently done); note if fasting or not. Non-systematic, but better than urine tests (false Ωves). Diff erentiating type 1 and 2 diabetes Occasionally it may be diffi cult to diff erentiate whether a patient has type 1 or 2 DM, although they can present diff erently (see table 5.1). Features of type 1 include weight loss; persistent hyper glycaemia despite diet and medications; presence of autoantibodies: islet cell antibodies (ICA) and anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) antibodies; ketonuria.
