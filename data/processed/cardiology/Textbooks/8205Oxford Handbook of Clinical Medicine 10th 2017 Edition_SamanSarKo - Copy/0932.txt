ygolotameaH Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) 359 CLL is the commonest leukaemia (>25%; incidence: ~5/100 000/yr). :≈2:1. The hall- mark is progressive accumulation of a malignant clone of functionally incompetent B cells. Mutations, trisomies, and deletions (eg del17p13) infl uence risk (table 8.8). Table 8.8 Staging and survival in CLL Rai stage: 0 Lymphocytosis alone Median survival >13yrs I Lymphocytosis + lymphadenopathy 8yrs II Lymphocytosis + spleno- or hepatomegaly 5yrs III Lymphocytosis + anaemia (Hb <110g/L) 2yrs IV Lymphocytosis + platelets <100 ≈ 109/L 1yr Symptoms Often none, presenting as a surprise fi nding on a routine FBC. Patients may be anaemic or infection-prone, or have weight, sweats, anorexia if severe. Signs Enlarged, rubbery, non-tender nodes (fi g 8.56). Splenomegaly, hepatomegaly. Tests Lymphocytes—may be marked (fi g 8.57). Later: autoimmune haemolysis (p338), marrow infi ltration: Hb, neutrophils, platelets. Complications 1 Autoimmune haemolysis. 2 Infection due to hypogammaglobuli- naemia (=IgG), bacterial, viral especially herpes zoster. 3 Marrow failure. Treatment Consider drugs if symptomatic. Fludarabine + rituximab ± cyclophos- phamide is 1st line (there is synergism). Ibrutinib, chlorambucil, bendamustine, and ofatumumab all have a role.Steroids help autoimmune haemolysis. Radiotherapy helps lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Stem-cell transplantation may have a role in carefully selected patients.
