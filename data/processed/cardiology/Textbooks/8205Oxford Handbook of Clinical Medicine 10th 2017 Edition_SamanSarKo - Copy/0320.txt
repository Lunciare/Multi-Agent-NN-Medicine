troponin in the blood can therefore help with diagnosing myocardial damage. Troponins I and T are most specifi c to the heart. Troponin levels are most commonly measured when ACS is suspected. In this circumstance, one would expect troponin levels to rise in the hours following the insult (fi g 3.22). Troponin levels can be high with other causes of myocardial dam- age, for example myocarditis, pericarditis, and ventricular strain. With these con- ditions, the troponin levels are likely to change little hour by hour as the insults are ongoing. Discrete episodes of tachyarrhythmias may cause troponin rises similar to in ACS. Troponin levels can also be raised iatrogenically, eg following CPR, DC cardioversion, ablation therapy. A troponin rise may have a non-cardiac aetiology. This can be indirectly related to the heart, eg a massive PE causing right ventricular strain, or have no clear car- diac connection, eg subarachnoid haemorrhage, burns, or sepsis. A common cause of consistently elevated troponin is renal failure. Hence, when measuring troponin, change in level is often more important than the level itself.
