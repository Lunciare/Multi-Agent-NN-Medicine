scatter, slowing, or other alterations by various tissues. Nuclear medicine is the opposite; it measures emitted radiation from an internal source, introduced into the patient via injection, inhala- tion, or ingestion. It can be diagnostic (eg PET scanning) or therapeutic (eg radio- iodine (I131) ablation in thyrotoxicosis). Because molecules labelled with radioisotopes are introduced into the patient, there is exposure to ionizing radiation, though doses are usually less than those from CT (see table 16.1, p719). The selection of molecule for labelling depends on the tissue of interest, as it should be something that will be readily taken up by that tissue, eg bisphosphonates for bone, glucose for fast-turnover tissue. Examples include: Ventilation/perfusion (VQ) scan Uses inhaled technetium (Tc) or, less commonly, xenon-133 (133Xe) plus injected 99mTc macro-aggregates, which lodge in lung capillar- ies. Normal perfusion excludes PE but ventilation component requires a normal CXR for comparison (fi gs 16.25, 16.26). Due to the large number of ‘indeterminate’ scans VQ is considered inferior to CTPA for the investigation of PE except in pregnancy (see p192). Fig 16.25 Ventilation scintigram.
