Lamotrigine is not thought to be harmful to infants. • Discuss contraceptive methods, bearing in mind that: enzyme-inducing AEDS make progesterone-only contraception unreliable, and oestrogen-containing contraceptives lower lamotrigine levels—an increased dose may be needed to achieve seizure control. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 449933 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 494 Parkinsonism This is the extrapyramidal triad of: 1 Tremor. Worse at rest; often ‘pill-rolling’ of thumb over fi ngers (see p468). 2 Hypertonia. Rigidity + tremor gives ‘cogwheel rigidity’, felt by the examiner during rapid pronation/supination. 3 Bradykinesia. Slow to initiate movement; actions slow and de- crease in amplitude with repetition, eg  blink rate, micrographia. Gait is festinant (shuffl ing, pitched forward, fi g 10.25) with  arm- swing and freezing at obstacles or doors (due to poor simulta- neous motor and cognitive function). Expressionless face.
