Use their expertise. Assessment of pain Pain is one of the most feared sequelae of a terminal diagnosis and yet it is not inevitable. However, pain is a complex phenomenon. While the aim of management is for the patient to be pain free, this may not be achievable in all cases so do not promise this. Do not assume a cause: detailed history and examination are needed to under- stand aetiology, which will guide subsequent treatment, eg pain from nerve infi l- tration or local pressure may respond better to agents other than opioids. History and examination are essential for all patients, including those at the end of life. Evaluate severity, nature, functional defi cit, and psychological state as all of these contribute to the symptom burden. Management of pain Aim to modify the underlying pathology where possible, eg radiotherapy, chemo- therapy, surgery. Use analgesia to relieve background pain and provide additional PRN doses for ‘breakthrough’ pain. Eff ective analgesia is possible in the majority of patients by combining fi ve principles: 1 By the mouth—give orally whenever possible. 2 By the clock—give at fi xed intervals to off er continuous relief. 3 By the ladder—following the WHO stepwise approach
