been known to exist in the atria, and if hom ogenized atrial tissue is injected into rats, their urine volume (and Na+ excretion) rises; this is because of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). BNP is a similar hormone originally identifi ed from pig brain (hence the B), but most BNP is secreted from ventricular myocardium. Plasma BNP is closely related to LV pressure and in MI and LV dys- function, these hormones can be released in large quantities. Secretion is also increased by tachycardia, glucocorticoids, and thyroid hormones. Role: ANP and BNP assist the stretched atria and ventricles by increasing GFR and decreasing renal Na+ resorption, thereby reducing fl uid load; and by relaxing smooth muscle, thereby decreasing preload. BNP as a biomarker of heart failure: BNP distinguishes heart failure from other causes of dyspnoea more accurately than other biomarkers and LV ejection frac- tion (sensitivity: >90%; specifi city: 80–90%). The rises are greater with left than right heart failure and with systolic than diastolic dysfunction. What BNP threshold for diagnosing heart failure: If BNP >100ng/L, this ‘diag- noses’ heart failure better than other clinical variables or clinical judgement (his- tory, examination, and CXR). BNP can be used to ‘rule out’
