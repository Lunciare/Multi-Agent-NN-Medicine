Direct hernias push their way directly forward through the posterior wall of the inguinal canal, into a defect in the abdominal wall (Hes- selbach’s triangle; medial to the inferior epigastric vessels and lateral to the rectus abdominus). Predisposing conditions: males (:≈8:1), chronic cough, constipation, urinary obstruction, heavy lifting, ascites, past abdominal surgery (eg damage to the iliohypogastric nerve during appendicectomy). There are two landmarks to identify: the deep (internal) ring may be defi ned as being the mid-point of the inguinal liga- ment, ~1½ cm above the femoral pulse (which crosses the mid-inguinal point); the superfi cial (external) ring is a split in the external oblique aponeurosis just superior and medial to the pubic tubercle (the bony prominence forming the medial attach- ment of the inguinal ligament). Examination Look for previous scars; feel the other side (more common on the right); examine the external genitalia. Then ask: •Is the lump visible? If so, ask the patient to reduce it—if he cannot, make sure that it is not a scrotal lump. Ask him to cough. Appears
