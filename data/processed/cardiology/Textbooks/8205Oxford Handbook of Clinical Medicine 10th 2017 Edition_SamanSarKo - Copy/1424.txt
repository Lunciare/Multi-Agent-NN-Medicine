predictors. Be mindful of the impact of disease on relationships, work, and hobbies and acknowledge and explore this with your patients. Patients may wish to investigate complementary therapies and may fi nd benefi t from support groups . Infl uencing biological events in RA The chief biological event is infl ammation. Over-produced cytokines and cellular processes erode cartilage and bone, and produce the systemic eff ects seen in RA. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDS) are 1st line and should ideally be started within 3 months of persistent symptoms. They can take 6–12 weeks for symptomatic benefi t. Best results are often achieved with a combination of meth- otrexate, sulfasalazine, and hydroxychloroquine.23 Lefl unomide is another option. Immunosuppression is a potentially fatal SE of treatment (especially in combi- nation with methotrexate) which can result in pancytopenia, susceptibility to infection (including atypical organisms), and neutropenic sepsis (p352). Regular FBC, LFT monitoring.24 Other SE • Methotrexate—pneumonitis (pre treatment CXR), oral ulcers, hepa- totoxicity, teratogenic. • Sulfasalazine—rash, sperm count, oral ulcers, GI upset. • Lefl unomide—teratogenicity ( and ), oral ulcers, BP, hepatotoxicity. • Hydroxy- chloroquine—can cause retinopathy; pre treatment and annual eye screen required.
