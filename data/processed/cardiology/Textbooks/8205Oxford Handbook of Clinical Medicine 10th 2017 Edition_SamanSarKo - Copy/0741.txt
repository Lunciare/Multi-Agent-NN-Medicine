Urine: 24h copper excretion is high, eg >100mcg/24h (normal <40mcg). 2 LFT: non-specifi c (but ALT >1500 is not part of the picture). 3 Serum copper: typically <11μmol/L. 4 Serum caeruloplasmin: <200mg/L (<140mg/L is pathognomonic)—beware incidental low values in protein-defi ciency states (eg nephrotic syndrome, mal- absorption). 5 Molecular genetic testing can confi rm the diagnosis. 6 Slit lamp exam: KF rings: in iris/Descemet’s membrane (fi g 5.42 OHCS p452). 7 Liver biopsy: Hepatic copper (copper >250mcg/g dry weight); hepatitis; cirrhosis. 8 MRI: degeneration in basal ganglia, fronto-temporal, cerebellar, and brainstem. Management Diet: Avoid foods with high copper content (eg liver, chocolate, nuts, mushrooms, legumes, and shellfi sh). Check water sources (eg wells, pipes) for cop- per. Drugs: Lifelong penicillamine (500mg/6–8h PO for 1yr, maintena nce 0.75–1g/d). SES: nausea, rash, WCC, Hb, platelets, haematuria, nephrosis, lupus. Monitor FBC and urinary copper and protein excretion. Liver transplantation: (See p277.) If severe liver disease. Screen siblings: Asympto matic homozygotes need treating. Prognosis Pre-cirrhotic liver disease is reversible; CNS damage less so. There are no clear clinical prognostic indicators. Fatal events: liver failure, bleeding, infection. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 228855 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG 286 Liver tumours The commonest (90%) liver tumours are metastases (see fi g
