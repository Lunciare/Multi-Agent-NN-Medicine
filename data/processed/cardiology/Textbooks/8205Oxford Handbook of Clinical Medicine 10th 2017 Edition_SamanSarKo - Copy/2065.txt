purulent. • Blood cultures if pyrexial. Management Ensure oxygenation then treat the reversible,8 see fi g 19.13. • Look for a cause, eg infection, pneumothorax. • Prior to discharge, liaise with GP regarding steroid reduction, domiciliary oxygen (p184), smoking cessation, and pneumococcal and fl u vaccinations (p166). Treatment of stable COPD and more advanced disease: See pp184–5. Consider the ceiling of care: What is in the best interests of the patient? Invasive ventilation for exacerbations of COPD may not be appropriate: it can be diffi cult to wean patients off ventilatory support, and brings with it the risk of ventilator-asso- ciated pneumonias and pneumothoraces from ruptured bullae. If possible, speak to the patient early, before deterioration, try to ascertain their wishes. Patients who have previously been ventilated may not wish to repeat the experience. Consider comorbidities, FEV1, functional status, whether the patient requires home oxygen, and whether the patient has previously been admitted to ICU (and if so, whether they were easily weaned from invasive ventilation). Involve the patient, the family, your seniors, and ICU early in making a decision. Oxygen therapy • The greatest danger is hypoxia, which probably accounts for more deaths than hypercapnia. Don’t leave patients severely
