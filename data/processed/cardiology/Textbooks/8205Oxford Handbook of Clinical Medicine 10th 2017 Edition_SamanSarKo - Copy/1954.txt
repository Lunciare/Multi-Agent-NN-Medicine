If the patient still needs a catheter then replace it, consider a larger size. • The catheter has perforated the lower urinary tract on insertion and is not lying in the bladder or urethra: If suspected, call the urologists immediately. Remember: urine output should be >400mL in 24h or >0.5mL/kg/h (see p576). Trial without catheter (TWOC) When it is time to remove a catheter, the possibility of urinary retention must be considered. Remove the catheter fi rst thing one morning. If retention does occur, insert a long-term catheter (eg silicone), consider an -blocker (p642), and arrange urology TWOC clinic follow-up. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 776633 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 serudecorp lacitcarP 764 Draining ascites For patients with refractory or recurrent ascites that is symptomatic, it is possible to drain the ascites using a long pig-tail catheter. Paracentesis in such patients even in the presence of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis may be safe. Learn at the bedside from an expert. Contraindications (these are relative, not absolute) End-stage cirrhosis; co- agulopathy; hyponatraemia (126mmol/L); sepsis. The main complication of the procedure is severe hypovolaemia secondary to reaccumulation of the ascites, so intravascular replenishment with a plasma expander is required. For smaller vol- umes, eg less
