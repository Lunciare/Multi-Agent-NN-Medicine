Reproduced with permission from World Health Organization, Global tuberculosis report 2016. © World Health Organization 2016. Pathophysiology Caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Active infection occurs when containment by the immune system (T-cells/mac- rophages) is inadequate. It can arise from primary infection, or re-activation of previously latent disease. Transmission of TB is via inhalation of aerosol droplets containing bacterium. This means only pulmonary disease is communicable. Latent TB is infection without disease due to persistent immune system containment (ie granuloma formation prevents bacteria growth and spread). Positive skin/blood testing (p394) shows evidence of infection but the patient is asymptomatic and non- infectious (normal sputum/CXR). ~2 billion persons worldwide (~⅓ of world’s popula- tion) are estimated to have latent TB. Lifetime risk of reactivation is 5–10%. Risk factors for reactivation: new infection (<2y), HIV, organ transplantation, immunosup- pression (including corticosteroids), silicosis, illicit drug use, malnutrition, high-risk settings (homeless shelter, prison), low socio-economic status, haemodialysis. Presentation TB, or not TB—that is the question. Maintain a high index of suspicion. TB can aff ect any organ in the body (table 9.9). Table 9.9 UK TB case reports by
