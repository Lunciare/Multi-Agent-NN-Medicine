antigen. Treatment: amoxicillin, benzylpenicillin, or cephalosporin. Staphylococcal pneumonia May complicate infl uenza infection or occur in the young, elderly, intravenous drug users, or patients with underlying disease, eg leu- kaemia, lymphoma, cystic fi brosis (CF). It causes a bilateral cavitating bronchopneu- monia. Treatment: fl ucloxacillin ± rifampicin, MRSA: contact lab; consider vancomycin. Klebsiella pneumonia Rare. Occurs in elderly, diabetics, and alcoholics. Causes a cavitating pneumonia, particularly of the upper lobes, often drug resistant. Treat- ment: cefotaxime or imipenem. Pseudomonas A common pathogen in bronchiectasis and CF. It also causes hospital-acquired infections, particularly on ITU or after surgery. Treatment: anti- pseudomonal penicillin, ceftazidime, meropenem, or ciprofl oxacin + aminoglycoside. Consider dual therapy to minimize resistance. Mycoplasma pneumoniae Occurs in epidemics about every 4yrs. It presents in- sidiously with fl u-like symptoms (headache, myalgia, arthralgia) followed by a dry cough. CXR: reticular-nodular shadowing or patchy consolidation often of one lower lobe, and worse than signs suggest. Diagnosis: PCR sputum or serology. Cold aggluti- nins may cause an autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. Complications: Skin rash (ery- thema multiforme, fi g 12.22, p563), Stevens–Johnson syndrome, meningoe ncephalitis or myelitis; Guillain–Barré syndrome. Treatment: Clarithromycin (500mg/12h) or doxycycline (200mg loading then 100mg OD) or a fl uroquinolone
