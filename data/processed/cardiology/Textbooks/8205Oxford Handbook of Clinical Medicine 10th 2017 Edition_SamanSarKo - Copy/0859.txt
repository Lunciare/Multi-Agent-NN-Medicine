eg with infection or burns, and also in leukaemia. Pappenheimer bodies: (fi g 8.16) Granules of siderocytes containing iron. Seen in lead poisoning, carcinomatosis, and post-splenectomy. Poikilocytosis: Variation in RBC shape, eg in IDA, myelofi brosis, thalassaemia. Polychromasia: RBCS of diff erent ages stain unevenly (young are bluer). This is a re- sponse to bleeding, haematinic replacement (ferrous sulfate, B12, folate), haemolysis, or marrow infi ltration. Reticulocyte count is raised. Reticulocytes: (Normal range: 0.8–2%; or <85≈109/L.) (fi g 8.17) Young, larger RBCS (contain RNA) signifying active erythropoiesis. Increased in haemolysis, haemor- rhage, and if B12, iron, or folate is given to marrow that lack these. Right shift: Hypermature white cells: hypersegmented polymorphs (>5 lobes to nu- cleus) seen in megaloblastic anaemia, uraemia, and liver disease. See p333, fi g 8.25. Rouleaux formation: (fi g 8.18) Red cells stack on each other (causing a raised ESR; p372). Seen with chronic infl ammation, paraproteinaemia, and myeloma. Schisto cytes: Fragmented RBCS sliced by fi brin bands, in intravascular haemolysis (p339, fi g 8.31). Look for microangiopathic anaemia, eg DIC (p352), haemolytic urae- mic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP: p315), or pre-eclampsia. Spherocytes: Spherical cells found in hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. See
