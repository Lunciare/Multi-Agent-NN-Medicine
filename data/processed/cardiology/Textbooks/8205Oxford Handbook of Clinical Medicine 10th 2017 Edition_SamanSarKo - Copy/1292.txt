worse on waking, lying down, bending forward, or with coughing (p456); vomiting; papilloedema (only in 50% of tumours); GCS. • Seizures: Seen in ≤50%. Exclude SOL in all adult-onset seizures, especially if focal, or with a localizing aura or post-ictal weakness (Todd’s palsy, p712). • Evolving focal neurology: See BOX for localizing signs. ICP causes false localizing signs: VIth nerve palsy is commonest (p70) due to its long intracranial course. • Subtle personality change: Irritability, lack of application to tasks, lack of initia- tive, socially inappropriate behaviour. Causes Tumour (primary or metastatic, later in topic), aneurysm, abscess (25% multiple); chronic subdural haematoma, granuloma (p197, eg tuberculoma), cyst (eg cysticercosis). Tumours: 30% are metastatic (eg breast, lung, melanoma). Prima- ries: astrocytoma, glioblastoma multiforme, oligo dendro glioma, ependymoma. Also meningioma, primary CNS lymphoma (eg as non-infectious manifestation of HIV), and cerebellar haemangiob lastoma. Diff erentials Stroke, head injury, venous sinus thrombosis, vasculitis, MS, encephali- tis, post-ictal, metabolic, or idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Tests CT ± MRI (good for posterior fossa masses). Consider biopsy. Avoid LP before imaging (risks coning, ie cerebellar tonsils herniate through the foramen magnum). Tumour management Benign: Remove if possible but some may be inaccessi- ble. Malignant: Excision of gliomas
