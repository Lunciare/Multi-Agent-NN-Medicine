What else could be clouding consciousness? Hypoglycaemia; sepsis; trauma; postictal. What is hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)? Cirrhosis + ascites + renal failure ≈ HRS—if other causes of renal impairment have been excluded. Abnormal haemodynamics causes splanchnic and systemic vaso dilation, but renal vasoconstriction. Bacterial translocation, cytokines, and mesenteric angiogenesis cause splanchnic vasodilation, and altered renal auto- regulation is involved in the renal vasoconstriction. Types of HRS: HRS 1 is a rapidly progressive deterioration in circulatory and renal function (median survival <2wks), often triggered by other deteriorating patholo- gies. Terlipressin resists hypovolaemia. Haemodialysis may be needed. HRS 2 is a more steady deterioration (survival ~6 months). Transjugular intrahepatic porto- systemic stent shunting may be required (TIPS, p257). Other factors in cirrhosis may contribute to poor renal function (p277). Transplants: Liver transplant may be required. After >8–12wks of pre-transplant dialysis, some may be considered for combined liver–kidney transplantation. King’s College Hospital criteria in acute liver failure Paracetamol-induced liver failure Non-paracetamol liver failure • Arterial pH <7.3 24h after ingestion. • PT >100s. Or all of the following: Or 3 out of 5 of the following: • Prothrombin time (PT) >100s 1 Drug-induced liver failure • Creatinine >300μmol/L 2 Age< 10 or >40yrs old
