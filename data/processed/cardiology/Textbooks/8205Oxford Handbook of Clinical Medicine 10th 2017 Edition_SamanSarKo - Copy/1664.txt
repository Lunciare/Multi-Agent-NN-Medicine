With idiopathic RPF there is an associ- ated infl ammatory response resulting in fi brinoid necrosis of the vasa vasorum, aff ecting the aorta and small and medium retroperitoneal vessels. The ureters get embedded in dense, fi brous tissue resulting in progressive bilateral ureteric ob- struction. Secondary causes of RPF include malignancy, typically lymphoma.
