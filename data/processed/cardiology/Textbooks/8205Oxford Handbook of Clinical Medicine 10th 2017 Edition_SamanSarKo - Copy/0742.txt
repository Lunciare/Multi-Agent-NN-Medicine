Primary hepatic tumours are much less common and may be benign or malignant (see table 6.13). Symptoms Fever, malaise, anorexia, weight, RUQ pain ( liver capsule stretch). Jaundice is late, except with cholangiocarcinoma. Benign tumours are often asymptomatic. Tumours may rupture causing intraperitoneal haemorrhage. Signs Hepatomegaly (smooth, or hard and irregular, eg metastases, cirrhosis, HCC). Look for signs of chronic liver disease (p276) and evidence of decompensation (jaun- dice, ascites). Feel for an abdominal mass. Listen for a bruit over the liver (HCC). Tests Blood: FBC, clotting, LFT, hepatitis serology, -fetoprotein ( in 50–80% of HCC, though levels do not correlate with size, stage, or prognosis). Imaging: US or CT to identify lesions and guide biopsy. MRI is better at distinguishing benign from ma- lignant lesions. Do ERCP (p742) and biopsy if cholangiocarcinoma is suspected. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) May achieve a histological diagnosis; careful multidisciplinary discussion is required if potentially resectable, as bleeding or seeding along the
