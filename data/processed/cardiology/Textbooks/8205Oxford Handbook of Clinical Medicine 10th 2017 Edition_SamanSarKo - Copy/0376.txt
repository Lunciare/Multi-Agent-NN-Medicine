ACE-i/ARB, she is a woman of child-bearing potential, or there is sympathetic drive. Combination : ACE-i + Ca2+-channel antagonist or diuretic is logical, and has been commonly used in trials. There is little evidence on using 3 drugs but current recom- mendation is ACE-i, Ca2+-channel antagonist, and thiazide.44 If BP still uncontrolled on adequate doses of 3 drugs, add a 4th—consider: spironolactone 25–50mg/24h or higher-dose thiazide, but monitor U&E. Alternatively, -blocker, or selective -blocker and get help. Check compliance (urinary drug screen, or observed ). Drug examples Thiazides: Eg chlortalidone 25–50mg/24h PO mané. SE: K+, Na+, impotence. CI: gout. Ca2+-channel antagonists: Eg nifedipine MR, 30–60mg/24h PO. SE: fl ushes, fatigue, gum hyperplasia, ankle oedema; avoid short-acting form. ACE-i: Eg lisinopril 10–40mg/24h PO (max 40mg/d). ACE-i may be 1st choice if co-existing LVF, or in diabetics (esp. if microalbuminuria, p314) or proteinuria. SE: cough, K+, renal failure, angio-oedema. CI: bilateral renal artery or aortic valve stenosis; p114. ARB: Candesartan (8–32mg/d); caution if valve disease or cardiomyopathy; monitor K+. SE: vertigo, urticaria, pruritus. Useful if ACE-i induces cough. -blockers: Eg biso- prolol 2.5–5mg/24h PO. SE: bronchospasm, heart failure, cold peripheries, lethargy, impotence. CI: asthma; caution in heart failure. Consider aspirin when BP
