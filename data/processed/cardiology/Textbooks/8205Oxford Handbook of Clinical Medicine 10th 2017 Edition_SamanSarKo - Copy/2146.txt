re-expansion of compressed trapped gas—bowel perforation, fatal air embolism. 2 Blast wind: This can totally disrupt a body or cause avulsive amputations. Bod- ies can be thrown and sustain injuries on landing. 3 Missiles: Penetration or laceration from missiles are by far the commonest injuries. Missiles arise from the bomb or are secondary, eg glass. 4 Flash burns: These are usually superfi cial and occur on exposed skin. 5 Crush injuries: Beware sudden death or acute kidney injury from rhabdomy- olysis after release. 6 Contamination: There is increasing concern about the use of biological or radi- oactive material in terrorist bombs. Even domestic or industrial blasts can scat- ter chemicals widely and cause both superfi cial and penetrating contamination. Consider the location and mechanism of the blast, and seek advice. 7 Psychological injury: Eg post-traumatic stress disorder (OHCS p353). Treatment: Approach the same as any major trauma (OHCS p778). Rest and observe any suspected of exposure to signifi cant blast but without other injury. Gun-shot injury: see OHCS p789. Major blast injuries, whatever the cause, should be reported to the police for investigation.
