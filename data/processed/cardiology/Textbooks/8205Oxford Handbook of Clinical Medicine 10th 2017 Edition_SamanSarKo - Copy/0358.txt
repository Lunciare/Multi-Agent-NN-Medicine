Ejection fraction (EF) is <40%. Causes: IHD, MI, cardiomyopathy. Diastolic failure: Inability of the ventricle to relax and fi ll normally, causing fi lling pressures. Typically EF is >50%, this is termed HFpEF (heart failure with preserved EF). Causes: ventricular hypertrophy, constrictive pericarditis, tamponade, restric- tive cardio myopathy, obesity. NB: systolic and diastolic failure pathophysiology often coexists. Left ventricular failure (LVF): Symptoms: dyspnoea, poor exercise tolerance, fa- tigue, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea (PND), nocturnal cough (± pink frothy sputum), wheeze (cardiac ‘asthma’), nocturia, cold peripheries, weight loss. Right ventricular failure (RVF): Causes: LVF, pulmonary stenosis, lung disease (cor pulmonale, see p194). Symptoms: peripheral oedema (up to thighs, sacrum, abdomi- nal wall), ascites, nausea, anorexia, facial engorgem ent, epistaxis. LVF and RVF may occur independently, or together as congestive cardiac failure (CCF). Acute heart failure: Often used exclusively to mean new-onset acute or decom- pensation of chronic heart failure characterized by pulmonary and/or peripheral oedema with
