also a feature. Treatment is with salt replacement and the use of NSAIDs (after volume repletion). Diuretics Loop diuretics (eg furosemide, bumetanide): Block the Na+/K+/2ClΩ co-trans- porter in the thick ascending loop of Henle, hence increase the solute load of the fi ltrate and reduce water resorption. Increase excretion of water, Na+, ClΩ, phos- phate, Mg2+, Ca2+, K+, and H+. They are readily absorbed from the GI tract (unless it is oedematous in which case IV may be needed) with peak concentration within 30–120min. Widely used in peripheral oedema (heart failure, ascites). They can also be used to treat hypercalcaemia. Side eff ects include hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis, hypovolaemia, and ototoxicity. Distal tubule Physiology Reabsorbs Na+ (~5–10%) and other electrolytes. Key transport via NaCl co- transporter. Pathology Gitelman syndrome: Loss of function of the NaCl co-transporter. Milder than Bar- tter syndrome: usually presents in adolescence/adulthood with incidental fi nding of electrolyte abnormalities. Mimics thiazide diuretic administration. Treat with electrolyte supplementation. Diuretics Thiazide (eg bendrofl umethiazide) and thiazide-like diuretics (eg indapam- ide, chlortalidone, metolazone): Inhibit the NaCl transporter  decrease NaCl reabsorption and increase water loss. Used to treat BP (p140). Side eff ects: hy- ponatraemia, hypokalaemia, and hypomagnesaemia. However, calcium excretion
