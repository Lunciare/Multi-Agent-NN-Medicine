It is better than MRI at showing acute haemorrhage and fractures, and is much easier to do in ill or anaesthetized patients, and so is good in emergencies. The attenuation of biological soft tissues is in a nar- row range from about +80 for blood and muscle, to 0 for CSF, and down to Ω100 for fat (Hounsfi eld units, p730). IV contrast medium initially gives an angiographic eff ect, whitening the vessels. Later, if there is a defect in the blood–brain barrier (eg tumours or infection), contrast medium will opacify a lesion’s margins, giving enhancing white areas. • Some CNS areas, eg pituitary gland, choroid plexus, have no blood–brain barrier and enhance normally. • Fresh blood is of higher attenuation (ie whiter) than brain tissue. • In old haematomas, Hb breaks down and loses attenuation, so a subacute subdural haematoma at 2wks may be of the same attenuation as adjacent brain. • A chronic subdural haematoma will be of relatively low attenuation.
