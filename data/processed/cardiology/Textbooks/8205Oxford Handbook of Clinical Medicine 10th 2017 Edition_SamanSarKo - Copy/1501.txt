needed to reverse the eff ects of excess opioids (p842). Epidural analgesia Opioids and anaesthetics are given into the epidural space by infusion or as boluses. Ask the advice of the Pain Service. SES are thought to be less, as the drug is more localized: watch for respiratory depression and local anaesthetic- induced autonomic blockade (BP). Adjuvant treatments Eg radiotherapy for bone cancer pain; anticonvulsants, an- tidepressants, gabapentin or steroids for neuropathic pain, antispasmodics, eg hy- oscine butylbromide4 (Buscopan® 10–20mg/8h PO/IM/IV) for intestinal or renal tract colic. If brief pain relief is needed (eg for changing dressings or exploring wounds), try inhaled nitrous oxide (with 50% O2—as Entonox®) with an ‘on-demand’ valve. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), local heat, local or regional an- aesthesia, and neurosurgical procedures (eg excision of neuroma) may be tried but can prove disappointing. Treat conditions that exacerbate pain (eg constipation, depression, anxiety). 4 Not to be confused with hyoscine hydrobromide; used for drying secretions and in motion sickness. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 557744 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS WHO’s Pain relief ladder 575 Freedom from pain Opioid for moderate 3 to severe pain, +/– non-opioid +/– adjuvant pain persisting or increasing 2 Opioid for mild to moderate pain, +/– non-opioid
