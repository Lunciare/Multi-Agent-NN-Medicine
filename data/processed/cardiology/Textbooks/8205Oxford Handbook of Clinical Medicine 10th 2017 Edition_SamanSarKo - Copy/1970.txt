spinal ligaments, and then the dura, then a ‘give’ as the needle enters the suba- rachnoid space. NB: keep the bevel of the needle facing up, parallel with dural fi bres. • Withdraw stilette. Check CSF fi lls needle and attach manometer (3-way tap turned off towards you) to measure ‘opening’ pressure. • Catch fl uid in three sequentially numbered bottles (10 drops per tube). • Reinsert stilette then remove needle and apply dressing. Document the procedure clearly in the notes including CSF appearance and opening pressure. • Send CSF promptly for microscopy, culture, protein, lactate, and glucose (do plas- ma glucose too)—call the lab to let them know. If applicable, also send for: cytol- ogy, fungal studies, TB culture, virology (± herpes and other PCR), syphilis serology, oligoclonal bands (+serum sample for comparison) if multiple sclerosis suspected. Is there xanthochromia (p478)? • If you fail; ask for help—try with the patient sitting or with radiological guidance. CSF composition Normal values: Lymphocytes <5/mm3; no polymorphs; protein <0.4g/L; glucose >2.2mmol/L (or ≥50% plasma level); pressure <200mm CSF. In men- ingitis: See p822. In multiple sclerosis: See p496. Bloody tap: This is an artefact due to piercing a blood vessel, which is
