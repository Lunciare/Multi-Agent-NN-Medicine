Infl ammatory demyelination caus- es atta cks of optic neuritis ± myelitis.29 Abnormal CSF (may mimic bacterial meningi- tis) and serum anti-AQP4 antibody (in 65%) help distinguish it from MS30 (table 15.1). : IV steroids; plasma exchange. Azathioprine and rituximab31 help prevent relapses. Prognosis: Variable; complete remission may occur. Eugène Devic, 1858–1930 (French neurologist) Dressler’s syndrome This develops 2–10wks after an MI, heart surgery (or even pacemaker insertion). It is thought that myocardial injury stimulates formation of autoa ntibodies against heart muscle. Symptoms: Recurrent fever and chest pain ± pleural or pericardial rub (from serositis). Cardiac tamponade may occur, so avoid anticoagulants. : Aspirin, NSAIDS, or steroids. William Dressler, 1890–1969 (US cardiologist) Dubin–Johnson syndrome There is defective hepatocyte excretion of conjugated bilirubin. Typically presents in late teens with intermittent jaundice ± hepatospleno- megaly (autosomal recessive). Tests: Bilirubin; ALT and AST are normal; bilirubinuria on dipstick; ratio of urinary coproporphyrin I to III. Liver biopsy:
