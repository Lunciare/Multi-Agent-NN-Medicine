specifi c genetic tests for inherited neuropathies, lead level, antigan- glioside antibodies. Nerve conduction studies distinguish demyelinating from ax- onal causes. Sensory neuropathy: (Eg DM, CKD, leprosy.) Numbness; pins and needles, paraesthe- siae; aff ects ‘glove and stocking’ distribution. Diffi culty handling small objects such as buttons. Signs of trauma (eg fi nger burns) or joint deformation may indicate sensory loss. Diabetic and alcoholic neuropathies are typically painful. Motor neuropathy: (Eg Guillain–Barré syndrome, lead poisoning, Charcot–Marie– Tooth syndrome.) Often progressive (may be rapid); weak or clumsy hands; diffi - culty in walking (falls, stumbling); diffi culty in breathing (vital capacity). Signs: LMN lesion: wasting and weakness most marked in the distal muscles of hands and feet (foot or wrist drop). Refl exes are reduced or absent. Cranial nerves: Swallowing/speaking diffi culty; diplopia. Autonomic system: See BOX. Management Treat the cause (table 10.10). Involve physio and OT. Foot care and shoe choice are important in sensory neuropathies to minimize trauma. Splint- ing joints helps prevent contractures in prolonged paralysis. In Guillain–Barré and chronic infl ammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP: autoimmune demyelination of peripheral nerves), IV immunoglobulin helps. For vasculitic caus- es, steroids/immuno suppressants may help. Treat neuropathic pain with amitrip- tyline, duloxetine,
