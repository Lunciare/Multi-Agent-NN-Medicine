Poor prognostic factors: age <14yrs or syncope at presentation; family history of HCM/sudden death. Restrictive cardiomyopathy Causes: Idiopathic; amyloidosis; haemochromato- sis; sarcoido sis; scleroderma; Löffl er’s eosinophilic endocarditis; endomyocardial fi brosis. Presentation: Is like constrictive pericarditis (p154). Features of RVF pre- dominate: JVP, with prominent x and y descents; hepatomegaly; oedema; ascites. Diagnosis: Echo, MRI, cardiac catheterization. : Treat the cause. Cardiac myxoma (fi gs 3.49, 3.50) Rare benign cardiac tumour. Prevalence ≤5/10 000, :≈2:1. Usually sporadic, but may be familial (Carney complex: cardiac and cutane- ous myxomas, skin pigmentation, endocrinopathy, etc., p223). It may mimic infective endocarditis (fever, weight loss, clubbing, ESR, systemic emboli), or mitral stenosis (left atrial obstruction, AF). A ‘tumour plop’ may be heard, and signs may vary ac- cording to posture. Tests: Echo. : Excision. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 115522 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC How to infl ame the heart 153 Table 3.3 Causes of myocarditis Idiopathic 50% of cases Viral Enteroviruses, adenoviruses, HHV6, EBV, CMV, infl uenza, hepatitis, mumps, rubeola, Coxsackie, polio, HIV, HSV Bacterial Staph, Strep,
