Urgent revascularization is essential. p796. 2 ACS without ST elevation: serial troponins are needed to diff erentiate non-ST el- evated MIs (NSTEMIs) (trop rise) from unstable angina (no trop rise). p798. After the immediate actions described on pp796–9, treatment of ACS17 focuses on managing symptoms, secondary prevention of further cardiovascular disease, revas- cularization (if not already undertaken), and addressing complications. Symptom control Manage chest pain with PRN GTN and opiates. If this proves insuffi cient, consider a GTN infusion (monitor BP, omit if recent
