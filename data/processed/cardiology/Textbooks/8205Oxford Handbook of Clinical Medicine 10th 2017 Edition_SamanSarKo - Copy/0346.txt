Rare causes: Cardiom yopathy; constrictive pericarditis; sick sinus syndrome; lung cancer; endo carditis; haemochromatosis; sarcoid. ‘Lone’ AF means no cause found. Symptoms May be asymptomatic or cause chest pain, palpitations, dyspn oea, or faintness. Signs Irregularly irregular pulse, the apical pulse rate is greater than the radial rate, and the 1st heart sound is of variable intensity; signs of LVF (p800). Examine the whole patient: AF is often associated with non-cardiac disease. Tests ECG shows absent P waves, irregular QRS complexes, fi g 3.35. Blood tests: U&E, cardiac enzymes, thyroid function tests. Echo to look for left atrial enlarge ment, mitral valve disease, poor LV function, and other structural abnormalities. Managing acute AF • If the patient has adverse signs (shock, myocardial ischaemia (chest pain or ECG changes), syncope, heart failure): ABCDE, get senior input DC cardioversion (syn- chronized shock, start at 120–150J) ± amiodarone if unsuccessful (p807); do not delay treatment in order to start anticoagulation. • If the patient is stable & AF started <48h ago: rate or rhythm control may be tried. For rhythm control, DC
