(fi g 10.18). • Consider LP: If CT Ωve but the history is very suggestive of SAH (and no CI: p768). This needs to be done >12h after headache onset to allow breakdown of RBCs so that a positive sample is xanthrochromic (yellow, due to bilirubin: diff erentiaties between old blood from SAH vs a ‘bloody tap’). Management Refer all proven SAH to neurosurgery immediately. • Re-examine CNS often; chart BP, pupils, and GCS (p788). Repeat CT if deteriorating. • Maintain cerebral perfusion by keeping well hydrated, but aim for SBP <160mmHg. • Nimodipine (60mg/4h PO for 3wks, or 1mg/h IVI) is a Ca2+ antagonist that reduces vasospasm and consequent morbidity from cerebral ischaemia. • Surgery: endovascular coiling vs surgical clipping (requiring craniotomy): the decision depends on the accessibility and size of the aneurysm, though coiling is preferred where possible (fewer complications, better outcomes). Do catheter or CT angiography to identify single vs multiple aneurysms before intervening. Newer techniques such as balloon remodelling and fl ow diversion can be helpful in anatomically challenging aneurysms. Complications Rebleeding is the commonest cause of death, and occurs in 20%, often in the 1st few days. Cerebral ischaemia due to vasospasm may cause a
