an upper motor neuron lesion. (e P 3 Refl exes f For each refl ex, test right, then left and compare. If absent, attempt to elicit with ‘reinforcement’. Decide whether refl exes are absent/present (with reinforcement)/normal/brisk/exag- gerated. • Knee: (L3,4.) Strike on the patella tendon, just below the patella. • Ankle: (L5,S1.) Several accepted methods; ideally ask the patient to slightly bend the knee, then drop it laterally, grasp the foot and dorsifl ex, then strike the Achilles tendon. If hip pain limits mobility, dorsifl ex the foot with a straight leg and strike your hand, feeling for an ankle jerk. • Plantar refl exes: (L5, S1, S2.) Stroke the patient’s sole with an orange stick or similar. The normal refl ex is downward movement of the great toe. Babinski’s sign is positive if there is dorsifl exion of the great toe (this is abnormal (up- per motor neuron lesion) if patient age >6 months). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 6688 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 noitanimaxe dna yrotsiH 4 Power 69 Direct patient to adopt position and follow the following commands while you as the examiner resist movements as appropriate to grade power (p446).
