1% lidocaine. Attach a 21G needle to a syringe and insert it just above the upper border of an appropriate rib (avoids neurovascular bundle). Draw off 10–30mL of pleural fl uid and send it to the lab for clinical chemistry (protein, glucose, pH, LDH, amylase), bacteriology (microscopy and culture, auramine stain, TB culture), cytology, and, if indicated, immunology (rheumatoid factor, ANA, complement). See table 4.9. Pleural biopsy: If pleural fl uid analysis is inconclusive, consider parietal pleural biopsy. Thoracoscopic or CT-guided pleural biopsy increases diagnostic yield (by enabling direct visualization of the pleural cavity and biopsy of suspicious areas). Management is of the underlying cause. • Drainage: If the eff usion is symptomatic, drain it, repeatedly if necessary. Fluid is best removed slowly (0.5–1.5L/24h). It may be aspirated in the same way as a diagnostic tap, or using an intercostal drain (see p766). • Pleurodesis with talc may be helpful for recurrent eff usions. Thorascopic mechani- cal pleurodesis is most eff ective for malignant eff usions. Empyemas (p170) are best drained using a chest drain, inserted under ultrasound or CT guidance. • Intra-pleural alteplase and dornase alfa may help with empyema. • Surgery: Persistent collections and increasing pleural thickness (on
