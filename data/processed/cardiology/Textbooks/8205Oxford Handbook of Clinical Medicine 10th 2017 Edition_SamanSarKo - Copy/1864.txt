is altered and the diaphragm is elevated. Acclimatize yourself to the four cardinal elements of the chest radiograph, memo- rably (albeit slightly inaccurately) termed bone, air, fat, and ‘water’/soft tissue. Each has its own radiographic density. A border is only seen at an interface of two densities, eg heart (soft tissue) and lung (air); this ‘silhouette’ is lost if air in the lung is replaced by consolidation (‘water’). The silhouette sign localizes pathology (eg middle lobe pneumonia or collapse causing loss of clarity of the right heart border, fi g 16.2). When interpreting a CXR use a systematic approach that works for you, eg: Technical quality • Rotation: The sternal ends of the clavicles should symmetrically overlie the trans- verse processes of the 4th or 5th thoracic vertebrae. A rotated image can alter the position of structures, eg rotation to the right projects the aortic arch vessels over the right upper zone, appearing as though there is a mass. • Inspiration: There should be 5 to 7 ribs visible anteriorly (or 10 posteriorly). Hy- perinfl ation can be abnormal, eg COPD. Poor inspiration can mimic cardiomegaly, as the heart is usually pulled down (hence elongated) with inspiration, and crowding of
