T wave, widened QRS, absent P waves, ‘sine wave’ appearance (see fi g 14.4, p675). Hypokal aemia: Small T waves, prominent U waves, peaked P waves. Hypercal- caemia: Short QT interval. Hypocalcaemia: Long QT interval, small T waves. See p711 for causes of long QT intervals. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 9988 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC P P P P 99 First degree AV block. P–R interval = 0.28s. P P P P Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) AV block. With each successive QRS, the P–R interval increases until there is a non-conducted P wave. P P P P P Mobitz type II AV block. Ratio of AV conduction varies from 2:1 to 3:1. P P P P P P P Complete AV block with narrow ventricular complex. There is no relation between atrial and the slower ventricular activity. Fig 3.5 Rhythm strips of heart blocks. Location, location, location When considering rate and rhythm, your fi ndings should be the same in all leads, albeit clearer in some than others. Other ECG features may vary lead by lead, both in terms of what is ‘normal’ and in what a change indicates. For example, ST eleva- tion in leads II, III, and aVF suggests an inferior
