‘burning’, onset after eating/drinking, worse lying fl at, or associated with dysphagia. Palpitations ‘Ever aware of your own heartbeat’? When and how did it start/stop? Duration? Onset sudden/gradual? Associated with blackout (how long)? Chest pain? Dyspnoea? Food related (eg caff eine)? Regular fast palpitations may refl ect paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) or ventricular tachycardia (VT). Irregular fast palpitations are likely to be paroxysmal AF, or atrial fl ut- ter with variable block. Dropped or missed beats related to rest, recumbency, or eating are likely to be atrial or ventricular ectopics. Regular pounding may be due to anxiety. Slow palpitations are likely to be due to drugs such as -blockers, or bigeminus (fi g 3.34, p129). Reassurance is vital and can be therapeutic. Check a TSH and consider a 24h ECG (Holter monitor, p125). An event recorder, if available, is better than 24h ECGS. Dyspnoea Duration? At rest? On exertion? Determine exercise tolerance (and any (see p52, other reason for limitation, eg arthritis). NYHA classifi cation (p135)? and p782) Worse when lying fl at, how many pillows does the patient sleep with (orthopnoea)? Does the patient ever wake up in the night gasping for breath (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea), and how often?
