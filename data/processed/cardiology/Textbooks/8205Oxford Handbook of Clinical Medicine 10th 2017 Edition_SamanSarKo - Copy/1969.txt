Mark L 3/4 intervertebral space (or one space below, L 4/5), eg by a gentle indentation of a needle cap on the overlying skin (better than a ballpoint pen mark, which might be erased by the sterilizing fl uid). • Use aseptic technique (hat, mask, gloves, gown) and 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alco- hol to clean the skin, allow to dry and then place sterile drapes. • Open the spinal pack. Assemble the manometer and 3-way tap. Have three plain sterile tubes and one fl uoride tube (for glucose) ready. • Using a 25G (orange) needle, raise a bleb of local anaesthetic, then use a 21G (green) needle to infi ltrate deeper. • Wait 1min, then insert spinal needle (22G, stilette in place) perpendicular to the body, through your mark, aiming slightly up towards the umbilicus. Feel resistance of spinal ligaments, and then the dura, then a ‘give’ as the needle enters the suba- rachnoid space. NB: keep the bevel of the needle facing up, parallel with dural fi
