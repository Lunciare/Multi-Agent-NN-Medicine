D3 receptor agonists may cause pathological behavioural patterns, eg hypersexuality, patho- logical gambling or hobbying, and disorders of impulse control in people having no history of these. †In chronic alcohol use, GABA receptors are downregulated; acamprosate, used in alcoholism, may help to maintain GABA signalling after alcohol withdrawal. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 444499 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 450 Cerebral blood supply Knowledge of the anatomy of the blood supply of the brain helps diagnosis and management of cerebrovascular disease (pp470–8). Always try to identify the area of brain that correlates with a patient’s symptoms and identify the aff ected artery. Internal carotid arteries Supply the majority of blood to the anterior two-thirds of the cerebral hemispheres and the basal ganglia (via the lenticulos triate arteries). At worst, internal carotid artery occlusion causes fatal total i nfarction of these areas. More often, the picture is like middle cerebral artery occlusion (see later in topic). The circle of Willis (fi g 10.2) An anastomotic ring at the base of the brain fed by the three arteries that supply the brain with blood: the internal carotids (anteriorly) and the basilar artery (posteriorly, formed by the joining of the vertebral arteries, which supply the brainstem).
