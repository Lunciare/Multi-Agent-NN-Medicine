50 1 70 100 3 (nephrotic range) 250 300 Causes of raised A:CR/P:CR: The higher the proteinuria, the more chance it is caused by glomerular disease, eg glomerulonephritis, DM, amyloidosis, myeloma (though dipsticks do not detect light chains). Proteinuria is associated with an risk of cardio- vascular disease and death. False positive: Postural (repeat using an early morning sample), post-exercise, fever, heart failure. Microalbuminuria: Ultra-sensitive dipsticks are available to measure albuminuria (albumin excretion 30–300mg/24h). Suggests early glomerular disease, eg DM, BP. Haematuria Blood in the urine may arise from anywhere in the renal tract. Transient causes should be excluded, eg UTI, menstruation. Classifi ed as: • visible (VH): previously known as macroscopic, frank • non-visible (NVH): found on dipstick/microscopy, previously known as microscopic. NVH is subdivided according to the presence of urinary tract symptoms: sympto- matic (SNVH) or asymptomatic (aNVH). Causes: Malignancy (kidney, ureter, bladder), calculi, IgA nephropathy, Alport syn- drome (p320), other glomerulonephritis (p310), polycystic kidney disease (p320), schistosomiasis. Do not attribute haematuria to anticoagulation without investiga- tion. False positive: Myoglobin triggers same dipstick reaction—check microscopy. Management: VH, SNVH, and aNVH >40yr should undergo urological assessment, im- aging, and cystoscopy to exclude renal tract malignancy and calculi. A renal
