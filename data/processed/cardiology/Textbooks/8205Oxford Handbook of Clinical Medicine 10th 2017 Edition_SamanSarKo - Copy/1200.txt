50% of females reporting syn- chrony of migraines with the menstrual cycle. • Elevated levels of 5-HT metabo- lites in the urine of patients during migraine attacks was fi rst reported in 1972, and while its exact signifi cance is controversial, the effi cacy of triptans (5HT1B/1D agonists) support its role in migraine. • Triptans also inhibit release of substance P and pro-infl ammatory neuropeptides, blocking transmission from the trigeminal nerve and implicating trigeminal nerve dysfunction. The bigger picture Vincent Van Gogh suf- fered from ‘sick headaches’, widely believed to have been migraines. Could his swirl- ing, cascading starry night (fi g 10.10) be a visual aura? Just as with the fragile mental health of Van Gogh, migraine often co-exists with other chronic condi- tions—and the combined negative impact on physi- cal and mental health is immense. Don’t treat each disease in isolation. Rather, Fig 10.10 ‘The Starry Night’ Vincent Van Gogh 1889 attempt to restore a good World History Archive/Ann Ronan Collection / Age relationship with the self— Fotostock and the recovery of the pur- pose of life through dialogue. This is the hardest but the most rewarding task, and may save some ears. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 445599 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN
