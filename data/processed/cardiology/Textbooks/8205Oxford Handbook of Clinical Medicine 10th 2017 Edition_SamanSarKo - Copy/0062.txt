Prevalence is the number of cases that exist at a given time (point prevalence) or time-frame (period prevalence), divided by the total population being studied. For example, the lifetime prevalence of hiccups is ~100% and incidence is millions/year. However, the point prevalence at 3am may be 0 if no one is actually having hiccups. Comparisons of outcome frequency Diff erences in outcome rates between populations point to an association between the outcome and factors distinguishing the populations (eg a smoking population compared to a non-smoking population). Challenges arise as populations tend to diff er from each other in many ways, so it may not be clear which factor(s) aff ect outcome frequency. This leads to confounding. For example, we might fi nd that heart disease is more common in those who use walking sticks. But we cannot con- clude that walking sticks cause heart disease as age is a confounding factor: age is causal, not walking sticks. Ways of accounting for associations: A may cause B (antacids cause cancer), B may cause A (cancer causes antacid use), a 3rd unknown agent X (eg age) may cause A and B, or the association may be a chance fi nding.
