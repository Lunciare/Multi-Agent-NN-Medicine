fi sh, unsatu- rated fats; and red meat; exercise. Top  priority are those with known CVD (there is no need to calculate their risk: ipso facto they already have high risk). Second  priority is primary prevention in patients with chronic kidney disease or type-1 diabetes, and those with a 10-yr risk of CVD >10%, irrespective of baseline lipid levels. • 1st-line therapy: Atorvastatin 20mg PO at night, for primary prevention, and 80mg for secondary prevention and primary prevention in those with kidney disease.27 Simvastatin 40mg, is an alternative. cholesterol synthesis in the liver by inhibit- ing HMGCOA reductase. CI: porphyria, cholestasis, pregnancy. SE: myalgia ± myositis (stop if CK ≥10-fold; if any myalgia, check CK; risk is 1 per 100 000 treatment-years),28 abdominal pain, and LFTS (stop if AST 100U/L). Cytochrome P450 inhibitors (p689) serum concentrations (200mL of grapefruit juice simvastatin concentration by 300%, and atorvastatin 80%, but pravastatin is almost unchanged). Current guide- lines suggest a target plasma cholesterol reduction of ≥40 % in those with CVD. • 2nd-line therapy: Ezetimibe—a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, may be used in statin intolerance or combination with statins to achive target reduction. • 3rd-line therapy: Alirocumab—a monoclonal antibody against PCSK9 (acts
