injury. 2 Meningococcaemia. Symptoms/signs depends on amount of circulating bacte- ria. Mild disease presents with fever, macular rash (fi g 9.6) but no signs of shock. High-grade meningococcaemia (~30% cases) causes pyrexia and septic shock within 6–12h due to rapidly escalating endotoxin levels: circulatory failure, co- agulopathy with skin haemorrhage (fi g 9.7), thrombosis of extremities/adrenals, AKI, ARDS. Meningism may be absent. Complications: amputation, skin necrosis, pericarditis, arthritis, ocular infection, pneumonia (especially serotypes Y and W), permanent adrenal insuffi ciency.

Diagnosis: Start treatment immediately if meningitis/meningococcal sepsis is a possible diagnosis. Do not wait for confi rmation: delay can be deadly.

Cefotaxime, chloramphenicol, meropenem also bactericidal. Prevention: routine infant vaccination against capsular group C in UK. Capsular group B vaccine in UK infants since 2015: induces bacteriocidal antibodies, no population
