Handbook of Clinical medicine

the following: • Cyclizine 50mg/8h: antihistamine, anticholinergic, central action so good for in- tracranial disorders. • Metoclopramide 10–20mg/8h: blocks central chemoreceptor trigger zone, peripheral prokinetic eff ects so good in gastroparesis, monitor for extra-pyramidal side-eff ects. • Domperidone 10–20mg/8h PO: peripheral antidopaminergic so no dystonic eff ects. • Haloperidol 1.5mg PO initially 1–2 times daily: dopamine antagonist, eff ective in drug- or metabolically induced nausea, use lower doses IV/SC as twice as potent. • Ondansetron 4–8mg/8h: serotonin antagonist, good for chemo/radiotherapy-relat- ed nausea, may cause constipation. • Levomepromazine 6.25mg, initially 1–2 times daily: broad spectrum, but can sedate, may be very eff ective if fear/anxiety are contributing to symptoms. Antisecretory drugs, such as hyoscine butylbromide or octreotide may be required for patients with vomiting and bowel obstruction: seek expert advice. Constipation Causes: Very common side-eff ect of opioids. Better to prevent than treat so pre- scribe laxatives for all patients starting opioids. Also hypercalcaemia (see p528), dehydration, drugs, or intra-abdominal disease. Treatment: Treat reversible causes. Good fl uid intake. Ensure privacy and access to toilet. Medication options include the following: • Stimulant (eg senna 2–4 tablets or bisacodyl 5–10mg) at night ± a softener (eg sodium docusate 100mg BD). •
