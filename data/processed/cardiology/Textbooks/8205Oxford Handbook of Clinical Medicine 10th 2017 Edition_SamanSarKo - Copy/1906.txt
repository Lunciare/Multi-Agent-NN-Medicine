and is excellent for diagnosis of oesophageal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers. It allows staging by assessing depth of invasion, as well as histological diagnosis by biopsy of lesions. Contrast studies (fi g 16.34) These can help in dysphagia (p250) and assessing integrity of anastomoses post-op. Real-time fl uoroscopic imaging studies assess swallowing function. Barium gives better contrast but iodine-based water-soluble contrast medium is used if there is a concern of perforation. Contrast enemas are increasingly obsolete and now used to exclude a leak following a low anterior resec- tion, for proctograms, and not much else. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 774422 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR 743 Fig 16.31 Axial CT colonogram: mural thickening (?ascending colon tumour).
