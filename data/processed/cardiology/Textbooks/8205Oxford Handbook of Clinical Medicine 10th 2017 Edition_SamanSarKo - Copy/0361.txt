Echocardiography is the key investigation. 36 It may indicate the cause (MI, valvular heart disease) and can confi rm the presence or absence of LV dysfunction. Endomyocardial biopsy is rarely needed. Prognosis Poor with ~25–50% of patients dying within 5yrs of diagnosis. If admis- sion is needed, 5yr mortality ≈75%. Be realistic: in one study, 54% of those dying in the next 72h had been expected to live for >6months.37 __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 113344 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC New York classifi cation of heart failure 135 I Heart disease present, but no undue dyspnoea from ordinary activity.
