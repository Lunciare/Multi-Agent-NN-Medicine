Autonomic dysfunction: Sweating, pulse, BP changes, arrhythmias. Nerve conduction studies: Slow conduction. CSF: Protein (eg >5.5g/L), normal CSF white cell count. Respiratory involvement (the big danger) requires trans- fer to ITU. Do forced vital capacity (FVC) 4-hourly. Ventilate sooner rather than later, eg if FVC <1.5L, PaO2 <10kPa, PaCO2 >6kPa. : IV immunoglobulin 0.4g/kg/24h for 5d. Plasma exchange is good too (?more SE).45 Steroids have no role. Prognosis: Good; ~85% make a complete or near-complete recovery. 10% are unable to walk alone at 1yr. Complete paralysis is compatible with complete recovery. Mortality: 10%.
