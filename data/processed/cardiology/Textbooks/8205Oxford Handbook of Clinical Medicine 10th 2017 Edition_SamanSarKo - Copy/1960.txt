side and size of the eff usion. • Ideally use US guidance at the bedside ( chance of successful aspirate and  chance of organ puncture). If this is unavailable, ask an ultrasonographer to mark a spot, or percuss the upper border of the pleural eff usion and choose a site 1 or 2 intercostal spaces below it (usually posteriorly or laterally). • Clean the area around the marked spot with 2% chlorhexidine solution. • Infi ltrate down to the pleura with 5–10mL of 1% lidocaine. • Attach a 21G needle to a syringe and insert it just above the upper border of the rib below the mark to avoid the neurovascular bundle (fi g 18.6). Aspirate whilst advancing the needle. Draw off 10–30mL of pleural fl uid. Send fl uid to the lab for chemistry (protein, glucose, pH, LDH); bacteriology (microscopy and culture, auramine stain, TB culture); cytology, and, if indicated, amylase and immunology (rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, complement). If you cannot obtain fl uid with a 21G needle, seek help. • If any cause for concern, arrange a repeat CXR.
