problem in a primary care setting due to long transit times to the lab).5 Causes • Oliguric renal failure. • Addison’s disease (see p226). • K+-sparing diuretics. • Massive blood transfusion. • Rhabdomyolysis (p319). • Burns. • Metabolic acidosis (DM). • Drugs, eg ACE-i, suxamethonium. • Excess K+ therapy. • Artefactual result (see earlier ‘Artefactual results’). Treatment in non-urgent cases Treat the underlying cause; review medications. • Polystyrene sulfonate resin (eg Calcium Resonium® 15g/8h PO) binds K+ in the gut, preventing absorption and bringing K+ levels down over a few days. If vomiting prevents PO administration, give a 30g enema, followed at 9h by colonic irrigation. Emergency treatment If there is evidence of myocardial hyperexcitability, or K+ is >6.5mmol/L, get senior assistance, and treat as an emergency (see p301). Hypokalaemia If K+ <2.5mmol/L, urgent treatment is required. Note that hypokalaemia exacerbates digoxin toxicity. Signs and symptoms Muscle weakness, hypotonia, hyporefl exia, cramps, tetany, palpitations, light-headedness (arrhythmias), constipation. ECG Small or inverted T waves, prominent U waves (after T wave), a long PR interval, and depressed ST segments. Causes • Diuretics. • Cushing’s syndrome/steroids/ACTH. • Vomiting and diarrhoea. • Conn’s syndrome. • Pyloric stenosis. • Alkalosis. • Rectal villous adenoma. •
