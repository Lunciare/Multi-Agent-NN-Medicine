Type I respiratory failure (PaO2 <8kPa) is relatively common. Treatment is with high-fl ow (60%) oxygen. Transfer the patient to ITU if hypoxia does not improve with O therapy or PCO rises to >6kPa. Be careful with 2 a 2 O2 in COPD patients; check ABGS frequently, and consider elective ventilation if rising PaCO2 or worsening acidosis. Aim to keep SaO2 at 94–98%, PaO2 ≥8kPa.
