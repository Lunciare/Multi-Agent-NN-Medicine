Causes: Vitamin D defi ciency, alcohol withdrawal, refeeding syndrome (p587), in- adequate oral intake, severe diabetic ketoacidosis, renal tubular dysfunction and 1° hyperparathyroidism. Signs and symptoms: Muscle weakness or rhabdomyoly- sis, red cell, white cell and platelet dysfunction, and cardiac arrest or arrhythmias. Treatment: Oral or parenteral phosphate supplementation, eg Phosphate Polyfu- sor® IVI (100mmol PO43Ω in 500mL). Never give IV phosphate to a patient who is hypercalcaemic or oliguric. Hyperphosphataemia Most commonly due to chronic kidney disease, when it is treated with phosphate binders, eg sevelamer 800mg/8h PO during meals. Also cata- bolic states such as tumour lysis syndrome (p529). Magnesium Magnesium is distributed 65% in bone and 35% in cells; plasma concentration tends to follow that of Ca2+ and K+. Hypomagnesaemia Causes paraesthesiae, ataxia, seizures, tetany, arrhythmias. Digitalis toxicity may be exacerbated. Causes: Diuretics, severe diarrhoea, ke- toacidosis, alcohol abuse, total parenteral nutrition (monitor weekly), Ca2+, K+, and PO43Ω. Treatment: If needed, give magnesium salts, PO or IV (eg 8mmol MgSO4 IV over 3min to 2h, depending on severity, with frequent Mg2+ levels).
