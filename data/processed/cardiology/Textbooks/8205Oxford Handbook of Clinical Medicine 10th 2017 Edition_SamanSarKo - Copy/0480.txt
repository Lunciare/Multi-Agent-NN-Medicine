tachypnoea; tachycardia; peripheral vasodilation; bilat- eral fi ne inspiratory crackles. Investigations FBC, U&E, LFT, amylase, clotting, CRP, blood cultures, ABG. CXR shows bilateral pulmonary infi ltrates. Pulmonary artery catheter to measure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). Diagnostic criteria One consensus requires these four to exist:45 1 Acute onset. 2 CXR: bilateral infi ltrates (fi g 4.15). 3 PCWP <19mmHg or a lack of clinical congestive heart failure. 4 Refractory hypoxaemia with PaO2: FiO2 <200 for ARDS. Others include total thoracic compliance <30mL/cmH2O. Management Admit to ITU; give supportive therapy; treat the underl ying cause. • Respiratory support: In early ARDS, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) with 40–60% oxygen may be adequate to maintain oxygenation. But most patients need mechanical ventilation. Indications for ventilation: PaO2: <8.3kPa despite 60% O2; PaCO2: >6kPa. The large tidal volumes (10–15mL/kg) produced by conventional ventilation plus reduced lung compliance in ARDS may lead to high peak airway pres- sures ± pneumothorax. A low-tidal-volume, pressure-limited approach, with either low or moderate high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), improves outcome. • Circulatory support: Invasive haemodynamic monitoring with an arterial line and Swan–Ganz catheter aids the diagnosis and may be helpful in monitoring PCWP and cardiac output.
