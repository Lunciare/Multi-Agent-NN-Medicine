Acetylcholine Multiple receptors classed into muscarinic and nicotinic types. Peripher- al agonists used in glaucoma (pilocarpine); myasthenia (anticholinesterases). Peripheral antagonists used in asthma (ipratropium); incont inence; to dry secretions pre-op; to dilate pupils; to  heart rate (atropine). Centrally acting drugs include: Donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine Procyclidine, trihexyphenidyl (drug-induced (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; parkinsonism) dementia) Histamine and purines (eg ATP) Cyclizine (antihistamine; nausea) Purinergic receptor blockers (emerging role in chronic pain). Neuropeptides Multiple and growing list; includes opioids and substance P Exogenous opioids (wide-ranging anal- Aprepitant (chemotherapy-related nausea gesic and mood-related eff ects). by blocking substance P receptors). Noradrenaline, adrenaline (=norepinephrine, epinephrine) 4 rec eptor types: 1–2, 1–2. Noradrenaline is more specifi c for -receptors but both transmitters aff ect all receptors. In the periphery, -receptors drive arteriolar vasoconstriction and pupillary dilation; 1 stimulation leads to  pulse and myocardial contractility; 2 stimulation leads to bronchodi- latation, uterine relaxation, and arteriolar vasodilation. Centrally acting drugs include: Clonidine (refractory hypertension) Tricyclic antidepressants and venlafax- ine (5HT and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors; depression) MAOIs *Agonism at D3 receptor agonists may cause pathological behavioural patterns, eg hypersexuality, patho- logical gambling or hobbying, and disorders of impulse control in people having no history of these. †In chronic alcohol
