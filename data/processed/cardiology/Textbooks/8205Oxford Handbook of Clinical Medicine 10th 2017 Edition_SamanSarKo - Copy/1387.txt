privacy and access to toilet. Medication options include the following: • Stimulant (eg senna 2–4 tablets or bisacodyl 5–10mg) at night ± a softener (eg sodium docusate 100mg BD). • Osmotic laxative (eg macrogol). • Rectal treatments: bisacodyl/glycerol suppositories, phosphate enema. Breathlessness Causes: Look for reversible causes including infection, eff usion, anaemia, arrhyth- mia, thromboembolism. If stridor or signs of superior vena cava syndrome, treat urgently (see p528). Treatment: Treat reversible causes as appropriate. Consider thoracocentesis ± pleu- rodesis for a pleural eff usion. Recurrent pleural eff usions may warrant a radiologi- cally placed permanent drain (see p527). If the patient remains distressed, consider a trial of low-dose opioids. These reduce respiratory drive and the sensation of breath- lessness. If opioid-naive, start with 2.5mg of an immediate-release morphine every 4h. If already taking an opioid, use the appropriate breakthrough dose (see p533). Benzodiazepines may help if associated anxiety, eg lorazepam 500mcg SL every 4–6h. Oral problems Causes: Poor oral hygiene, radiation, drugs (anticholinergics, chemotherapy, diuret- ics), infection (candidiasis, herpes simplex). Treatment: Oral candidiasis: topical miconazole, oral fl uconazole 50mg OD but check for interactions (eg warfarin). Nystatin is often ineff ective and may exacerbate nau- sea. Herpes simplex: oral gan/aciclovir.
