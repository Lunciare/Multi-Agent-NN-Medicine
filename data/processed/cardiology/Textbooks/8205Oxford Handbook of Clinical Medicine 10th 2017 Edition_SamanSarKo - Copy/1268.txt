there is no worthwile eff ect on symptoms. Doses: • Donepezil: initially 5mg PO, eg doubled after 1 month. • Riva stigm ine: 1.5mg/12h initially,  to 3–6mg/12h. Patches are also available. • Galantamine: initially 4mg/12h,  to 8–12mg/12h PO. The cholinergic eff ects of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may exacerbate pep- tic ulcer disease and heart block. Ask about symptoms and do an ECG fi rst. Antiglutamatergic treatment: Memantine (an NMDA antagonist, p449) is reason- ably eff ective in late-stage AD, and is recommended in patients with severe disease or those with moderate disease in which AChE inhibitors are not tolerated/CI. Dose: 5mg/24h initially,  by 5mg/d weekly to 10mg/12h. SE: hallucinations, confusion, hypertonia, hypersexuality. Antipsychotics: Consider in severe, non-cognitive symptoms only (eg psychosis or extreme agitation). Possible increased risk of stroke/TIA so discuss risks and as- sess cerebrovascular risk factors. Avoid in mild-to-moderate: Lewy body dementia (risk of neuroleptic sensitivity reactions), AD, and vascular dementia. Vitamin supplementation: Trials of dietary and vitamin supplements have been mixed and disappointing. Perhaps the best evidence exists for vitamin E (2000IU OD) which may confer a modest benefi t in delaying functional progression in mild to moderate AD, but with no eff ect on
