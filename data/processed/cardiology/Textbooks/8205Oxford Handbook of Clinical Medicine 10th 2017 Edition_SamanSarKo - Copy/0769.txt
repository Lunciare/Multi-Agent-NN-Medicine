Fever, rigor, vomiting, loin pain/tenderness, costovertebral pain, associated cystitis symptoms, septic shock. • Prostatitis: Pain: perineum, rectum, scrotum, penis, bladder, lower back. Fever, malaise, nausea, urinary symptoms, swollen or tender prostate on PR. See p645. Signs Fever, abdominal or loin tenderness. Check for a distended bladder, enlarged prostate. If vaginal discharge, consider PID, see p413. Do not rely on classical symptoms and signs in a catheterized patient. Tests In non-pregnant women, if ≥ 3 (or one severe) symptoms of cystitis, and no vaginal discharge, treat empirically without further tests. • Dipstick: Use in non-pregnant women <65 years with less than three symptoms. A negative dipstick reduces probability of UTI to <20%. Do not use in pregnant women. Limited data for men. No diagnostic value in catheterized sample. • MSU culture: Conventional cut off >105 colony-forming units (cfu)/mL (but best di- agnostic criterion may be >102–103cfu/mL). Use in pregnant women, men, children, and if fail to respond to empirical antibiotics. Catheterized sample only if septic. • Blood tests: If systemically unwell: FBC, U&E, CRP, and blood culture (positive in only 10–25% of pyelonephritis). Consider fasting glucose. • Imaging: Consider USS and referral to urology for assessment (cystoscopy, urody- namics, CT) in
