Use Lund and Browder charts (see fi g 19.27) or the ‘rule of nines’ (arm: 9%; front of trunk 18%; head and neck 9%; leg 18%; back of trunk 18%; perineum 1%). Ignore erythema. Burn depth determines healing time/scarring; assessing this can be hard, even for the experienced. The big distinction is whether the burn is partial thickness (painful, red, and blistered) or full thickness (insensate/ painless; grey-white). NB: burns can evolve, particularly over the fi rst 48h. Resuscitation Resuscitate and arrange transfer to specialist burns unit for all major burns (>25% partial thickness in adults and >20% in children). Assess site, size, and depth of burn (fi g 19.27, to help calculate fl uid
