Striae mature into silvery crescents looking like the underside of willow leaves. Unsightly imma- ture striae may be improved by YAG lasers. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 222255 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE 226 Addison’s disease (adrenal insuffi ciency) Primary adrenocortical insuffi ciency (Addison’s disease) is rare (~0.8/100 000), but can be fatal. Destruction of the adrenal cortex leads to glucocorticoid (cortisol) and mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) defi ciency (see fi g 5.21). Signs are capricious: it is ‘the unforgiving master of non-specifi city and disguise’.23 You may diagnose a viral infection or anorexia nervosa in error (K+ is  in the latter but  in Addison’s). Physiology: Fig 5.21 Pathways involved in adrenal function. Causes: 80% are due to autoimmunity in the UK. Other causes: TB (commonest cause worldwide), adrenal metastases (eg from lung, breast, renal cancer), lymphoma, op- portunistic infections in HIV (eg CMV, Mycobacterium avium, p400); adrenal haem- orrhage (Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome p714; antiphosphol ipid syndrome; SLE), congenital (late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia). Secondary adrenal insuffi ciency The commonest cause is iatrogenic, due to long- term steroid therapy leading to suppression of the pituitary–adrenal axis. This only becomes apparent on withdrawal of the steroids. Other causes are rare and include hypothalamic–pituitary disease leading to ACTH production. Mineralocorticoid
