eg in pinna, tendons, joints; see fi g 12.9) and renal disease (stones, interstitial nephritis) may occur. Prevalence: ~1%.  :  ≈ 4 : 1. Diff erential diagnoses Exclude septic arthritis in any acute monoarthropathy (p544). Then consider reactive arthritis, haemarthrosis, CPPD (see following topic) and palindromic RA (p546). Risk factors Reduced urate excretion: Elderly, men, post-menopausal females, impaired renal function, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, diuretics, antihyper- tensives, aspirin. Excess urate production: Dietary (alcohol, sweeteners, red meat, seafood), genetic disorders, myelo- and lymphoproliferative disorders, psoriasis, tumour-lysis syndrome, drugs (eg alcohol, warfarin, cytotoxics). Associations: Car- diovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure (see p680).31 Gout is an independent risk factor for mortality from cardiovascular and renal disease. Screen for and treat CKD, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes. Investigations Polarized light microscopy of synovial fl uid shows negatively bi- refringent urate crystals (fi g 12.10). Serum urate (SUA) is usually raised but may be normal.32 Radiographs show only soft-tissue swelling in the early stages. Later, well- defi ned ‘punched out’ erosions are seen in juxta-articular bone (see fi g 12.6 on p541). There is no sclerotic reaction, and joint spaces are preserved until late. Treatment of acute gout High-dose NSAID (see BOX,
