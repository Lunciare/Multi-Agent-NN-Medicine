meningitis/encephalitis: mumps specifi c IgM/IgA, PCR. Treatment: Supportive. Rubella (German measles) Respiratory droplet spread. Presentation: Usually mild/subclinical. Prodrome: fever, conjunctivitis, rhinorrhoea. Rash: generalized, pink, maculopapular. Lymphadenopa- thy: occipital, cervical, post-auricular. Congenital infection: Up to 90% risk of fetal malformation in 1st trimester, sensorineural hearing loss/retinopathy in 2nd trimester. Off er IgM/IgG testing. Immunoglobulin may viraemia but will not prevent infection. Vaccinate PRE-pregnancy, live vaccines are contraindicated in pregnancy. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 440066 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI Immunization 407 Passive immunity uses pre-formed antibody to protect against infection. It of- fers immediate but short-lived protection. Natural passive immunity occurs in the placental transfer of maternal antibodies to the fetus; acquired passive immunity includes treatment with immunoglobulin eg hepatitis B, rabies, tetanus, varicella- zoster. Active immunity follows exposure to an antigen, which generates an adaptive im- mune response. Natural active immunity occurs following infection. Acquired active immunity is provided by vaccination. Routine vaccinations in the UK are shown in table 9.13. Additional vaccines are off ered to specifi c vulnerable groups (table 9.14). Immunosuppression is a contraindication to live vaccines due to the risk of dis- seminated disease. Includes immunodefi ciency, immunosuppressive treatment, HIV. Inactivated vaccines can be given but the antibody response may
