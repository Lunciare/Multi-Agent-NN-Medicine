to changes in lifestyle, but also because of better diagnosis and improved long evity.4 Higher prevalence in Asians, men, and the elderly (up to 18%). Most are over 40yrs, but teenagers are now getting type 2 DM (OHCS p156). Cause: insulin secretion ± insulin resistance. It is associated with obesity, lack of exercise, calorie and alcohol excess. 80% concordance in identical twins, indicating stronger genetic infl uence than in type 1 DM. Typically progresses from a preliminary phase of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG). (This is a unique window for lifestyle intervention.) Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare autosomal dominant form of type 2 DM aff ecting young people. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT): Fasting plasma glucose <7mmol/L and OGTT (oral glucose tolerance) 2h glucose ≥7.8mmol/L but <11.1mmol/L. Impaired fasting glucose (IFG): Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 6.1mmol/L but <7mmol/L (WHO criteria). Do an OGTT to exclude DM. The cut-off point is somewhat arbitrary. IGT and IFG denote diff erent abnormalities of glucose regulation (post-prandial and fasting). There may be lower risk of progression to DM in IFG than IGT. Manage both with lifestyle advice (p93) + annual review. Incidence of DM if IFG
