or ICP, any of which could make LP unsafe. CT angiography gives excellent mapping of the cerebral circulation (fi g 16.41), and can be done directly after unenhanced CT, looking for an aneurysm if the unenhanced CT shows subarachnoid haemorrhage. MRI (MRI in stroke: fi g 10.19, p481) The chief image sequences are: • T1-weighted images: Give good anatomical detail to which the T2 image can be compared. Fat is brightest (signal intensity); other tissues are darker to varying degrees. Flowing blood is low signal. Gadolinium contrast (p748) usually results in an increase in signal intensity. See table 16.4. • T2-weighted images: These provide the best detection of most lesions as they usu- ally contain some oedema or fl uid and therefore appear white (eg fi g 16.20, p735). Fat and fl uid appear brightest. Flowing blood is again low signal. Magnetic resonance angiography maps carotid, vertebrobasilar, and cerebral ar- terial circulations (and sinuses, veins). Functional MRI can image local blood fl ow. Catheter angiography (fi g 16.42) Less commonly used since the advent of MRA and CT angiography and perfusion techniques, though it has the advantage of allowing immediate therapy—eg coil embolization of saccular aneurysms. Radionuclide imaging (p738) PET
