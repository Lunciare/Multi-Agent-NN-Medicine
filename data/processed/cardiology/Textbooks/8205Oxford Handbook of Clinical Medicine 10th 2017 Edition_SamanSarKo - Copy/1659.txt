Obstructive uropathy In chronic urinary retention, an episode of acute retention may go unnoticed for days and, because of their background symptoms, may only present when overfl ow incontinence becomes a nuisance—pain is not necessarily a feature. After diagnosing acute on chr onic retent ion and placing a catheter, the bladder residual can be as much as 1.5L of urine. Don’t be surprised to be called by the biochemistry lab to be told that the serum creatinine is 1000μmol/L! The good news is that renal fun ction usually returns to baseline after a few days (there may be mild background impairment). Ask for an urgent renal US (fi g 13.49) Fig 13.49 Ultrasound of an obstr ucted kidney and con sider the following in the show ing hydro nephrosis. Note dilatation of renal acute plan to ensure a safe course: pelvis and ureter, and clubbed calyces. • Hyperkalaemia See p301.

Concerns should prompt discussion with a renal specialist (a good idea anyway), in case haemo- dialysis is required
