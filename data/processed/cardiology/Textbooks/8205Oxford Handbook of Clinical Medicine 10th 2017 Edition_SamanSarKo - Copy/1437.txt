in unwell patients with multi-organ involvement, especially if no infection. Systemic sclerosis Features scleroderma (skin fi brosis), internal organ fi brosis, and microvascular abnormalities. Severe cases have a 40–50% mortality at 5 years. 90% are ANA positive and 30–40% have anticentromere antibodies (see BOX). Skin dis- ease is limited or diff use. Limited involves the face, hands, and feet (formally CREST syndrome). It is associated with anticentromere antibodies in 70–80%. Pulmonary hypertension is often present subclinically, and can become rapidly life-threatening, so should be looked for (: sildenafi l, bosentan). Diffuse can involve the whole body. Antitopoisomerase-1 (SCL-70) antibodies in 40% and anti-RNA polymerase in 20%. Prognosis is often poor. Control BP meticulously. Perform annual echocardiogram and spirometry. Both limited and diff use have the potential for organ fi brosis: lung, cardiac, GI, and renal (p314) but this occurs later in limited sub-set. Management: Currently no cure. Immunosuppressive regimens, including IV cyclophosp hamide, are used for organ involvement or progressive skin disease. Trials of antifi brotic tyrosine kinase inhibitors are ongoing.41 Monitor BP and renal function. Regular ACE-i or A2RBS  risk of renal crisis (p314). Raynaud’s phenomenon: (see p708).
