Management Some arrhythmias can be managed conservatively, eg by reducing alcohol intake. Many arrhythmias respond to medical management with regular tablets or a ‘pill in the pocket’. Interventional management may include pacemakers (p132), ablation (eg of accessory pathways or arrhythmogenic foci), or implantable cardioverter defi brillators (ICDs), eg in patients with ventricular arrhythmias post-MI and in those with congenital arrhythmogenic conditions (p133). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 112244 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC Continuous ECG monitoring 125 A simple 12-lead ECG only gives a snapshot of the heart’s electrical activities. Many disorders, particularly the arrhythmias, come and go and so may be missed at the time of the ECG recording. If you feel you are missing a paroxysmal arrhythmia, there are many ways of recording the electrical activity over a longer period: Telemetry: An inpatient wears ECG leads and the signals are shown on screens being watched by staff . Thus, if a dangerous arrhythmia occurs, help is immedi- ately available. This is very resource intensive so reserved for those at high risk of dangerous arrhythmias, eg immediately post-STEMI. Exercise ECGs: The patient exercises according to a standardized protocol (eg Bruce on a treadmill) and the BP and ECG are monitored, looking for ischaemic changes,
