The vein is usually superfi cial (fi g 18.18). • Insert the introducer needle with a 5mL syringe attached, advance gently at a 45° angle, aiming Fig 18.17 Position of internal for the ipsilateral nipple and aspirating continu- jugular and subclavian veins (red) ously. If you are using US, watch the needle tip compared to the clavicle (yellow). enter the vein, if the landmark approach keep your fi ngers on the carotid pulse. • As soon as blood is aspirated, lay down the US probe and hold the introducer needle in position, remove the syringe and thread the guidewire through the needle. It should pass easily, if there is resistance try lowering the angle of the needle and gently advancing the wire. If the wire will not pass do not remove it alone, the tip can shear off Fig 18.18 Vessels seen on ultra- and embolize; remove the needle with the wire, sound. The compressible vein is above the artery. apply pressure and attempt a second
