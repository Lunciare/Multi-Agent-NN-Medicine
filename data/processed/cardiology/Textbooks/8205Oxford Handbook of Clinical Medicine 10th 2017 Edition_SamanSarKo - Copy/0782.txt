necessary and if ECG changes persist. This is cardioprotective (for 30–60min) but does not treat K+ level. 2 Intravenous insulin (10u soluble insulin) in 25g glucose (50mL of 50% or 125mL of 20% glucose). Insulin stimulates intracellular uptake of K+, lowering serum K+ by 0.65–1.0mmol/L over 30–60min. Monitor hourly for hypoglycaemia (in 11–75% of treated patients) which may be delayed in renal impairment (up to 6 hours after infusion). 3 Salbutamol also causes an intracellular K+ shift but high doses are required (10–20mg via nebulizer) and tachycardia can limit use (10mg dose in IHD, avoid in tachyarrhythmias). 4 Defi nitive treatment requires K+ removal. If the underlying pathology cannot be corrected renal replacement may be indicated. Safe transfer to an off site renal unit requires K+ <6.5mmol/L—discuss with renal team and critical care. Use of intravenous sodium bicarbonate is controversial with insuffi cient evidence that it has any additional benefi t over the treatment steps listed here. There is a risk of both sodium and fl uid overload. Bolus doses of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate should not be used. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) in AKI RRT options in AKI include haemodialysis and haemofi ltration (p306). Peritoneal dialysis is rare for AKI
