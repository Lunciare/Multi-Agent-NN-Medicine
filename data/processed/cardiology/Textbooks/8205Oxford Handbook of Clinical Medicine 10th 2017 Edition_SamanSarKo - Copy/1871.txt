a daunting task, as incorrect positioning can have deadly consequences: an NG tube which is misplaced can cause aspiration pneumonia, or a poorly positioned CVC can lead to fatal arrhythmias. However, this can be a straightforward task if you recall some basic anatomy (fi gs 16.6, 16.7; table 16.2). If you are unsure, always ask a senior.
