referral to nephrology. 2 Treatment to slow renal disease progression. 3 Treatment of renal complications ofC KD. 4 Treatment of other complications ofC KD. 5 Preparation for renal replacement therapy (dialysis/transplantation) (p306). Referral to nephrology Consider referral for: • stage G4 and G5 CKD (table 7.5) • moderate proteinuria A:CR >70mg/mmol unless due to DM and already treated • proteinuria A:CR >30mg/mmol with haematuria • declining eGFR: • eGFR by ≥25% + GFR category (table 7.5) • sustained eGFR ≥15% within 12 months • BP poorly controlled despite ≥4 antihypertensive drugs at therapeutic dose • known or suspected rare or genetic cause of CKD. Treatment to slow renal disease progression BP: Target systolic BP is <140mmHg (range 120–139mmHg) and diastolic <90mmHg. If DM or A:CR >70 then systolic target is <130mmHg (range 120–129) and diastolic <80mmHg. Renin–angiotensin system: Off er treatment with a renin–angiotensin system an- tagonist (ACE-i, ARB) to: • DM and A:CR >3mg/mmol. • Hypertension and A:CR >30mg/mmol. • Any CKD with A:CR >70mg/mmol. Do not combine renin–angiotensinsin antagonists due to risk of hyperkalaemia and hypotension. Check K+ and renal function prior to, and 1–2 weeks after, starting treat- ment or changing dose. Stop if K+ >6mmol/L, eGFR
