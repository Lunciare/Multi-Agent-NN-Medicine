normal or MCV. • Bilirubin: unconjugated, from haem breakdown (pre-hepatic jaundice). • Urinary urobilinogen (no urinary conjugated bilirubin). • Serum LDH, as it is released from red cells. 2 Is there increased red cell production? • Reticulocytes, causing MCV (reticulocytes are large immature RBCS) and poly- chromasia. 3 Is the haemolysis mainly extra- or intravascular? Extravascular haemolysis may lead to splenic hypertrophy and splenomegaly. Features of intravascular haemolysis are: • Free plasma haemoglobin: released from RBCS. • Methaemalbuminaemia: some free Hb is broken down in the circulation to pro- duce haem and globin; haem combines with albumin to make methaemalbumin. • Plasma haptoglobin: mops up free plasma Hb, then removed by the liver. • Haemoglobinuria: causes red-brown urine, in absence of red blood cells. • Haemosiderinuria: occurs when haptoglobin-binding capacity is exceeded, causing free Hb to be fi ltered by the renal glomeruli, with absorption of free Hb via the renal tubules and storage in the tubular cells as haemosiderin. This is detected in the urine as sloughed tubular cells by Prussian blue staining ~1 week after onset (implying a chronic intravascular haemolysis). 4 Why is there haemolysis? Causes are on p338.
