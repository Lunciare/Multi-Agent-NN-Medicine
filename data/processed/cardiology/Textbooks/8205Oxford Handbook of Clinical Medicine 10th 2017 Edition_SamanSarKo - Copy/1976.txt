They use less energy and are just as eff ective as monophasic defi bs in cardio version. 120–200J will cardiovert most arrhythmias. • Automatic external defi brillators: (AEDS) Can be used by anyone who can turn them on and apply the pads. Follow the instructions given by the AED. Shocking 1 Consider anticoagulation in AF (see p130). 2 Clearly state that you are charging the defi brillator. 3 Make sure no one else is touching the patient, the bed, or anything is in turn touching these. 4 Clearly state that you are about to shock the patient. 5 Give the shock. If there is a change in rhythm before you shock and the shock is no longer required, turn the dial to ‘discharge’. Do not allow anyone to ap- proach until the reading has
