Slide cannula over needle at 45° to the skin superiorly in the sagittal plane. Use a Y-connector (see fi g 18.16) or improvise con- nection to O2 supply at 15L/min: use thumb on Y-connector to allow O2 in over 1s and CO2 out over 4s (‘transtracheal jet insuffl ation’). This is the preferred method in children <12yrs. This will only sustain life for 30–45min before CO2 builds up. However, if the patient has a completely obstructed airway then they will not be able to exhale through this, and it will lead to cardiovascular compromise and pneumothoraces. 2 Cricothyroidotomy kit: Most contain a guarded blade, and a large (4–6mm) shaped cannula (cuff ed or uncuff ed depending on brand) over an introducer, plus a connector and binding tape. The patient will have to be ventilated via a bag, as the resistance is too high to breathe spontaneously. This will
