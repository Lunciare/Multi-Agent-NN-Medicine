TSH, ECG: Look for signs of IHD, AF, short PR interval (WPW syndrome), long QT interval (metabolic imbalance, drugs, congenital), U waves (hypokalaemia). 24h ECG monitoring or other continuous ECG monitoring (see BOX ‘Continuous ECG monitoring’). Echo to look for structural heart disease, eg mitral stenosis, HCM. Provocation tests: exercise ECG, cardiac catheterization ± electro- physiological studies may be needed. Narrow complex tachycardias: See pp806–7, 126. Atrial fi brillation and fl utter: See pp806–7, 130. Broad complex tachycardias: See pp804–5, 128. Bradycardia: See p808 (causes and management of acute bradycardia) and p98 (heart block). Intermittent, self-resolving bradycardic episodes can cause signifi cant problems (eg recurrent syncope). Continuous ECG monitoring (BOX ‘Continuous ECG monitoring’) will be needed to assist the diagnosis ±specialist tests (eg tilt table testing for refl ex syncope). Seek out reversible causes, eg hypothyroidism or medica- tions such as -blockers. In some cases, no reversible cause is found and the inter- mittent bradycardia is suffi ciently dangerous to warrant a permanent pacemaker (p132). See BOX, ‘Sick sinus syndrome’. Management Some arrhythmias can be managed conservatively, eg by reducing alcohol intake. Many arrhythmias respond to medical management with regular tablets or a ‘pill in the pocket’. Interventional management may
