silent or atypical, especially with immunosup- pression, eg HIV, post-transplantation. • Tuberculous lymphadenitis: (Usually) painless enlargement of cervical or su- praclavicular lymph nodes. Axillary and inguinal node involvement less common. Coexisting systemic symptoms in 40–50%. Node is typically fi rm to touch and not acutely infl amed (‘cold abscess’). Skin can adhere to the underlying mass with risk of rupture and sinus formation. Can occur with or without pulmonary disease. Investigate with fi ne-needle aspiration, AFB staining, and culture (p394). • Gastrointestinal TB: Most disease is ileocaecal. Causes colicky abdominal pain and vomiting. Bowel obstruction can occur due to bowel wall thickening, stric- ture formation, or infl ammatory adhesions. Biopsy is required for diagnosis. Ca- seation necrosis and an absence of transmural cracks/fi ssures distinguish from Crohn’s disease. • Spinal TB: Local pain and bony tenderness for weeks–months. Slow, insidious progression. May not present until deformity or neurological symptoms. Look for bony destruction, vertebral collapse, and soft tissue abscess (see Pott’s ver- tebra p708). • Miliary TB: Haematogenous dissemi- nation leads to the formation of dis- crete foci (~2mm) of granulomatous tissue throughout the lung (‘millet’ seed appearance). CXR: fi g 9.9. Dis- semination is throughout the body with meningeal
