heart failure: If BNP >100ng/L, this ‘diag- noses’ heart failure better than other clinical variables or clinical judgement (his- tory, examination, and CXR). BNP can be used to ‘rule out’ heart failure if <50ng/L. A BNP >50ng/L does not exclude other coexisting diseases; conditions that can cause BNP rises include tachycardia, cardiac ischaemia, COPD, PE, renal disease, sepsis, he- patic cirrhosis, diabetes, and old age. Also, assays vary, so liaise with your lab. Prognosis in heart failure: The higher the BNP, the higher the cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (independent of age, NYHA class, previous MI, and LV ejection fraction) and the greater the risk of sudden death. So, a patient whose symptoms are currently well controlled may benefi t from more aggressive treatment if their BNP if persistently raised. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 113377 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 138 Hypertension Hypertension 44 is the most important risk factor for premature death and CVD; caus- ing ~50% of all vascular deaths (8≈106/yr). Usually asymptomatic, so regular screen- ing (eg 3-yrly) is a vital task—most preventable deaths are in areas without universal screening. 45 Defi ning hypertension BP has a skewed normal distribution (p751) within the popu- lation, and risk is continuously related to BP,
