heart disease) • often intermittent, causing diagnostic diffi culty see BOX ‘Continuous ECG monitoring’ • occasionally severe, causing cardiac compromise which may be fatal. Emergency management: pp804–9. Causes Cardiac: Ischaemic heart disease (IHD); structural changes, eg left atrial dilatation secondary to mitral regurgitation; cardiomyopathy; pericarditis; myo- carditis; aberrant conduction pathways. Non-cardiac: Caff eine; smoking; alcohol; pneumonia; drugs (2-agonists, digoxin, L-dopa, tricyclics, doxorubicin); metabolic imbalance (K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, hypoxia, hypercapnia, metabolic acidosis, thyroid disease); and phaeochromocytoma. Presentation Palpitations, chest pain, presyncope/syncope, hypotension, or pulmo- nary oedema. Some arrhythmias may be asymptomatic, incidental fi ndings, eg AF. History Take a detailed history of palpitations (p36). Ask about precipitating fac- tors, onset/off set, nature (fast or slow, regular or irregular), duration, associated symptoms (chest pain, dyspnoea, collapse). Review drug history. Ask about past medical history and family history of cardiac disease and sudden death. Syncope occuring during exercise is always concerning; the patient may have a condition predisposing them to sudden cardiac death (eg long QT syndrome). Tests FBC, U&E, glucose, Ca2+, Mg2+, TSH, ECG: Look for signs of IHD, AF, short PR interval (WPW syndrome), long QT interval (metabolic imbalance, drugs, congenital), U waves (hypokalaemia). 24h ECG monitoring or other continuous ECG
