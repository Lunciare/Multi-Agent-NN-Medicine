estimate related to the total radiation risk, no matter how the radiation dose is distributed around the body. This table is certainly not to be learnt; rather it serves as a reminder of the relative exposures to radiation that we prescribe in practice. Remember that US and MRI involve no radiation, would they provide the answer?

Justifying exposure to ionizing radiation The very nature of ionizing radiation that gives us vision into the human body also gives it lethal properties.
