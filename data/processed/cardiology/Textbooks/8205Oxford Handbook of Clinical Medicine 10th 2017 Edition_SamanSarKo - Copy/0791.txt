antagonists due to risk of hyperkalaemia and hypotension. Check K+ and renal function prior to, and 1–2 weeks after, starting treat- ment or changing dose. Stop if K+ >6mmol/L, eGFR >25%, or creatinine >30%: ex- clude other possible causes and consider a lower dose. Glycaemic control: Target HbA1C of ~53mmol/mol (7.0%) unless risk of hypo- glycaemia, comorbidity or limited life expectancy. Lifestyle: Off er advice about exercise, healthy weight, and smoking cessation. Salt intake should be reduced to <2g of sodium/day (=<5g sodium chloride/day). Treatment of renal complications of CKD Anaemia: Check Hb when eGFR <60. Investigate (especially if anaemic with eGFR >30) and treat other defi ciencies: iron (hypochromic red cells >6%, transferrin saturation <20%, ferritin <100), B12, and folate. Do not miss chronic blood loss. Iron therapy may need to be given IV. Consider treatment with an erythropoietic stimulating agent (ESA, ‘Epo’) if Hb <110g/L and likely to benefi t in terms of function and quality of life. Pure red cell aplasia is a very rare, severe complication of ESA treatment due to anti-erythropoietin antibodies and usually causes Hb <60g/L: exclude more common causes of anaemia fi rst. Acidosis: Consider sodium bicarbonate supplements for patients with eGFR <30
