upon the patient’s risk of having a thromboem- bolic event and bleeding risk associated with the procedure.4 Where procedure has no clinically important bleeding risk it can be performed just before the next DOAC dose/18–24h after last dose and dosing restarted 6h post-op. Low bleeding risk pro- cedure, omit DOAC 24h pre-op. High bleeding risk procedure,omit DOAC 48h pre-op. If renal function impaired, may require longer periods of omission pre-op. Antiplatelets Decision to stop is complex and best discussed with the treating team (eg cardiologist or neurologist). Premature discontinuation of clopidogrel in patients with drug-eluting stents can lead to stent thrombosis. The bleeding eff ects of aspirin are reversed 5d after stopping—check local policy to see if cessation required. Surgery in those on steroids Patients on steroids may not be able to mount an appropriate adrenal response to meet the stress of surgery due to suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. Extra corticosteroid cover may be required, depending on the type of sur- gery. Consider cover for any patient taking >5mg/d of prednisolone (or equivalent) for more than 2 weeks or any patient who has had their long-term steroid reduced in the last 2–4 weeks. There is also potential for
