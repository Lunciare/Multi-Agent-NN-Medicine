t. Physiological changes in pregnancy Clinical assessment in pregnancy requires knowledge of the physiological changes associated with the gravid state. Expected changes and guidance on when to inves- tigate for possible underlying pathology is given in table 1.3. Table 1.3 Physiology and pathology in pregnancy System Normal pregnancy Consider pathology Cardiovascular BP before 20 weeks’ gestation Diastolic BP >80mmHg in 1st trimester  Heart rate Sustained tachycardia >100/min Respiratory Compensated respiratory Serum bicarbonate <18mmol/L alkalosis No change in PEFR Decrease in PEFR Respiratory rate by 10% Respiratory rate >20/min Renal GFR and creatinine clearance Creatinine >85μmol/L (eGFR not valid in pregnancy) Protein excretion Protein:creatinine ratio >30mg/mmol Endocrine Altered glucose handling Fasting glucose >5.0mmol/L Haematology Haemodilution Hb <10.5g/dL, platelets <100x109/L Radiology If the uterus is positioned outside the imaging fi eld of view, the radiation dose to the conceptus is minimal. Exposure from the following investigations is well below the threshold of risk to the fetus: • Plain radiograph: chest, extremities, spine. • CT: head, chest (but consider radiation to maternal breast in pregnancy/lactation). Ultrasound and MRI are preferentially used when imaging the abdomen. Reassure your pregnant patient that a chest x-ray is safe. It is the equivalent of 3 days
