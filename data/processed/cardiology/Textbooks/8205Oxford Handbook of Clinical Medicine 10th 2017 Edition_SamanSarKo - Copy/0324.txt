1 licences (car and motorcycle) can resume driving 1wk after successful angioplasty, or 4wk after ACS without successful angioplasty, if their ejection fraction is >40%. Group 2 licence holders must inform the DVLA of their ACS and stop driving; depending on the results of functional tests, they may be able to restart after 6wk. • Work: how soon a patient can return to work will depend on their clinical progress and the nature of their work. They should be encouraged to discuss speed of return ± changes in duties (eg to lighter work if manual labour) with their employer. Some occupations cannot be restarted post-MI: eg airline pilots & air traffi c controllers. Drivers of public service or heavy goods vehicles will have to undergo functional testing (eg exercise test), as mentioned previously. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 112200 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC Fig 3.24 Acute postero-lateral MI. The posterior infarct is evidenced by the reciprocal changes seen in V1–3: dominant R waves (‘upside-down’ pathological Q waves) and ST depression (‘upside-down’ ST elevation). If extra chest leads were added (V7–9), we would see the classic ST elevation pattern, see p 98. The ST elevation in V6 sug- gests lateral infarction. A blockage in the
