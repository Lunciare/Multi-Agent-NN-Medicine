Give O2 by mask if Pa O2 or O2 sats <95%. • Consider starting antibiotics empirically if T° >38°, unwell, or chest signs. • Measure PCV, reticulocytes, liver, and spleen size twice daily. • Give blood transfusion if Hb or reticulocytes fall sharply. This helps oxygenation, and is as good as exchange transfusion. Match blood for the blood group anti- gens Rh(C, D, E) and Kell, to prevent alloantibody formation. • Exchange transfusion is reserved for those who are rapidly worsening: it is a process where blood is removed and donor blood is given in stages. Indications: severe chest crisis, suspected CNS event, or multiorgan failure—when the propor- tion of HbS should be reduced to <30%. • Inform their haematologist of admission early.
