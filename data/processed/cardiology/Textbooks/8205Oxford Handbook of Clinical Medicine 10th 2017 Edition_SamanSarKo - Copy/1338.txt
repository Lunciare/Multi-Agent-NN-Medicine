(p400) is the main CNS pathogen in AIDS, causing cerebral abscesses which present with focal signs, eg seizures, hemiparesis. CT/MRI shows ring-shaped contrast-enhancing lesions. Treat with pyrimethamine (+folinic acid) + sulfadiazine or clindamycin for 6 months. Con- tinue secondary prophylaxis until CD4 count >200. Pneumocys tis prophylaxis also protects against toxoplasmosis. • Cryptococcus neof orm ans (fi g 10.36) causes a chronic meningitis with fever and headache (neck stiff ness may be absent). Cogni- tion alters slowly, seizures and coma may follow. Treat with amphotericin followed by fl uconazole. • Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can cause encephalopathy. • Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is caused by the JC virus. There is progres- sive white matter infl ammation. Mortality even with antiretroviral therapy is around 50% at 1yr. • Syphilis and TB may also cause meningitis. Tumours: Aff ecting the CNS include primary cerebral lymphoma (associated with EBV) and B-cell lymphoma. CSF JC virus PCR is useful in distinguishing PML from lymphoma. Neuropathies: Common in HIV, and may be a result of the disease itself or antiret- roviral therapy. Up to 30% of patients have a peripheral neuropathy, which is pain- ful and predominantly sensory. Other clinical pictures include polyradiculopathy, mononeuritis multiplex, and proximal
