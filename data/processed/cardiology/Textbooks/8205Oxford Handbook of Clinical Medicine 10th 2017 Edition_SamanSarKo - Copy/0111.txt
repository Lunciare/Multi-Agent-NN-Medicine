its reduced (hence hypoxic) form, it occurs more readily in polycythaemia than anaemia. Causes: • Lung disease with inadequate oxygen transfer, eg luminal obstruction, asthma, COPD, pneumonia, PE, pulmonary oedema—may be correctable by  inspired O2. • Congenital cyanotic heart disease, where there is a mixture, eg transposition of the great arteries or right-to-left shunt (eg VSD with Eisenmenger’s syndrome; see p156)—cyanosis is not reversed by increasing inspired oxygen. • Rare causes—methaemoglobinaemia, a congenital or acquired red cell disorder. Acute cyanosis is an emergency. Is there asthma, an inhaled foreign body, a pneu- mothorax (p749, fi g 1) or pulmonary oedema? See p814. Peripheral cyanosis will occur in causes of central cyanosis, but may also be induced by changes in the peripheral and cutaneous vascular systems in patients with nor- mal oxygen saturations. It occurs in the cold, in hypovolaemia, and in arterial disease, and is, therefore, not a specifi c sign. Pallor May be racial or familial—or from anaemia, shock/faints, Stokes–Adams attack (p460, pale fi rst, then fl ushing), hypothyroid ism, hypopituitarism, and albinism. Anaemia is haemoglobin concentration <130g/L in men and <120g/L in non-pregnant women (p324). It may be assessed from the conjunctivae and skin creases. Koilo- nychia
