to combination of pallor (anaemia) and mild jaundice (due to haemolysis), glossitis (beefy-red sore tongue; fi g 8.27), angular cheilosis (p326). Neuropsychiatric: Irritability, depression, psychosis, dementia. Neurological: Paraesthesiae, peripheral neuropathy. Also subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord, a combination of peripheral sensory neuropa- thy with both upper and lower motor neuron signs due to B12. The patient may display the classical triad of: • extensor plantars (UMN) • absent knee jerks (LMN) • absent ankle jerks (LMN). The onset is insidious (subacute) and signs are symmet- rical. There is a combination of poste rior (dorsal) column loss, causing the sensory and LMN signs, and corticospinal tract loss, causing the motor and UMN signs (p446). The spinothalamic tracts are preserved so pain and temperature sensation may remain intact even in severe cases. Joint-position and vibration sense are often aff ected fi rst leading to ataxia, followed by stiff ness and weakness if untreated. The neurological signs of B12 defi ciency can occur without anaemia. Pernicious anaemia (PA) This is an autoimmune condition in which atrophic gastritis leads to a lack of IF secretion from the parietal cells of the stomach. Dietary B12 there- fore remains unbound and conseqeuently cannot be
