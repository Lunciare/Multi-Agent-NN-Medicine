anaemia; lead poisoning; bad infections (fi g 8.13).1 Dimorphic picture: Two populations of red cells. Seen after treatment of Fe, B12, or folate defi ciency, in mixed defi ciency (Fe with B12 or folate), post-transfusion, or with primary sideroblastic anaemia, where a clone of abnormal erythroblasts produce abnormal red cells, alongside normal red cell production. Howell–Jolly bodies: DNA nuclear remnants in RBCS, which are normally removed by the spleen (fi g 8.14). Seen post-splenectomy and in hyposplenism (eg sickle-cell disease, coeliac disease, congenital, UC/Crohn’s, myeloproliferative disease, amyloid). Also in dyserythropoietic states: myelodysplasia, megaloblastic anaemia. Hypochromia: (p326.) Less dense staining of RBCS due to Hb synthesis, seen in IDA, thalassaemia, and sideroblastic anaemia (iron stores unusable, p366). Left shift: Immature neutrophils released from the marrow, eg in infection (fi g 8.15). Leukoerythroblastic fi lm: Immature cells (myelocytes, promyelocytes, metamyelo- cytes, normoblasts) ± tear-drop RBCS from haemolysis or marrow infi ltration/infec- tion (maligna ncy; TB; brucella; visceral leishmaniasis; parvovirus B19) . Leukaemoid reaction: A marked leucocytosis (WCC >50≈109/L). Seen in severe illness, eg with infection or burns, and also in leukaemia. Pappenheimer bodies: (fi g 8.16) Granules of siderocytes containing iron. Seen in lead poisoning, carcinomatosis, and post-splenectomy. Poikilocytosis: Variation in RBC
