• Haematological: lymphoma or leukaemia: ALL, CLL, AML (p356). • Metastatic carcinoma: from breast, lung, bowel, prostate, kidney, or head and neck cancers. Oedema (See p579.) Pitting oedema: Fluid can either be squeezed out of the veins (increased hydrostatic pressure, eg DVT, right heart failure) or diff use out because of reduced oncotic pres- sure (low plasma proteins, eg cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, protein-losing enter- opathy) leading to an osmotic gradient with the tissues (fi g 2.9, p39, p579). The cause of oedema is still not completely understood.5 Periorbital oedema: Oedema around the face has a very diff erent diff erential; the eyelid skin is very thin so periorbital oedema is usually the fi rst sign—think of al- lergies (contact dermatitis, eg from eye make-up, stings), angioedema (can be hereditary), infection (orbital cellulitis can be life-threatening, refer to hospital immediately if concerned, other infections include EBV and sinusitis); if there is prop- tosis (p219) think Graves’ disease, connective tissue diseases (eg dermatomyositis, SLE, sarcoid, amyloid); and many others. Assess for systemic disease before putting it down to allergies. Non-pitting oedema: Ie non-indentable, is lymphoedema due to poor lymphatic drainage. Can be due to radiotherapy, malignant infi ltration, infection, fi lariasis, or
