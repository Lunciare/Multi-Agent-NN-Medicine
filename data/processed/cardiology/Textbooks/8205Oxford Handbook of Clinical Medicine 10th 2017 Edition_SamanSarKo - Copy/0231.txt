you mean the same as your patient and colleagues, as dysuria refers to both painful micturition (‘uralgia') and diffi cult micturition (voiding diffi culty, p81). Uralgia is typically from urethral, bladder, or vaginal infl ammation (UTI; perfumed bath products, spermicides, urethral syndrome, p300). If post menopausal, look for a urethral caruncle—fl eshy outgrowth of distal urethral mucosa, 1cm, typically origi- nating from the posterior urethral lip. Also think of prostatitis, STI/urethritis (p413), vaginitis, and vulvitis. Rare causes: Stones, urethral lesions (eg car cinoma, lympho- ma, papilloma), post-partum complications (eg retained products of conception). Voiding diffi culty is a sign of outfl ow obstruction, eg from an enlarged prostate, or urethral stricture (commonly post-traumatic, post-gonococcal). Other features: straining to void, poor stream, urinary retention, and incontinence. Strang ury is urethral pain, usually referred from the bladder base, causing a constant distr es sing desire to urinate even if there is little urine to void. Causes: Stones, catheters, cys- titis, prostati tis, bladder neoplasia, rarely: bladder endometriosis, schistosomiasis. Frequency Aim to diff erentiate urine production (eg diabetes mellitus and insipidus, polydip- sia, diuretics, alcohol, renal tubular disease, adrenal insuffi ciency) from frequent passage of small amounts of urine (eg in cystitis, urethritis,
