a rare (~5 cases per million/year) stem cell disorder in which bone marrow stops making cells, leading to pancytopenia. Presents with features of anaemia (Hb), infection (WCC), or bleeding (platelets). Causes: Most cases are autoim- mune, triggered by drugs, viruses (eg parvovirus, hepatitis), or irradiation. May also be inherited, eg Fanconi anaemia (p698). Tests: Bone marrow biopsy is diag- nostic. Treatment: Mainly supportive in asymptomatic patients. Transfuse blood products as required and initiate neutropenic regimen if count <0.5≈109/L (p352). The treatment of choice in young patients with severe disease is allogeneic mar- row transplantation from an HLA-matched sibling, which can be curative. Other- wise, immunosuppression with ciclosporin and antithymocyte globulin may be eff ective, although it is not curative in most. There is no clear role for G-CSF. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 336644 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 365 Fig 8.66 Haematopoiesis and Sod’s law. When we contemplate a diagram like this (of seem- ingly galactic complexity) we, being doctors, think ‘What can go wrong?’ With a sinking feeling we realize that every arc is an opportunity for multiple disasters. Perhaps, using the Hammer of Los (p322) and our own ingenuity we might occasionally complete these pathways without Sod intervening (Sod’s law states that if
