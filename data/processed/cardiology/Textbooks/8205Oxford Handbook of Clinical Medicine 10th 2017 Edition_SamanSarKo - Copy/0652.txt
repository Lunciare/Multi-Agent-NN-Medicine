do a PR to check for melaena. Is the patient shocked? Also: • Peripherally cool/clammy; capillary refi ll time >2s; urine output <0.5mL/kg/h. • GCS (tricky to assess in decompensated liver disease) or encephalopathy (p275). • Tachycardic (pulse >100bpm). • Systolic BP <100mmHg; postural drop >20mmHg. • Calculate the Rockall score (tables 6.6, 6.7). Acute management (p820.) Skill in resuscitation determines survival, so get good at this! Summary:5 start by protecting the airway and giving high-fl ow O 2, then:  Insert 2 large-bore (14–16G) IV cannulae and take blood for FBC (early Hb may be normal because haemodilution has not yet taken place), U&E (urea out of propor- tion to creatinine indicative of massive blood meal), LFT, clotting, and crossmatch.  Give IV fl uids (p821) to restore intravascular volume while waiting for cross- matched blood. If haemodynamically deteriorating despite fl uid resuscitation, give group O RhΩve blood. Avoid saline if cirrhotic/varices.  Insert a urinary catheter and monitor hourly urine output.  Organize a CXR, ECG, and check ABG.  Consider a CVP line to monitor and guide fl uid replacement.  Transfuse (with crossmatched blood if needed) if signifi cant Hb drop (<70g/L).  Correct clotting abnormalities
