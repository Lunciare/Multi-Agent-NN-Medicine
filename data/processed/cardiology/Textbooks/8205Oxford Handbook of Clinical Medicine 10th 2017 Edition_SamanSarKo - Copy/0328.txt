malignant ventricular arrhythmias Occur 1–3wks post-MI and are the cardi- ologist’s nightmare. Avoid hypokalaemia, the most easily avoidable cause. Consider 24h ECG monitoring prior to discharge if large MI. Dressler’s syndrome (p698) Recurrent pericarditis, pleural eff usions, fever, anae- mia, and ESR 1–3wks post-MI. Treatment: consider NSAIDS; steroids if severe. Left ventricular aneurysm This occurs late (4–6wks post-MI), and presents with LVF, angina, recurrent VT, or systemic embolism. ECG: persistent ST-segment elevation. Treatment: anticoagulate, consider excision. 3 JVP rises during inspiration. Adolf Kussmaul was a prominent 19th-century physician and the fi rst to attempt gastroscopy. Inspired by a sword swallower he passed a rigid tube into the stomach, however light technology was limited and it was not until years later that gastroscopists could visualize the stomach. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 112222 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) 123 CABG is performed in left main stem disease; multi-vessel disease; multiple se- vere stenoses; patients unsuitable for angioplasty; failed angioplasty; refractory angina. Indications for CABG—to improve survival: • Left main stem disease. • Triple-vessel disease involving proximal part of the left anterior descending. Indications for CABG—to relieve symptoms: • Angina unresponsive to drugs. • Unstable angina (sometimes). • If angioplasty is unsuccessful.
