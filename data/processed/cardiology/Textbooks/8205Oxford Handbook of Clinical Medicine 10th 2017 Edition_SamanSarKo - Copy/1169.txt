Sensory loss may be confi ned to discriminative functions, eg stereognosis and two-point discrimina- tion (p499). Internal capsule (p470) and corticospinal tract lesions cause con- tralateral hemiparesis (UMN signs). There is generalized contralateral sensory loss. A cranial nerve palsy (III–XII) contralateral to a hemiple gia implicates the brain- stem on the side of the cranial nerve palsy. Lateral brainstem lesions show both dissociated and crossed sensory loss with pain and T° loss on the side of the face ipsilateral to the lesion, and contralateral arm and leg sensory loss. Cord lesions causing paraparesis (both legs) or quadriparesis/tetra plegia (all limbs) are sug- gested by fi nding a motor and refl ex level (power is unaff ected above the lesion, with LMN signs at the level of
