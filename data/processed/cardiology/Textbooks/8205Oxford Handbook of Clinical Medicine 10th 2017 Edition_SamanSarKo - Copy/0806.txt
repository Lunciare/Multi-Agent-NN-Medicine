immunosuppression. Chronic antibody-mediated rejection causes progressive dys- function of the graft. Most graft loss is now thought to be due to an immune re- sponse by donor-specifi c antibodies causing damage to the kidney microcirculation. Complex pathology and lack of controlled studies mean treatment is not clear. The results of monoclonal antibody trials are awaited. Infection: Risk of all infections. Typically hospital acquired/donor derived in month 1, opportunistic in months 1–6 (therefore prophylactic treatment for CMV and Pneu- mocystis jirovecii given), usual spectrum of community-acquired infection after 6–12 months. Late viral infection should always be considered: eg CMV, HSV. Malignancy: Up to 25≈ risk of cancer with immunosuppression, particularly skin, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), and gynaecological. CVD: 3–5≈ risk of premature CVD compared to general population (but ~80% less than dialysis). BP, NODAT, rejection, and renal history (uraemic cardiomyopathy) contribute. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 330088 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR Prognosis 309 Acute rejection <15%, 1-year graft survival >90%. Longer-term graft loss ~4%/year. Factors contributing to graft loss: • Donor factors: age, comorbidity, living/deceased, DBD/DCD. • Rejection. • Infection. • BP/CVD. • Recurrent renal disease in graft. Most common outcome is death with a functioning transplant (ie transplant ‘out- lives’ the patient). When a
