palm look particularly at the thenar and hypothenar eminences. • Thenar wasting (fi g 2.37) = median nerve lesion. • Generalized wasting, particularly of the interossei on the dorsum, but sparing of the thenar eminence = ulnar nerve lesion. Also look for Dupuytren's contracture and Fig 2.37 Thenar wasting. perform Tinel's test (percuss over the distal skin crease of the wrist). Phalen's test (patient holds dorsal surfaces of both hands together for 60 seconds). Both tests are positive if tin- gling reported, suggesting carpal tunnel syn- drome. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 7744 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 noitanimaxe dna yrotsiH 75 Joints Examine for acute infl ammation (swol- len, red joints) as well as the charac- teristic deformities of chronic arthritis, eg rheumatoid, osteoarthritis (fi g 2.38). • Ulnar deviation at the wrist. • Z deformity of the thumb. • Swan-neck (fl exed DIP, hyperextended Fig 2.38 Osteoarthritis.
