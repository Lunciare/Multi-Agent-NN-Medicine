IHD diagnosis—see BOX. Management Address exacerbating factors: Anaemia, tachycardia (eg fast AF), thyrotoxicosis. Secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease: • Stop smoking; exercise; dietary advice; optimize hypertension and diabetes control. • 75mg aspirin daily if not contraindicated. • Address hyperlipidaemia—see p690. • Consider ACE inhibitors, eg if diabetic. PRN symptom relief: Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) spray or sublingual tabs. Advise the pa- tient to repeat the dose if the pain has not gone after 5min and to call an ambulance if the pain is still present 5min after the second dose. SE: headaches, BP. Anti-anginal medication: (p114) First line: -blocker and/or calcium channel blocker (do not combine -blockers with non-dihydropyridine calcium antagonists). If these fail to control symptoms or are not tolerated, trial other agents. • -blockers: eg atenolol 50mg BD or bisoprolol 5–10mg OD. • Calcium antagonists: amlodipine—start at 5mg OD; diltiazem—dose depends on formulation. • Long-acting nitrates: eg isosorbide mononitrate—starting regimen depends on formulation. Alternatives: GTN skin patches. SES: headaches, BP. • Ivabradine: reduces heart rate with minimal impact on BP. Patient must be in sinus rhythm. Start with 5mg BD (2.5mg in elderly). • Ranolazine: inhibits late Na+ current. Start at 375mg BD. Caution if heart failure, elderly, weight
