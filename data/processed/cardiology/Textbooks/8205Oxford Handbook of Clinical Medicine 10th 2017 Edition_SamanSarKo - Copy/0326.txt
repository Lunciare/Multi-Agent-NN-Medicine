QRS, reasonably stable and pulse 40–50). Bundle branch block: MI complicated by trifascicular block or non-adjacent bifascicular disease (p132) should be paced. Tachyarrhythmias NB: K+, hypoxia, and acidosis all predispose to arrhythmias and should be corrected. Sinus tachycardia: Can  myocardial O2 demand, treat causes (pain, hypoxia, sepsis, etc.) and add -blocker if not contraindicated. SVT: p126. AF or fl utter: If compromised, DC cardioversion. Otherwise, medical therapy as per p130. Frequent PVCs (premature ventricular complexes) and non-sustained VT (≥3 consecutive PVCS >100bpm and lasting <30s) are common after acute MI and are as- sociated with increased risk of sudden death. Correct hypokalaemia and hypomag- nesaemia and ensure the patient is on -blockers, if not contraindicated.19 Sustained VT: (Consecutive PVCS >100bpm and lasting >30s.) Treat with synchronized DC shock (if no pulse, treat as per advanced life support algorithm, see p894, fi g A3). Use anti-arrhythmics only if VT recurrent and not controlled with shocks. Consider abla- tion +/or ICD. Ventricular fi brillation: 80% occurs within 12h. VF occuring after 48h usually indicates pump failure or cardiogenic shock. : DC shock (see p894, fi g A3), consider ICD. Right ventricular failure (RVF)/infarction Presents with low cardiac output and JVP. Fluid
