to avoid intravascular volume depletion and secondary AKI. Thiazide diuretics can be added if oedema remains resistant to high-dose loop diuretics. Albumin infusion increases proteinuria and remains controversial with no consistent evidence of benefi t. 2 Treat underlying cause Adults need a renal biopsy (p310). This is technically more diffi cult when there is gross oedema so diuresis may be required fi rst. Treatment known to induce remission should be given, eg corticosteroids in minimal change disease. Look for and treat any underlying systemic disease, infection, or malignancy. In children, minimal change disease is the commonest aetiology and steroids induce remission in the majority. Biopsy is therefore avoided in children unless there is no response to steroids, or if clinical features suggest another cause: age <1yr, family history, extrarenal disease (eg arthritis, rash, anaemia), renal failure, haematuria. 3 Reduce proteinuria ACE-i/ARB reduce proteinuria (may not be needed in minimal change disease). 4 Complications • Thromboembolism. Hypercoagulable due to clotting factors, anti-thrombin III, and platelet abnormalities. Risk of VTE including DVT/PE (~10% adult pa- tients) and renal vein thrombosis (loin pain, haematuria, LDH, AKI if bilateral). Treat with heparin (may need to dose adjust low-molecular-weight heparin if GFR) and warfarin. If
