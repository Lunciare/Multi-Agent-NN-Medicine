He also espoused iatrochemistry: a theory of medicine ac- cording to which all morbid conditions of the body can be explained by distur- bances in the fermentations and eff ervescences of its humours. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 445511 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 452 Testing peripheral nerves While there is some anatomical variation between individuals in ascribing particular nerve roots to muscles, tables 10.2–10.4 represent a reasonable compromise. Der- matomes and sensory nerve roots are shown in fi gs 10.5-10.9, pp454-5.
