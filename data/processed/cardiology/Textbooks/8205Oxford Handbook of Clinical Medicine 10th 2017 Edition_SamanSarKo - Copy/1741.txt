due to water loss in excess of Na+ loss: • Fluid loss without water replacement (eg diarrhoea, vomit, burns). • Diabetes insipidus (p240). Suspect if large urine volume. This may follow head in- jury, or CNS surgery, especially pituitary. • Osmotic diuresis (for diabetic coma, see p832). • Primary aldosteronism: rarely severe, suspect if BP, K+, alkalosis (HCO3Ω). • Iatrogenic: incorrect IV fl uid replacement (excessive saline). Management Give water orally if possible. If not, give glucose 5% IV slowly (1L/6h) guided by urine output and plasma Na+. Use 0.9% saline IV if hypovolaemic, since this causes less marked fl uid shifts and is hypotonic in a hypertonic patient. Avoid hypertonic solutions. Hy ponatraemia Plasma Na+ concentration depends on the amount of both Na+ and water in the plasma. Hyponatraemia therefore does not necessarily imply Na+ depletion. Assess- ing fl uid status is the key to diagnosis (see fi g 14.3). Signs and symptoms Look for anorexia, nausea, and malaise initially, followed by headache, irritability, confusion, weakness, GCS, and seizures, depending on the se- verity and rate of change in serum Na+. Cardiac failure or oedema may help to indi- cate the cause. Hyponatraemia also increases the risk of falls
