long PR interval, and depressed ST segments. Causes • Diuretics. • Cushing’s syndrome/steroids/ACTH. • Vomiting and diarrhoea. • Conn’s syndrome. • Pyloric stenosis. • Alkalosis. • Rectal villous adenoma. • Purgative and liquorice abuse. • Intestinal fi stula. • Renal tubular failure (p316 & p664). If on diuretics, HCO3Ω is the best indication that hypokalaemia is likely to have been long-standing. Mg2+ may be low, and hypokalaemia is often diffi cult to correct until Mg2+ levels are normalized. Suspect Conn’s syndrome if hypertensive, hypokalaemic alkalosis in someone not taking diuretics (p228). In hypokalaemic periodic paralysis, intermittent weakness lasting up to 72h ap- pears to be caused by K+ shifting from extra- to intracellular fl uid. See OHCS p652. Treatment If mild: (>2.5mmol/L, no symptoms.) Give oral K+ supplement (≥80mmol/24h, eg Sando-K® 2 tabs/8h). Review K+ after 3 days. If taking a thi- azide diuretic, and K+ >3.0 consider repeating and/or K+-sparing diuretic. If severe: (<2.5mmol/L, and/or dangerous symptoms.) Give IV potassium cautiously, not more than 20mmol/h, and not more concentrated than 40mmol/L. Do not give K+ if oliguric. Never give K+ as a fast stat bolus dose. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 667744 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC Fig 14.4 Hyperkalaemia—note the fl attening of
