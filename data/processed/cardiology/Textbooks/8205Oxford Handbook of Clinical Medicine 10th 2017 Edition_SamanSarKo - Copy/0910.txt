(LMWH): Eg dalteparin, enoxaparin, tinzapa- rin. The preferred option in the prevention and initial treatment of venous thromboem- bolism. Inactivates factor Xa (but not thrombin). t½ is 2- to 4-fold longer than standard heparin, and response is more predictable: only needs to be given once or twice daily SC, and laboratory monitoring is usually not required. See BNF for doses. It accumulates in renal failure: decrease dose for prophylaxis, use UFH for therapeutic treatment 2 Unfractionated heparin (UFH): IV or SC. Binds antithrombin (an endogenous in- hibitor of coagulation), increasing its ability to inhibit thrombin, factor Xa, and IXa. Rapid onset and has a short t½. Monitor and adjust dose with APTT (p346). SE for both: Bleeding (eg at operative site, gastrointestinal, intracranial), heparin- induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), osteoporosis with long-term use. HIT and osteo- porosis are less common with LMWH than UFH. Beware hyperkalaemia. CI: Bleeding disorders, platelets <60≈109/L, previous HIT, peptic ulcer, cerebral haemorrhage, severe hypertension, neurosurgery. Warfarin Used PO OD as long-term anticoagulation. The therapeutic range is nar- row, varying with the condition being treated (see BOX ‘Warfarin guidelines and target levels for INR’)—and eff ects are refl ected in the INR. Warfarin inhibits the re- ductase enzyme
