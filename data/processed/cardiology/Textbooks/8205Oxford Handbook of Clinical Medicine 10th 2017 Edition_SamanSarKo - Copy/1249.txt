Bloods: Thrombophilia screen. Imaging: CT/MRI venog- raphy may show the absence of a sinus (fi g 10.19), though an absent transverse sinus can be a normal variant. MRI T2-weighted gradient echo sequences can visualize thrombus directly (fi g 10.20), and also identify haemorrhagic infarction. CT may be normal early, but show a fi lling defect at ~1wk (delta sign). LP (if no CI): raised open- ing pressure. CSF may be normal, or show RBCS and xanthochromia. Management Seek expert help. Anticoagulation with heparin or LMWH and then warfarin (INR 2–3) may benefi t even if there is secondary cerebral haemorrhage (un- less otherwise CI). If there is deterioration despite adequate anticoagulation, endo- vascular thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy may provide limited benefi t (but not in those with large infarcts and impending herniation). ICP requires prompt at- tention (p830); decompressive hemicraniectomy may prevent impending herniation. 9 Predictors of poor prognosis include: GCS score on admission <9, deep CVT location, CNS infection, malig- nancy, intracranial haemorrhage, mental status abnormality, age >37 years, and . __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 448800 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 481 Fig 10.19 This magnetic resonance venogram (MRV) could look normal at fi rst glance: the hardest thing to see in imaging is
