last pregnant’. So here we have the well-known ‘physiological acromegaly of pregnancy’14 predating the pathological, as the carni- val of personal identity moves from helter-skelter to roller-coaster. 14 GH variants made by the placenta rise exponentially until 37wks’ gestation; pituitary GH gradually drops to near-undetectable levels. ‘Gestational acromegaly’ probably develops to foster fetoplacental growth; its side-eff ects include facial oedema, carpal tunnel symptoms, and nose enlargement. 15 Puberty sees GH- and gonad-mediated rises in bone and muscle mass + other ‘acromegalic’ eff ects. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 223399 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE 240 Diabetes insipidus (DI) Physiology This is the passage of large volumes (>3L/day) of dilute urine due to impaired water resorption by the kidney, because of reduced ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary (cranial DI) or impaired response of the kidney to ADH (nephro- genic DI). Symptoms Polyuria; polydipsia; dehydration; symptoms of hypernatraemia (p672). Polydipsia can be uncontrollable and all-consuming, with patients drinking anything and everything to hand: in such cases, if beer is on tap, disaster will ensue! Causes of cranial DI •Idiopathic (50%). •Congenital: defects in ADH gene, DIDMOAD.16 •Tumour (may present with DI + hypopituitarism): craniopharyn gioma, metastases, pituitary tumour. •Trauma: temporary if distal to pituitary stalk as proximal
