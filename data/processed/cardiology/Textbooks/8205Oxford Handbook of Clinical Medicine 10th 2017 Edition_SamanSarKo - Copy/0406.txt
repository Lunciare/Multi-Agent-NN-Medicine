and signs: Sudden death may be the fi rst manifestation of HCM in many patients (VF is amenable to implantable defi brillators), angina, dyspnoea, palpitation, syncope, CCF. Jerky pulse; a wave in JVP; double-apex beat; systolic thrill at lower left sternal edge; harsh ejection systolic murmur. Tests: • ECG: LVH; progressive T-wave inversion; deep Q waves (inferior + lateral leads); AF; WPW syndrome (p133); ventricular ectopics; VT. • Echo: asymmetrical septal hypertrophy; small LV cavity with hypercontractile pos- terior wall; midsystolic closure of aortic valve; systolic anterior movement of mitral valve. • MRI: see fi g 3.16. • Cardiac catheterization helps assess: severity of gradient; coronary artery disease or mitral regurgitation, but may provoke VT. • Electrophysi- ological studies may be needed (eg if WPW, p133). • Exercise test ± Holter monitor (p125) to risk stratify. : -blockers or verapamil for symptoms (the aim is reducing ventricular contractility). Amiodarone (p130) for arrhythmias (AF, VT). Anticoagulate for paroxysmal AF or systemic emboli. Septal myomectomy (surgical or chemical (with alcohol) to LV outfl ow tract gradient) is reserved for those with severe symp- toms. Consider implantable defi brillator—use to assess risk of sudden cardiac death. Mortality: 5.9%/yr if <14yrs; 2.5%/yr if >14yrs.
