ABG.  Consider a CVP line to monitor and guide fl uid replacement.  Transfuse (with crossmatched blood if needed) if signifi cant Hb drop (<70g/L).  Correct clotting abnormalities (vitamin K (p274), FFP, platelets).  If suspicion of varices then give terlipressin IV eg 1–2mg/6h for ≤3d; relative risk of death  by 34%. Initiate broad-spectrum IV antibiotic cover.  Monitor pulse, BP, and CVP (keep >5cmH2O) at least hourly until stable.  Arrange an urgent endoscopy (p248).  If endoscopic control fails, surgery or emergency mesenteric angiography/ embolization may be needed. For uncontrolled oesophageal variceal bleeding, a Sengstaken–Blakemore tube may compress the varices, but should only be placed by someone with experience. Further management Anatomy is important in assessing risk of rebleeding. Posterior DUs are highest risk as they are nearest to the gastroduodenal artery. • Re-examine after 4h and consider the need for FFP if >4 units transfused. • Hourly pulse, BP, CVP, urine output (4hrly if haemo dynamically stable may be OK). • Transfuse to keep Hb >70g/L; ensure a current valid group & save sample. • Check FBC, U&E, LFT, and clotting daily. • Keep nil by mouth if at high rebleed risk (see BOX
