burns unit for all major burns (>25% partial thickness in adults and >20% in children). Assess site, size, and depth of burn (fi g 19.27, to help calculate fl uid requirements). Referral is still war- ranted in cases of full thickness burns >5%, partial thickness burns >10% in adults or >5% in children or the elderly, burns of special sites, chemical and electrical burns, and burns with inhalational injury. • Airway: Beware of upper airway obstruction developing if hot gases inhaled. Sus- pect if history of fi re in enclosed space, soot in oral/nasal cavity, singed nasal hairs or hoarse voice. A fl exible laryngo/bronchoscopy is useful. Involve anaesthetists early and consider early intubation. Obstruction can develop in the fi rst 24h. • Breathing: Exclude life-threatening chest injuries (eg tension pneumothorax) and constricting burns—consider escharotomy if chest burns are impairing thorax ex- cursion (OHCS p766). Give 100% O2. Suspect carbon monoxide poisoning (p842) from history, cherry-red skin, and carboxyhaemoglobin level (COHb). With 100% O2 t½ of COHb falls from 250min to 40min (consider hyperbaric O2 if: pH<7.1; CNS signs; >25% COHb or >20% if pregnant). SpO2 (oxime try) is unreliable in CO poisoning. • Circulation: Partial thickness burns >10% in
