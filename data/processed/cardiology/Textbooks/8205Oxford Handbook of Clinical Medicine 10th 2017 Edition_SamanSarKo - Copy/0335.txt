Sick sinus syndrome Sick sinus syndrome is usually caused by sinus node fi brosis, typically in elderly patients. The sinus node becomes dysfunctional, in some cases slowing to the point of sinus bradycardia or sinus pauses, in others generating tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fi brillation and atrial tachycardia. Symptoms: Syncope and pre-syncope, light-headedness, palpitations, breathless- ness. Management: • Thromboembolism prophylaxis if episodes of AF are detected. • Permanent pacemakers for patients with symptomatic bradycardia or sinus pauses. Some patients develop a ‘tachy brady syndrome’, suff ering from alternating tachycardic and bradycardic rhythms. This can prove diffi cult to treat medically as treating one circumstance (eg
