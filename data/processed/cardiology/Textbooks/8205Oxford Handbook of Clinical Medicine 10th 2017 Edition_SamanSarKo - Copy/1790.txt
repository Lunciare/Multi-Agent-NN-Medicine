Estimates of prevalence vary widely, but in patients with a history of symptomatic GORD, rates of ≈8% have been reported. Importantly, screening studies in asympto- matic individuals have reported rates of ≈6%. General population-based screening is not recommended, although screening endoscopy may be considered in individuals with chronic GORD symptoms and multiple risk factors (>50 years old, obesity, , white race, family history of Barrett's or oesophageal adenocarcinoma). Diagnosis: Biopsy of endoscopically visible columnarization allows histological corroboration. The length should be recorded (using the Prague classifi cation).
