Pathogenesis Gut organisms invade the appendix wall after lumen obstruction by lymphoid hyperplasia, faecolith, or fi larial worms. This leads to oedema, ischaemic necrosis, and perforation. Presentation Classically periumbilical pain that moves to the RIF. Associated signs may include tachycardia, fever, peritonism with guarding and rebound or percussion tenderness in RIF.
