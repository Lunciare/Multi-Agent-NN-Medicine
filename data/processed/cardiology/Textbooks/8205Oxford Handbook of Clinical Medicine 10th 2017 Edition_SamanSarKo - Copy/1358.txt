profi les reduces the likelihood of resistance and toxicity. The drugs used should have: • cytotoxic activity for that tumour, preferentially able to induce remission • diff erent mechanisms of action, ideally additive or synergistic eff ects • non-overlapping toxicity to maximize benefi t of full therapeutic doses • diff erent mechanisms of resistance. • Adjuvant: After other initial treatment to reduce the risk of relapse, eg following surgical removal of, eg breast, bowel cancer. • Neoadjuvant: Used to shrink tumours prior to surgical or radiological treatment. May allow later treatment to be more conservative. • Palliative: No curative aim, off ers symptom relief, may prolong survival. Classes of cytotoxic drugs • Alkylating agents: Anti-proliferative drugs that bind via alkyl groups to DNA lead- ing to apoptotic cell death, eg cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, busulfan. • Angiogenesis inhibitors: Eg bevacizumab, afl ibercept, sunitinib. • Antimetabolites: Interfere with cell metabolism including DNA and protein synthe- sis, eg methotrexate, 5-fl uorouracil. • Antioestrogens: Aromatoase inhibitors (eg letrozole, anastrozole), oestrogen receptor antagonists (eg tamoxifen, raloxifene) used in breast cancer treatment. • Antitumour antibiotics: Interrupt DNA function, eg dactinomycin, doxorubicin, mitomycin, bleomycin. • Monoclonal antibodies: Antibodies to a specifi c tumour antigen can slow tumour growth
