progressive disease, nephrotic syn- drome, systemic disease, AKI without recovery. Biopsy is unlikely to change treat- ment if GFR stable and P:CR <150. DM with neuropathy/retinopathy may not need biopsy unless atypical, ie nephrotic, haematuria, other systemic symptoms. Monitoring renal function in CKD GFR and albuminuria should be monitored at least annually, according to risk. If high risk, monitor every 6 months (fi g 7.5, orange), if very high risk, monitor at least every 3–4 months (fi g 7.5, red). Small fl uctuations are common but a drop in eGFR stage with eGFR ≥ 25% is signifi cant. Rapid progression is eGFR >5/yr. Risk factors for decline: BP, DM, metabolic disturbance, volume depletion, infec- tion, NSAIDs, smoking. All CKD has risk of superimposed AKI and needs monitoring and prompt treatment during intercurrent illness. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 330033 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR 304 Chronic kidney disease (CKD): management CKD encompasses a range of disease from mild disease without progression to ad- vanced, symptomatic disease requiring renal replacement. Management of CKD6,8 requires: 1 Appropriate referral to nephrology. 2 Treatment to slow renal disease progression. 3 Treatment of renal complications ofC KD. 4 Treatment of other complications ofC KD. 5 Preparation for renal replacement therapy
