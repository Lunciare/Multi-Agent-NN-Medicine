• Narrow complex tachycardias (p806) in adults: consider metoprolol 5mg IV. • Hypertension can be treated with nifedipine 5–10mg PO or phentolamine 2–5mg IV. Treat hypotension conventionally (p790). • Hyperthermia: attempt to cool, if rectal T° >39°C consider dantrolene 1mg/kg IV (may need repeating: discuss with your senior and a poisons unit). Hyperthermia with ecstasy is akin to serotonin syndrome, and propranolol, muscle relaxation, and ventilation may be needed. Snakes (adders) Anaphylaxis: p794. Signs of envenoming: BP (vasodilation, vi- per cardiotoxicity); D&V; swelling spreading proximally within 4h of bite; bleeding gums or venepuncture sites; anaphylaxis; ptosis; trismus; rhabdomyolysis; pulmo- nary oedema. Tests: WCC; abnormal clotting; platelets; U&E; urine RBC; CK; PaO2, ECG. Management: Avoid active movement of aff ected limb (so use splints/slings). Avoid incisions and tourniquets. Get help from local/national poisons service. Is antivenom indicated (IgG from venom-immunized sheep)?—eg 10mL IV over 15min (adults and children) of European Viper Antiserum (from Monviato) for adder bites (see BNF);—20mL if severe envenoming have adrenaline to hand—p794. Monitor ECG. For non-UK endemic snakes, see BNF. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 884433 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 844 Paracetamol poisoning 12g (=24 tablets) or 150mg/kg in adults may be fatal. If the patient weighs >110kg, calculate ingested dose using
