proteinuria controlled to <1g/24h. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 332200 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR Cystinuria 321 1 in 17 000. Autosomal recessive defect prevents reabsorption of cystine and dibasic amino acids in proximal tubule. Leads to cystinuria and cystine stone formation. Treatment: diet, fl uid intake, and urine alkalinization. Current drugs which increase cystine solubility have adverse side-eff ect profi les. Cystinosis 1 in 100 000–200 000. Autosomal recessive. Lysosomal storage disorder with accumula- tion of cystine. In nephropathic forms causes proximal tubule dysfunction, Fanconi syndrome (p316), and progressive renal impairment. Also visual impairment, myopathy, hypothyroidism. Oral cysteamine intralysosomal cystine, and delays ESRF, but is poorly tolerated (GI symptoms, skin deposits, fever, seizures). Fig 7.14 A polycystic kidney (left) compared with a normal-sized kidney (right). The progressive increase in size can lead to abdominal discomfort. There may be haemorrhage into a cyst causing haematuria, or infection.
