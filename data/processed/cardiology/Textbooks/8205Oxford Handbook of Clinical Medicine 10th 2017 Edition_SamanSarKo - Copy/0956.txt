Complications of myeloma • Hypercalcaemia (p676). This occurs with active disease, eg at presenta- tion or r elapse. Rehydrate vigorously with IV saline 0.9% 4–6L/d (careful fl uid balance). IV bisphosphonates, eg zolendronate or pamidronate, are useful for treating hypercalcaemia acutely. • Spinal cord compression (p466). Occurs in 5% of
