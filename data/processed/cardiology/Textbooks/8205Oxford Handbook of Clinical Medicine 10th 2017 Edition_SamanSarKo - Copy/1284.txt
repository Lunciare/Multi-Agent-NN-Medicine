(p285), trauma (dementia pugilistica), encephalitis, neurosyphilis. Management Requires input of a a multidisc iplinary team (GP, neurologist, nurse specialist, social worker, carers, physio- and occupational therapist) to boost quality of life. Assess disability and cognition objectively and regu larly, and monitor mood— depression is common. Involve palliative care services early on. Postural exercises and weight lifting may help. Don’t forget the carers (p487): off er respite care. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 449944 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN Pharmacological therapy in Parkinson’s disease 495 A key decision is when to start supplementation of dopaminergic signalling with levodopa. Effi cacy of this therapy reduces with time, requiring larger and more frequent dosing, with worsening SEs and response fl uctuations (such as unpredictable freezing and pronounced end-of-dose reduced response: ~50% at 6yrs). Starting late may therefore be wise, eg when >70yrs or when PD seriously interferes with life: discuss pros and cons with the patient. Do not withdraw medication suddenly—risks acute akinesia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Be aware of situations where malabsorption could also have this eff ect (eg abdominal surgery, gastroenteritis). Levodopa: Dopamine precursor, given combined with a dopa-decarboxylase inhibi- tor in co-beneldopa or co-careldopa. SES: dyskinesia, painful dystonia. Non-motor SES: psychosis; visual hallucinations, nausea and vomiting
