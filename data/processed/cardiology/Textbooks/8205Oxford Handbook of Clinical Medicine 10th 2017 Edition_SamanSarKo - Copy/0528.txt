Dose adjustment for normal eating (DAFNE): Multidisciplinary teams promoting autonomy can save lives. DAFNE found that training in fl exible, intensive insulin dosing improved glycaemic control as well as well-being.9 It is resource intensive. Subcutaneous insulin dosing during intercurrent illnesses (eg infl uenza)  Advise patients to avoid stopping insulin during acute illness. • Illness often increases insulin requirements despite reduced food intake. • Maintain calorie intake, eg using milk. • Check blood glucose ≥ 4 times a day and look for ketonuria. Increase insulin doses if glucose rising. Advise to get help from a specialist diabetes nurse or GP if concerned (esp. if glucose levels are rising or ketonuria). One option is 2-hourly ultra fast-acting insulin (eg 6–8U) preceded by a fi ngerprick glucose check. • Admit if vomiting, dehydrated, ketotic (p832), a child, or pregnant. Insulin
