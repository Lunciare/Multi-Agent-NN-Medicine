No single suture fi ts the bill for every occasion, and so suture selection (including size) depends on the job in hand (see tables 13.2, 13.3). In their broadest sense they are absorbable or non-absorbable, synthetic or natural, and their structure may be divided into monofi lament, twisted, or braided. Monofi lament sutures are quite slippery but minimize infection and pro- duce less reaction. Braided sutures have plaited strands and provide secure knots, but they may allow infection to occur in surrounding tissue between their strands. Twisted sutures have 2 twisted strands and similar qualities to braided sutures. Sizes are denoted according to a scale running down from #5 (heavy braided suture). Most common modern sutures are smaller than size #0, hence rising numbers with a -0 suffi x correspond to progressively fi ner grades of suture up to 11–0 (fi ne ophthalmic monofi laments). 3–0
