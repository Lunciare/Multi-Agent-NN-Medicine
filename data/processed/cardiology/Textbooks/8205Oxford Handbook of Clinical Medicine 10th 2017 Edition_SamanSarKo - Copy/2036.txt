Prasugrel (60mg then 10mg/d PO) is an alternative to clopidogrel for those undergoing PCI. In practice, if the history is typi- cal but ECG changes are non-diagnostic and troponin results are awaited, treatment with eg clopridogrel is often given on clinical suspicion; if troponin testing then con- fi rms ACS, it is still appropriate to give either ticagrelor or prasugrel to those patients in whom it is indicated, even if clopidogrel has already been given. Anticoagulation: Ideally fondaparinux (factor Xa inhibitor) 2.5mg OD; if not avail- able, use low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH, eg enoxaparin 1mg/kg/12h) or un- fractionated heparin (aim APTT 50–70s) until discharge. ß-blockers: In higher-risk patients with no contraindications (consider diltiazem as alternative). Do not use -blockers with verapamil—can precipitate asystole. Nitrates (PO or IV): For recurrent chest pain. ACE-i: Should be given to all patients unless there are CI (monitor renal function). Lipid management: Start early, eg atorvastatin 80mg OD (see p120). Prognosis Overall risk of death ~1–2%, but ~15% for refractory angina despite medi- cal therapy. Risk stratifi cation can help predict those most at risk and allow interven- tion to be targeted at those individuals: calculate using GRACE score.2 The following are associated with an increased
