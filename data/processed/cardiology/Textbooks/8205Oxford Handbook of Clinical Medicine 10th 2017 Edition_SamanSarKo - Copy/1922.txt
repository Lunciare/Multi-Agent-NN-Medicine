9 are lower). If their distribution is Normal, then the median coincides with the mean. • Standard deviation (SD) is the square root of the variance (the average of the square of the distance of each data point from the mean). When the distribution of the observations is Normal, 95% of observations are located in the interval ‘mean ± 1.96 SD’. This is the basis of the reference interval. • Standard error of the mean gives an estimate of the reliability of the mean of a sample representing the mean of the population from which the sample was taken, and is the SD of the sample ÷ by the square root of the number of observations in the sample. Thus the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error of the mean—the basis of ensuring that clinical trial evidence is based upon enough observations to be confi dent that diff erences seen between groups do not occur by chance alone.
