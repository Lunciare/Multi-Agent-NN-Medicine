The degree of elevation is not related to severity of disease. Amylase may be normal even in severe pancreatitis (levels starts to fall within 24–48h). It is excreted renally so renal failure will  levels. Cholecystitis, mesenteric infarction, and GI perforation can cause lesser rises. Serum lipase is more sensitive and specifi c for pancreati tis (especially when related to alcohol), and rises earlier and falls later. ABG to monitor oxy genation and acid–base status.
