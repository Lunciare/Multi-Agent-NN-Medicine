Any fever lasting >1wk in those known to be at risk7 must prompt blood cultures.61 Acute infective endocarditis (IE) tends to occur on ‘normal’ valves and may present with acute heart failure ± emboli; the commonest organism is Staph. aureus. Risk factors: skin breaches (dermatitis, IV lines, wounds); renal failure; immunosuppression; DM. Mortality: 5–50% (related to age and embolic events). Endocarditis on abnormal valves tends to run a subacute course. Risk factors: aortic or mitral valve disease; tricuspid valves in IV drug users; coarctation; patent ductus arteriosus; VSD; prosthetic valves. Endocarditis on prosthetic valves may be ‘early’ (within 60d of surgery, usually Staph. epidermidis, poor prognosis) or ‘late’. Causes Bacteria: Bacteraemia occurs all the time, eg when we chew (not just during dentistry or medical interventions—which is why routine prophylaxis for such pro- cedures does not make sense). 61 Strep. viridans is the commonest (usually subacute) followed by Staph. aureus, Strep. bovis (need colonoscopy ?tumour), Enterococci and Coxiella burnetii. Rarely: HACEK
