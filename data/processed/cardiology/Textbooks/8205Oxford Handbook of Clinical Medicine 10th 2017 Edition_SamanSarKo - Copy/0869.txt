B12 helps synthesize thymidine, and hence DNA, so in defi ciency RBC production is slow. Untreated, it can lead to megaloblastic anaemia (p332) and irreversible CNS compli- cations.  Body stores of B12 are suffi cient for 4yrs. Causes of defi ciency • Dietary (eg vegans: B12 is found in meat, fi sh, and dairy products, but not in plants). • Malabs orption: during digestion, intrinsic factor (IF) in the stomach binds B12, enabling it to be absorbed in the terminal ileum. Malab- sorption can therefore arise in the stomach due to lack of IF (pernicious anaemia, post gastrectomy) or the terminal ileum (ileal resection, Crohn’s disease, bacterial overgrowth, tropical sprue, tapeworms). • Congenital metabolic errors. Features General: Symptoms of anaemia (p324), ‘lemon tinge’ to skin due to combination of pallor (anaemia) and mild jaundice (due to haemolysis), glossitis (beefy-red sore tongue; fi g 8.27), angular cheilosis (p326). Neuropsychiatric: Irritability, depression, psychosis, dementia. Neurological: Paraesthesiae, peripheral neuropathy.
