individualize risk and check local guidelines. In particular, check which criteria used to estimate degree of stenosis since NASCET (North American Sympto- matic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) criteria tend to include some more severe lesions in 50–69% range as compared to the ECST (European Carotid Surgery Trialists’ Collaborative Group) criteria. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 447766 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN When should TIA lead to emergency referral? 477 The ABCD2 score is a helpful tool to stratify which patients are at higher risk of hav- ing a stroke following a suspected TIA (table 10.6). Table 10.6 The ABCD2 score Age ≥60 yrs old 1 point Blood pressure ≥140/90 1 point Clinical features Unilateral weakness 2 points Speech disturbance without weakness 1 point Duration of symptoms Symptoms lasting ≥1h 2 points Symptoms lasting 10–59min 1 point Diabetes 1 point A score of ≥4 indicates that the patient is at high risk of an early stroke, and must be assessed by a specialist within 24h. A score of ≥6 strongly predicts a stroke (8 . 1% within 2 days, 35.5% in the next week). Other factors that suggest increased risk are: • AF • >1 TIA in a week • TIA while anticoagulated. Crucially, risk is lowest if
