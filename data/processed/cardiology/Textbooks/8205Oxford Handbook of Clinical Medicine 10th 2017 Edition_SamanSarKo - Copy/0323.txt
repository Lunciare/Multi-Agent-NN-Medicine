and increase slowly, monitoring pulse and BP. If contraindicated, consider verapamil or diltiazem. • ACE-i in patients with LV dysfunction, hypertension, or diabetes unless not tolerated (consider ARB). Titrate up slowly, monitoring renal function. • High-dose statin, eg atorvastatin 80mg. • Do an echo to assess LV function. Eplerenone improves outcomes in MI patients with heart failure (ejection fraction <40%). Revascularization • STEMI patients and very high-risk NSTEMI patients (eg haemodynamically unstable) should receive immediate angiography ± PCI. NSTEMI patients who are high risk (eg GRACE score >140) should have angiography within 24h; intermediate risk (eg GRACE 109–140) within 3d; low-risk patients may be considered for non-invasive testing. • Patients with multivessel disease may be considered for CABG instead of PCI (p123). Manage complications See p122. Discharge Address any questions the patient has. Discuss ‘red fl ag’ symptoms and where to seek medical advice should they arise. Ensure the management plan is communicated to the patient’s GP. Book clinic and cardiac rehab appointments. General advice • Driving:18 drivers with group 1 licences (car and motorcycle) can resume driving 1wk after successful angioplasty, or 4wk after ACS without successful angioplasty, if their ejection fraction is >40%. Group 2 licence holders must
