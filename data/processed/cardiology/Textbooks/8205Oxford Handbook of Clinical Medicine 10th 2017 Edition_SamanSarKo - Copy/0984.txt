linings are covered with bacteria. We rely on this for nutrition, functioning vitamin K, anti-infl ammatory eff ects, and immune system regulation. Bacterial disease results from a breach of the measures that limit bacteria to their ‘normal’ roles: skin commensals moved into the bloodstream by a cannula, an- tibiotics altering the commensal microfl ora, immune system evasion or dysfunction allowing organisms to stray beyond their usual boundaries, toxin production. When treating infections we should therefore remember to look beyond the off ending or- ganism and consider what factors may have aided pathogenesis: malnutrition, ‘bar- rier’ breach by cancer/plastic, immunosuppression. See ‘Sepsis’, p792. Bacterial glossary Bacteria: Prokaryotic micro-organism without a membrane-bound nucleus. Classifi cation of bacteria: By microscopy and culture of infected samples. Informs antibiotic choice. Includes: • Gram stain: a staining technique. Bacteria with thick, exposed peptidoglycan layers will stain ‘Gram positive’ (purple/blue). Bacteria with a protected peptidoglycan layer will counterstain pink/red and are ‘Gram negative’ (fi g 9.3). • Shape: cocci = round; bacilli = rod-shaped; spiro chaete = spiral. • Aerobes/anaerobes: some bacteria cannot sur- vive without oxygen (obligate aerobes), whilst others cannot grow in its presence (obligate an- aerobes). Many more can survive in either en- vironment
