rhexidine in 70% alcohol and wear sterile gloves, and, if conscious, use local an- aesthesia and sedation, eg with slow IV midazolam: titrate up to 3.5–5mg—start with 2mg over 1min, 0.5–1mg in elderly (in whom the maximum dose is 3.5mg; inject at the rate of 2mg/min)—antidote: fl umazenil 0.2mg IV over 15s, then 0.1mg every 60s, up to 1mg in total. Ensure you have IV access and full resuscitation equipment to hand. • Introduce needle at 45° to skin just below and to left of xiphisternum, aiming for tip of left scapula (fi g 18.15). Aspirate continuously and watch ECG. Frequent ventricular ectopics or an injury pattern (ST segment) on ECG imply that the myocardium has been breached—withdraw slightly. As soon as fl uid is obtained through the needle, slide the cannula into place. • Evacuate pericardial contents through the syringe and 3-way tap. Removal of only a small amount of fl uid (eg 20mL) can produce marked clinical improve- ment. If you are not sure whether the fl uid you are aspirating is pure blood (eg on entering a ventricle), see if it clots (heavily bloodstained pericardial fl uid does not clot), or measure its PCV (though this may
