cytochrome p450 isoenzymes so beware of drug interactions including macrolide antibiotics and anti- fungal drugs. Side eff ects: nephrotoxicity in the graft, modifi cation of CV risk factors: BP, cholesterol, NODAT (new-onset diabetes after transplantation). Antimetabolites: Eg mycophenolic acid (MPA), azathioprine. MPA is now used pref- erentially due to better prevention of acute rejection and graft survival (not in preg- nancy, MPA is teratogenic). Side eff ects: anaemia, leucopenia, and GI toxicity. Glucorticosteroids: Transcription of infl ammatory cytokines. First-choice treat- ment for acute rejection. Signifi cant side-eff ects (BP, hyperlipidaemia, DM, impaired wound healing, osteoporosis, cataracts, skin fragility) have led to protocols with ear- ly withdrawal of steroids and the use of steroid-free immunosuppression regimens. Complications Surgical: Bleed, thrombosis, infection, urinary leaks, lymphocele, hernia. Delayed graft function: Aff ects up to 40% of grafts, more common in DCD. Rejection: Acute or chronic. Acute is divided into antibody mediated (rare un- less known pre-sensitized recipient) or cellular (most common). Causes renal function, diagnosed on graft biopsy. Treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppression. Chronic antibody-mediated rejection causes progressive dys- function of the graft. Most graft loss is now thought to be due to an immune re- sponse by donor-specifi c antibodies causing
