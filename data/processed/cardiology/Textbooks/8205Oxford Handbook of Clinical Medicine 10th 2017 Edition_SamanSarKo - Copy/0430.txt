artery is used less because of median nerve proximity and it is an end artery. pH, PaO2, PaCO2, HCO 3 are measured using an auto- mated analyser. ABG interpretation See pp188–9. Spirometry (See table 4.1) Measures functional lung volumes. Forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) are measured from a full forced ex- piration into a spirometer (Vitalograph®); exhalation continues until no more breath can be exhaled. FEV1 is less eff ort-dependent than PEF. The FEV1/FVC ratio gives a good estimate of the severity of airfl ow obstruction; and helps classify COPD severity. Ob- structive defect: (fi g 4.3) Asthma, bronchiectasis, COPD, cystic fi brosis. Restrictive defect: Fibrosis, sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, interstitial pneumonias, connective tis sue diseases, pleural eff usion, obesity, kyphoscoliosis, neuromuscular problems. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 116622 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem tsehC Table 4.1 Spirometry results (data source NICE COPD 2010 guidelines) 163 FEV1 FVC FEV1/FVC ratio Normal >80% predicted >80% predicted 75–80% Restrictive <80% predicted <80% predicted >70% normal Obstructive <80% predicted Normal or low <70% predicted Fig 4.3 Examples of spirograms. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 116633 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem tsehC 164 Further investigations in chest medicine Lung function tests PEF, FEV1, FVC (see p162).
