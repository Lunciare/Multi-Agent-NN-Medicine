direct contact, infected fomites, airborne droplets. Presentation: Coryza, pharyngitis, croup, bronchiolitis, pneumonia. Diagnosis: Clinical. Viral culture, antigen detection, PCR. Treatment: None in uncomplicated disease/immu- nocompetent. Limited evidence for specifi c treatments in high-risk complicated disease, immunosuppression: cidofovir for adenovirus; aerosolized ribavarin, im- munoglobulin, monoclonal antibody in RSV. For infl uenza see pp396–7. Human papilloma virus (HPV) >120 HPVs. Pathology: • Skin warts, verrucas (HPV 1, 2). Treatment: none, topical salicylic acid, freezing. • Anogenital warts (HPV 6, 11).

Polyomavirus ~100% exposure. Disease only with immunosuppression: BK virus causes renal trans- plant nephropathy; JC virus causes progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy. Measles Transmitted by respiratory droplets. Incubation 10–18d. Highly contagious: >95% population cov- erage needed for ‘herd’ immunity. Presentation: Prodrome (2–4d): fever, conjunctivitis, coryza, di- arrhoea, Koplik spots (white spots on red buccal mucosa, fi g 9.15). Then generalized, maculopapu- lar rash, classically face/necktrunklimbs (fi g 9.16).
