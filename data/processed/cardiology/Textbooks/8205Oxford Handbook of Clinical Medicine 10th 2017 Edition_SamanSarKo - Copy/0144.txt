patient’s ability to tolerate antico- agulation. Three mechanical valve designs exist: the caged ball valve, the tilting disc (single leafl et) valve, and the bileafl et valve. Tissue valves are made from porcine valves or bovine pericardium. Prosthetic aortic valves: All types produce a degree of outfl ow obstruction and thus have an ESM. The intensity of this murmur increases as the valve fails. Ball and cage valves (eg Starr–Edwards) and tissue valves do close completely in diastole and so any diastolic murmur implies valve failure. Prosthetic mitral valves: Ball and cage valves project into the left ventricle and can cause a low-intensity ESM as they interfere with the ejected stream. Tissue valves and bileafl et valves can have a low-intensity diastolic murmur. Consider any systolic murmur of loud intensity to be a sign of regurgitation and  failure. Eponymous signs of aortic regurgitation • de Musset’s sign—head nodding in time with the pulse. • Müller’s sign—systolic pulsations of the uvula. • Corrigan’s sign—visible carotid pulsations. • Quincke’s sign—capillary nailbed pulsation in the fi ngers. • Traube’s sign—‘pistol shot’ femorals, a booming sound heard over the femorals. • Duroziez’s sign—to and fro diastolic murmur heard when compressing the femo- rals
