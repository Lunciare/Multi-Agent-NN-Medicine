The key decisions 1 Is it obstruction of the small or large bowel? In small bowel obstruction, vomiting occurs early, distension is less, and pain is higher in the abdomen; in large bowel obstruction, pain is more constant. The AXR plays a key role (fi g 13.28 & p728). 2 Is there an ileus or mechanical obstruction? Ileus is functional obstruction from bowel motility (see BOX ‘Paralytic ileus or pseudo-obstruction?’ & p728). Bowel sounds are absent; pain tends to be less. 3 Is the obstructed bowel simple/closed loop/strangulated? Simple: one obstruct- ing point and no vascular compromise. Closed loop: obstruction at two points (eg sigmoid volvulus)
