is the change in keeping with the pH? • HCO3Ω is alkaline—is HCO3Ω raised with an alkalosis, lowered with an acidosis? If so, the problem is a metabolic one. 4 Is the PO abnormal? Interpret in the context of the FiO. a 2 2 An example Your patient’s blood gas shows: pH 7.05, CO2 2.0kPa, HCO3Ω 8.0mmol/L. There is an acidosis. The CO2 is low, and thus it is a compensatory change. The HCO3Ω is low and is thus the primary change, ie a metabolic acidosis. The anion gap Estimates unmeasured plasma anions (‘fi xed’ or organic acids such as phosphate, ketones, and lactate—hard to measure directly). It is calculated as the diff erence between plasma cations (Na+ and K+) and anions (ClΩ and HCO3Ω). Normal range: 10–18mmol/L. It is helpful in determining the cause of a metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis pH, HCO3Ω Causes of metabolic acidosis and an increased anion gap: Due to increased production, or reduced excretion, of fi xed/organic acids. HCO3Ω falls and unmeasured anions associated with the acids accumulate. • Lactic acid (shock, infection, tissue ischaemia). • Urate (renal failure). • Ketones (diabetes mellitus, alcohol). • Drugs/toxins (salicylates, biguanides, ethylene glycol, methanol).
