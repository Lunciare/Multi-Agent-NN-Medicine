tissue, calcifi cation, or gas), then everything deep to it will be in a low intensity (black) acoustic shadow. If a lower-than-average attenuation object (eg fl uid-fi lled/ cystic structure) is in the superfi cial tissues then everything deep to it will be high intensity (white) or enhanced. If a tissue interface is strongly disparate, eg gas in the intestine, then all the waves are refl ected back, making it impossible to image beyond it. See also fi gs 16.21–16.24. Modes B: (Brightness) is the most common, giving 2D slices that map the diff erent magnitudes of echo in greyscale. M: (Movement) traces the movement of structures within the line of the sound beam. It is used in imaging, eg heart valves (p110). Duplex ultrasonography (fl ow and morphology) By combining Doppler eff ects (shifts in wavelength caused by movement of a source or refl ecting surface) with B-mode ultrasound technology, fl ow characteristics of blood can be inferred (fi g 16.21). This is extremely useful in arterial and venous studies, and echocardiography. Advantages Portable; fast; non-ionizing; cheap; real-time; can be used with interven- tion; can enter organs, eg rectum, vagina, bowel. Endoscopic US can be used to stage and
