severe disease/immunosuppression: observational data on the use of antivirals and steroids. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) (human herpesvirus 5) 50–100% of adults are seropositive depending on socioeconomic and sexual risk. Latent infection: periodic, asymptomatic (but infectious) viral shedding in bodily fl u- ids including blood transfusion, transplantation (CMV+ve donor to CMVΩve recipient). Presentation: Asymptomatic in most. Symptoms mimic infectious mononucleosis (see earlier in topic) or hepatitis. Severe disease in immunosuppressed (post-trans- plantation, HIV): oesophagitis, gastritis, colitis, retinitis (p438), pneumonitis, hepati- tis. Infection in pregnancy is associated with congenital abnormality. Diagnosis: Primary infection in immunocompetent: IgM. Immunosuppressed: quan- titative nucleic acid amplifi cation testing (QNAT) in blood greater than a defi ned threshold, or rising titre. Invasive disease: tissue QNAT, histopathology. Treatment: Given in severe infection/immunosuppression. Ganciclovir, valganci- clovir (oral bioavailability). Foscarnet and cidofovir: nephrotoxicity limit use. Pre- emptive treatment in transplant patients based on QNAT results. Risk/benefi t for antivirals/immunoglobulin in pregnancy remains unclear. Use CMVΩve, irradiated blood for transfusion if immunosuppressed and at risk: transplant, HIV, leukaemia. Other herpes viruses Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6): Roseola infantum, febrile illness without rash. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8): Oncogenic (see BOX ‘Oncogenic viruses’), Castleman’s disease. Oncogenic viruses ~12% of human cancers are caused by viruses, >80%
