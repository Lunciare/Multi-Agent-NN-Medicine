route is impossible, try lorazepam IM. • Vitamins: vit K: 10mg/d IV for 3d. Thiamine 100mg/d PO (high-dose B vitamins can also be given IV as Pabrinex®—1 pair of ampoules in 50mL 0.9% saline IVI over ½h). • Optimize nutrition (35–40kcal/kg/d non-protein energy). Use ideal body weight for calculations, eg if malnourished. • Don’t use low-protein diets even if severe encephalopathy is present. Give >1.2g/ kg/d of protein; this prevents encephalopathy, sepsis, and some deaths. • Daily weight; LFT; U&E; INR. If creatinine , get help with this—HRS (p275). Na+ is common, but water restriction may make matters worse. • Steroids may confer benefi t in those with severe disease. The Maddrey Discrimi- nant Factor (DF) = (4.6 ≈ patient’s prothrombin time in sec – control time) + bilirubin (μmol/L) roughly refl ects mortality. If Maddrey score >31 and encephalopathy then consider prednisolone 40mg/d for 5d tapered over 3wks. CI: sepsis; variceal bleed- ing. The largest study to date (STOPAH) showed only a non-signifi cant trend towards benefi t with this regimen. Prognosis: Mild episodes hardly aff ect mortality; if severe, mortality ≈ 50% at 30d. 1yr after admission for alcoholic hepatitis, 40% are dead...a sobering thought. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 228811 0022//0055//22001177
