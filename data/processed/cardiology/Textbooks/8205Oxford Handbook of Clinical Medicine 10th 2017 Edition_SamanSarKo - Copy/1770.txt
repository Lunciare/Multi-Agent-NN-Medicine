and bony deformity and enlargement—typically of the pelvis, lumbar spine, skull, femur, and tibia (clas- sically a bowed sabre tibia; fi g 14.11). Complications include pathological fractures, osteoa rthritis, Ca2+, nerve compression due to bone overgrowth (eg deafness, root compression), high-output CCF (if >40% of skeleton involved), and osteosarcoma (<1% of those aff ected for >10yrs—suspect if sudden onset or worsening of bone pain).19 Radiology X-ray Localized enlargement of bone. Patchy cortical thickening with sclerosis, osteolysis, and deformity (eg osteoporosis circumscripta of the skull). Af- fi nity for axial skeleton, long bones, and skull. Bone scan may reveal ‘hot spots’. Blood chemistry Ca2+ and PO43Ω normal; ALP markedly raised. Treatment If analgesia fails, alendronic acid may be tried to reduce pain and/or deformity. It is more eff ective than etidronate or calcitonin, and as eff ective as IV pamidronate. Follow expert advice. Fig 14.10 Rickets. Typical ragged meta- physeal surfaces are seen in the knee and ankle joints of a child with rickets, with bowing of the long bones. Image courtesy of Dr Ian Maddison. Fig 14.9 Osteomalacia.
