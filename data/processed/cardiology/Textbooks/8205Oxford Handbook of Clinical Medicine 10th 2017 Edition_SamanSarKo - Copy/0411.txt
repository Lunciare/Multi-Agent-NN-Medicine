if eff usion >300mL; fi g 3.14. ECG shows low-voltage QRS complexes and may have alternating QRS morphologies (elec- trical alternans). Echocardi ography shows an echo-free zone surrounding the heart. Management: Treat the cause. Pericardiocentesis may be diagnostic (suspected bacterial pericarditis) or therapeutic (cardiac tamponade). See p773. Send pericar- dial fl uid for culture, ZN stain/TB culture, and cytology. Constrictive pericarditis The heart is encased in a rigid pericardium.68 Causes: Often unknown (UK); elsewhere TB, or after any pericarditis. Clinical features: These are mainly of right heart failure with JVP (with prominent x and y descents, p43); Kussmaul’s sign (JVP rising paradoxically with inspiration); soft, diff use apex beat; quiet heart sounds; S3; diastolic pericardial knock, hepato- splenomegaly, ascites, and oedema. Tests: CXR: small heart ± pericardial calcifi cation. CT/MRI—helps distinguish from re- strictive cardiomyopathy. Echo. Cardiac catheterization. Management: Surgical excision. Medical  to address the cause and symptoms. Cardiac tamponade A pericardial eff usion that raises intrapericardial pressure, reducing ventricular fi lling and thus dropping cardiac output.68  Can lead rapidly to cardiac arrest. Signs: Pulse, BP, pulsus paradoxus, JVP, Kussmaul’s sign, muffl ed S1 and S2. Diagnosis: Beck’s triad: falling BP; rising JVP; muffl ed heart sounds. ECG:
