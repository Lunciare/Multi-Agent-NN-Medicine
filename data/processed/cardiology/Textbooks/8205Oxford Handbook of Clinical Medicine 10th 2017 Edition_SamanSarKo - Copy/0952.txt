Lawrence. Fig 8.69 Marrow trephine in myelo fi brosis: the streaming eff ect is caused by intense fi - brosis. Other causes of marrow fi brosis: any myeloprolife rative disorder, lymphoma, second- ary carcinoma, TB, leukaemia, and irradiation. © Prof. Christine Lawrence. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 336677 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 368 Myeloma: the chief plasma cell dyscrasia (PCD) PCDS are due to an abnormal proliferation of a single clone of plasma or lympho- plasmacytic cells leading to secretion of immunoglobulin (Ig) or an Ig fragment, causing the dysfunction of many organs (esp kidney).The Ig is seen as a monoclonal band, or paraprotein, on serum or urine electrophoresis (see later in topic). Classifi cation Based on Ig product—IgG in ~ ⅔; IgA in ~ ⅓; a very few are IgM or IgD. Other Ig levels are low (‘immunoparesis’, causing susceptibility to infection). In ~ ⅔, urine contains Bence Jones proteins, which are free Ig light chains of kappa (κ) or lambda (λ) type, fi ltered by the kidney. Incidence 5/100 000. Peak age: 70yrs. :  ≈ 1:1. Afro-Caribbeans:Caucasians ≈ 2:1. Clinical features • Osteolytic bone lesions cause backache, pathological fractures and vertebral collapse. Do serum electrophoresis on all >50 with new back pain.
