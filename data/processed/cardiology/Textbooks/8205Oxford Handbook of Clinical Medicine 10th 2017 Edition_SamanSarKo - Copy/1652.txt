extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) (if <1cm), or ureteros- copy using a basket. ESWL: US waves shatter stone. SE: renal injury, may also cause BP and DM. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL): keyhole surgery to remove stones, when large, multiple, or complex. Open surgery is rare. Indications for urgent intervention (delay kills glomeruli): Presence of infec- tion and obstruction—a percutaneous nephr ostomy or ureteric stent may be needed to relieve obstruction (p640); urosepsis; intractable pain or vomiting; impending AKI; obstruction in a solitary kidney; bilateral obstructing stones. Prevention General: Drink plenty. Normal dietary Ca2+ intake (low Ca2+ diets in- crease oxalate excretion). Specifi cally: •Calcium stones: in hypercalciuria, a thiazide diuretic is used to Ca2+ excretion. •Oxalate: oxalate intake; pyridoxine may be used (p295). •Struvite (phosphate mineral): treat infection promptly. •Urate: allopurinol (100–300mg/24h PO). Urine alkalinization may also help, as urate is more soluble at pH>6 (eg with potassium citrate or sodium bicarbonate). •Cystine: vigorous hydra- tion to keep urine output >3L/d and urinary alkalinization (as above-mentioned). Penicillamine is used to chelate cystine, given with pyridoxine to prevent vitamin B6 defi ciency. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 663388 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Questions to address when confronted by a stone 639 What is its composition?
