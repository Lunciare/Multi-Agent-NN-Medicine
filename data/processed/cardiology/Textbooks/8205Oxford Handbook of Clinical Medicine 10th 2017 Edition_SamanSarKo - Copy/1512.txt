≈nephrotic syndrome). CCF? Treatment of leg oedema Treat the cause. Diuretics for all is not an answer. Elevat- ing legs for dependent oedema (ankles higher than hips—do not just use footstools); raise the foot of the bed. Graduated support stockings may help (CI: ischaemia). Travel and DVT Long-distance travel appears to be a risk factor for the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Data suggests this is not confi ned to air travel, increases with the duration of travel, and results in clinical thrombosis more often in travel- lers with pre-existing risk factors. Dehydration, immobilization, decreased oxygen tension, and prolonged sitting have all been suggested as contributory factors. The risk of developing a DVT from a long-distance fl ight has been estimated at 1 in 10 000 to 1 in 40 000 for the general population. • The incidence of DVT in high-risk groups has been shown to be 4–6% for fl ights >10h. Travellers with ≥1 risk factor should consider compression stockings. For high-risk individuals consider a single dose of prophylactic LMWH for fl ights >6h. • There is risk of PE associated with long-distance air travel. • Compression stockings may  risk of DVT. • There is no evidence
