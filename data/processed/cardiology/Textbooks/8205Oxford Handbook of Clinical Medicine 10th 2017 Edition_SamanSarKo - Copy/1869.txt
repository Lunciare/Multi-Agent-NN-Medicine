lung diseases (silicosis, asbestosis). • Malignancy (lymphangitis carcinomatosa). Alveolar opacifi cation: = Airspace opacifi cation, can be due to any material fi lling the alveoli: • Pus—pneumonia. • Blood—haemorrhage, DIC (p352). • Water—heart, renal, or liver failure (p302, p274), ARDS (p186), smoke inhalation (p847), drugs (heroin), O 2 toxicity, near drowning (OHCS p768). • Cells—lymphoma, adenocarcinoma. • Protein—alveolar proteinosis, ARDS, fat emboli (~7d post fracture). ‘Ring’ opacities: Either airways seen end-on (bronchitis; bronchiectasis) or cavitat- ing lesions, eg abscess (bacterial, fungal, amoebic), tumour, or pulmonary infarct (wedge-shaped with a pleural base). Linear opacities: Septal lines (Kerley B lines, ie interlobular lymphatics seen with fl uid, tumour, or dusts); atelectasis; pleural plaques (asbestos exposure). White-out of whole hemithorax: (fi g 16.4) Pneumonia, large pleural eff usion, ARDS, post-pneumonectomy. Gas outside the lungs Check for a pneumothorax (hard to spot if apical or in a supine image, can you see vascular markings right out to the periphery?), surgical emphysema (trauma, iatrogenic), and gas under the diaphragm (surgery, perforated viscus, trauma). Pneumomediastinum: Air tracks along mediastinum, into the neck. Due to rupture of alveolar wall (eg asthma or pulmonary barotrauma) or bronchial or oesophageal trauma (can be iatrogenic, eg from endoscope). Pneumopericar- dium:
