skin scrapings. Treatment: All superfi cial mycos- es: topical ‘-azole’ antifungal or terbinafi ne 1–4wk. Also topical nystatin and ampho- tericin in superfi cial candidiasis. Tinea capitis: griseofulvin, terbinafi ne, itraconazole. Nail infection requires systemic treatment (terbinafi ne, itraconazole) confi rm diag- nosis, and caution re side-eff ects including hepatotoxicity. Systemic/invasive mycoses • Invasive candidiasis: Typically occurs in immunocompr omised, comorbidity, or ITU settings. Genetic susceptibility likely contributes. Estimated 250 000/yr with 50 000 deaths. Candidaemia in ~7/1000 ICU patients. Presentation: Risk factors for invasive fungal disease (see p409), febrile with no microbiological evidence of infec- tion, new murmur, muscle tenderness, skin nodules. Diagnosis: (Repeated) blood/ tissue culture. PCR. Candida in respiratory secretions alone is insuffi cient. Treat- ment: Remove all possible catheters. Echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, micafungin), fl uconazole, amphotericin (liposomal for renal toxicity). Consider fl uconazole prophylaxis if risk factors for invasive disease (p403). Consider em- pirical treatment if persistent fever, unresponsive to other therapy (discuss with microbiologist, choice depends on local epidemiology, comorbidity). • Cryptococcus: See HIV p400. Causes meningitis, pneumonia. Presentation: Usu- ally immunosuppression, eg HIV, sarcoid, Hodgkin’s, haematological malignancy, post-transplant. History may be long, non-specifi c. Headache, confusion, ataxia, focal neurological signs, fever, cough, pleuritic pain,
