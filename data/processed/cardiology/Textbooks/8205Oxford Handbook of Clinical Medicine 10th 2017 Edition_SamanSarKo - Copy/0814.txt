GBM allow an infl ux of infl ammatory cells so that crescents are seen on renal biopsy (may be referred to as crescentic GN) (fi g 7.12). Treatment: Corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. Other treatments depend on aetiology eg plasma exchange for anti-GBM/ANCA vasculitis, possible role for monoclonal antibodies in lupus nephritis.

Defi nition The nephrotic syndrome is a triad of: • proteinuria >3g/24h (P:CR >300mg/mmol, A:CR >250mg/mmol, p294) • hypoalbuminaemia (usually <30g/L, can be <10g/L) • oedema. Aetiology Primary renal disease or secondary to a systemic disorder. • Primary renal disease: Minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy (may be associated with underlying infl ammation/malignancy), focal segmental glo- merulosclerosis (FSGS), membranoproliferative GN. • Secondary causes: DM, lupus nephritis,
