detrusor muscle contracts. Urgency/leaking is precipitated by: arriving home (latchkey incontinence, a conditioned refl ex); cold; the sound of running water; caf- feine; and obesity.  : urodynamic studies. Cause: detrusor overactivity (see table 13.20), eg from central inhibitory pathway malfunction or sensitization of peripher- al aff erent terminals in the bladder; or a bladder muscle problem. Check for organic brain damage (eg stroke; Parkinson’s; dementia). Other causes: urinary infection; diabetes; diuretics; atrophic vaginitis; urethritis. In both sexes incontinence may result from confusion or sedation. Occasionally it may be purposeful (eg preventing admission to an old people’s home) or due to anger. Management Eff ective treatment can have a huge impact on quality of life. Check for: UTI; DM; diuretic use; faecal impaction; palpable bladder; GFR. • Stress incontinence: Pelvic fl oor exercises are 1st line (8 contractions ≈3/d for 3 months). Intravaginal electrical stimulation may also be eff ective, but is not acceptable to many women. A ring pessary may help uterine prolapse, eg while awaiting surgical repair. Surgical options (eg tension-free vaginal tape) aim to sta- bilize the mid-urethra. Urethral bulking also available. Medical options: duloxetine 40mg/12h PO (50% have ≥50%  in incontinence episodes). SE = nausea.
