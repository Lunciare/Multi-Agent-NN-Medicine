See p802. • Hypovolaemic shock: Identify and treat underlying cause. Raise the legs. • Give fl uid bolus 10–15mL/kg crystalloid via large peripheral line, if shock improves, repeat, titrate to HR (aim <100), BP (aim SBP >90) and UO (aim >0.5mL/kg/h). • If no improvement after 2 boluses, consider referral to ICU. • Haemorrhagic shock: Stop bleeding if possible. See table 19.2 for grading. • If still shocked despite 2L crystalloid or present with class III/IV shock then crossmatch blood (request O Rh–ve in an emergency, see p348). • Give FFP with red cells (1 : 1 ratio); aim for platelets >100 and fi brinogen >1 (guided by results, but eg 1 pool of platelets and 2 pools of cryoprecipitate per 6–8 units of red cells). Consider tranexamic acid 2g IV. Discuss with haematology early. • Heat exposure (heat exhaustion): • Tepid sponging + fanning; avoid ice and immersion. Resuscitate with IVI, eg 0.9% saline ± hydrocortisone 100mg IV. Lorazepam 1–2mg IV or chlorpromazine 25mg IM/IV may be used to stop shivering. Stop cooling when core temperature <39°C. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 779900 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE Table 19.2 Categorizing shock 791  Class of shock 1 2 3 4 Blood loss (estimated mL
