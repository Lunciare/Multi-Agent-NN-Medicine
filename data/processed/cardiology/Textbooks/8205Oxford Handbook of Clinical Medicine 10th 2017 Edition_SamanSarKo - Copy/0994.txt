-lactam antibiotics. Seek expert microbiol- ogy advice before use. Monobactam: Aztreonam is only active against Gram-negative species including Neisseria men- ingitidis, Haemophilus infl uenzae, Pseudomonas. Given IV/IM. Inhaled preparation for chronic pulmonary Pseudomonas (cystic fi brosis). Dose adjust for renal function. SEs: N&V, GI bleed, rash, LFTS, plts, paraesthesia, seizures, bronchospasm. Non--lactam cell wall inhibitors See fi g 9.4 and table 9.6. Includes glycopeptides, eg vancomycin, teicoplanin, and polymyxins, eg colistin. Inhibitors of protein synthesis See fi g 9.4 and table 9.7. Includes: • aminoglycosides • macrolides • tetracyclines and derivatives of tetracycline • others: clindamycin, linezolid, chloramphenicol, fusidic acid. Inhibitors of nucleic acid synthesis See fi g 9.4 and table 9.8. Includes: • folate synthesis inhibitors: trimethoprim, co-trimoxazole • fl uoroquinolones • others: metronidazole, rifampicin. Nitrofurantoin is unique. Metabolites interfere with cell growth via ribosomes, DNA, RNA, and cell wall. Multiple sites of attack means resistance. Concentrates in the urine (but not if GFR), used in uncomplicated UTI. SES: haemolysis, pulmonary fi brosis, hepatotoxicity. Antibiotics for TB, see pp394–5. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 338855 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI 386 Antibiotics: summary tables Table 9.3 Penicillins Antibiotic Indications Considerations Penicillin G Gram +ve: streptococci (chest, Give IV, poor oral absorp- (benzylpenicillin, throat, endocarditis,
