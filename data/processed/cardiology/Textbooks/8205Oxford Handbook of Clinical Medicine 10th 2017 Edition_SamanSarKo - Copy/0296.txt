It not only demonstrates anatomy but also provides a continuous display of the functioning heart throughout its cycle. Types of scan M-mode (motion mode): A single-dimension image. Two-dimensional (real time): A 2D, fan-shaped image of a segment of the heart is produced on the screen (fi g 3.17); the moving image may be ‘frozen’. Several views are possible, including long axis, short axis, 4-chamber, and subcostal. 2D echocar- diography is good for visualizing conditions such as: congenital heart disease, LV aneurysm, mural thrombus, LA myxoma, septal defects. 3D echocardiography: Now possible with matrix array probes, and is termed 4D (3D + time) if the images are moving. Doppler and colour-fl ow echocardiography: Diff erent coloured jets illustrate fl ow and gradients across valves and septal defects (p156) (Doppler eff ect, p736). Tissue Doppler imaging: This employs Doppler ultrasound
