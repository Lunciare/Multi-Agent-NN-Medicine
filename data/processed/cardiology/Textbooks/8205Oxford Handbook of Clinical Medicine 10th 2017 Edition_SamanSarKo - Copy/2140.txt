Handbook of Clinical medicine

Treatment Use ABCDE approach (p779)—but don’t expose to cold. • All patients should receive warm, humidifi ed O2; ventilate if comatose or respira- tory insuffi ciency. • Remove wet clothing, slowly rewarm, aiming for rise of ½°C/h (check temperature, BP, HR, and respiratory rate every 30min) using blankets or active external warm- ing (hot air duvets). If T° rising too quickly stop and allow to cool slightly. Rapid rewarming causes peripheral vasodilation and shock. A falling BP can be a sign of too rapid warming. • Warm IVI. • Cardiac monitor is essential (AF, VF, and VT can occur at any time during rewarming or on stimulation). • Consider antibiotics for the prevention of pneumonia (p166). Give these routinely in patients over 65yrs with T° <32°C. • Consider urinary catheter (to monitor renal function). NB: in sudden hypothermia from immersion or profound hypothermia with cardiovas- cular instability/cardiac arrest, the temperature needs to be raised rapidly. Options include warmed fl uid lavage (intravesical, nasogastric, intrapleural, intraperitoneal) and intravascular warming (cardiopulmonary bypass, dialysis). In the event of car- diac arrest, defi brillation is usually unsuccessful if T° <30°C (consider amiodarone, bretylium). Resuscitation must continue until core T° >33°C (OHCS p786).
