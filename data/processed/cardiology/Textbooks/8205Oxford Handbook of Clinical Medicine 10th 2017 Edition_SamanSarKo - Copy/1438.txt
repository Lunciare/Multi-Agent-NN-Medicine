ongoing.41 Monitor BP and renal function. Regular ACE-i or A2RBS  risk of renal crisis (p314). Raynaud’s phenomenon: (see p708). Mixed connective tissue disease Combines features of systemic sclerosis, SLE, and polymyositis and the presence of high titres of anti-U1-RNP antibodies. Relapsing polychondritis Rare condition with recurrent episodes of cartilage infl am- mation and destruction. Aff ects pinna (fl oppy ears), nasal septum, larynx (stridor), tracheobronchial tree (infections), and joints. Associations: Aortic valve disease, poly- arthritis, and vasculitis. 30% have underlying rheumatic or autoimmune disease. Di- agnosis is clinical. : Steroids, DMARDS or CPAP/tracheostomy for airway involvement. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis Rare conditions characterized by insidious onset of progressive symmetrical proxi- mal muscle weakness and autoimmune-mediated striated muscle infl ammation (myositis), associated with myalgia ± arthralgia. Muscle weakness may also cause dysphagia, dysphonia (ie poor phonation, not dysphasia), or respiratory weakness. The myositis (esp. in dermatomyositis) may be a paraneoplastic phenomenon, com- monly from lung, pancreatic, ovarian, or bowel malignancy. Screen for cancers. Dermatomyositis Myositis plus skin signs: •Macular rash (shawl sign is +ve if over back and shoulders). •Lilac-purple (heliotrope) rash on eyelids often with oedema (fi g 12.26, p563). •Nailfold erythema (dilated capillary loops). •Gottron’s papules: roughened red papules
