position in the cardiac cycle (best when the patient is in sinus rhythm) can reduce movement artefact and lead to excellent resolution images for functional assess- ment. This, coupled with a lack of radiation, makes it ideal for the assessment of a wide range of structural and functional heart diseases. Flow velocities can be measured and, because the fl ow is proportional to the pressure diff erences, degrees of stenosis and regurgitation across heart valves can be calculated. Myocardial in- farction, perfusion, and viability can also be imaged with the use of IV gadolinium contrast (p748). Vascular MRI is used to limit radiation exposure where multiple investigations may be required over a long time period, eg follow-up of intracranial aneurysm coiling, aortic root size in a young patient with Marfan’s syndrome (p706), or Takayasu’s arteritis (p712). Ultrasound Non-invasive, relatively low cost, and with no radiation, US is excellent for assessing the heart and vasculature particularly in acute settings where the test can be performed at the bedside. Cardiac US (=echocardiography) evaluates myocardial and valvular anatomy and function (p110). The use of exercise or pharma- cological agents for ‘stress echocardiography’ can permit more detailed functional assessment. Vascular US Doppler ultrasonography is
