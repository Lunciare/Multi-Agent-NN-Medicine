ygoloretneortsaG 272 Jaundice Jaundice refers to yellowing of skin, sclerae, and mucosae from plasma bilirubin (visible at 60μmol/L fi g 6.24). Jaundice is classifi ed by the site of the problem (pre- hepatic, hepatocellular, or cholestatic/obs tructive) or by the type of circulating bili- rubin (conjugated or unconj ugated, fi g 6.25). Unconjugated hyperbilir ubinaemia As unconjugated bilirubin is water-insoluble, it does not enter urine, resulting in unconjugated hyperbilir ubinaemia. Overproduction: Haemolysis (p338, eg malaria/DIC, etc); ineff ective erythropoiesis. Impaired hepatic uptake: Drugs (paracetamol, rifampicin), ischaemic hepatitis. Impaired conjugation: Eponymous syndromes: Gilbert’s, p700; Crigler–Najjar, p696. Physiological neonatal jaundice: Caused by a combination of the above, OHCS p115. Conjugated hyperbili rubinaemia As conjugated bilirubin is water-soluble, it is excreted in urine, making it dark. Less conjugated bilirubin enters the gut and the faeces become pale. When severe, it can be associated with an intractable pruri- tus which is best treated by relief of the obstruction. Hepatocellular dysfunction: There is hepatocyte damage, usually with some chole- stasis. Causes: Viruses: hepatitis (p278), CMV (p405), EBV (p405); drugs (see ta- ble 6.10); alcohol; cirrhosis (see BOX ‘Causes of jaundice’); liver metastases/abscess; haemo chromatosis; autoimmune hepatitis (AIH); septicaemia; leptospirosis; syphilis; 1-anti trypsin defi ciency (p290);
