treatment One size does not fi t all! Aim to tailor therapy to the exact gene defect, and according to individual metabolism. Monoclonal antibodies, gene-targeted retinoids, cytokines, vaccines, and T-cell infusions are relevant here. Biomarkers, eg thiopurine methyltransferase, can predict toxicity from thiopurines. 6 Eg t(12:21) ETV6-RUNX1, t(1;19) TCF3-PBX1, t(9;22) BCR-ABL1, and rearrangement of MLL. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 335544 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 355 Fig 8.45 Blood fi lm in ALL, L1 subtype.
