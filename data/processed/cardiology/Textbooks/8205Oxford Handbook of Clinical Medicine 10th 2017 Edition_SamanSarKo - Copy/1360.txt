no ‘fl ashback’/re- sistance from cannula. Management: Stop and disconnect infusion. Aspirate any residual drug before cannula removed. Follow local policies (ask for the ‘extravasa- tion kit’). Follow any drug-specifi c recommendations. For DNA-binding drugs (an- thracyclines, alkylating agents, antitumour antibiotics), use a dry cold compress to vasoconstrict and  drug spread. For non-DNA-binding drugs (vinca alkaloids, taxa- nes, platin salts), use a dry warm compress to vasodilate and  drug distribution. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 552244 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 erac evitaillap dna ygolocnO Surgery 525 • Prevention: Risk-reducing surgery, eg thyroidectomy in MEN (p223), colectomy in FAP (p521). • Screening: Endoscopy, colposcopy. • Diagnosis and staging: Fine needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, vacuum- assisted biopsy, excisional/incisional biopsy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, endos- copy, diagnostic/staging laparoscopy, laparascopic ultrasound. • Treatment: Resection of solid tumour (may be combined with chemo/radio- therapy). • Reconstruction: Eg following treatment for breast, head and neck cancers. • Palliation: Bypass, stoma, stenting, pathological fractures.
