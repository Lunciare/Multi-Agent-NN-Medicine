pillow. Start by examining the dorsal surface and then turn the hands over. Always ask about pain or tender areas. Follow the ‘look, ask the patient to move, then feel’ to avoid causing pain. Skin On both the palm and the dorsum start by inspecting the skin for: 1 Colour—pigmentation of creases, jaundice, palmar erythema (fi g 2.44). 2 Consistency—tight (sclerodactyly), thick (DM, acromegaly) (fi g 2.39). 3 Characteristic lesions—pulp infarcts, rashes, purpura, spider naevi, telangiecta- sia, tophi (fi g 2.35), scars (eg carpal tunnel release). Fig 2.35 Gouty tophi. Nails Look for the same skin changes as the palm, plus tendon xan- thomata, plaques, and joint re- placement scars, and examine the nails for: • Pitting and onycholysis (p76). • Clubbing (p77). • Nail fold infarcts and splinter haemorrhages. • Other lesions, eg Beau’s lines Fig 2.36 Leuconychia. (fi g 2.41, p76), koilonychia, leuconychia (fi g 2.36). Muscles Examine the muscles for wasting and fascicu- lations; on the dorsal surface look for wasting, particularly of dorsal interossei. On the palm look particularly at the thenar and hypothenar eminences. • Thenar wasting (fi g 2.37) = median nerve lesion. • Generalized wasting, particularly of the interossei on the dorsum, but
