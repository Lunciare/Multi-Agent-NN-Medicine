of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) due to cholestasis and bilirubin in the gut lumen results in osteo- malacia and coagu lopathy; HCC (p286). Tests Blood: ALP, GT, and mildly AST & ALT; late disease: bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time. 98% are AMA M2 subtype +ve, eg in a titre of 1:40 (see earlier in topic). Other autoantibodies (p553) may occur in low titres. Immunoglobulins are  (esp. IgM). TSH & cholesterol  or . Ultrasound: Excludes extrahepatic cholestasis. Biopsy: Not usually needed (unless drug-induced cholestasis or hepatic sarcoidosis need excluding); look for granulomas around bile ducts ± cirrhosis.31 Treatment Symptomatic: Pruritus: try colestyramine 4–8g/24h PO; naltrexone and rifampicin may also help. Diarrhoea: codeine phosphate, eg 30mg/8h PO. Osteoporo- sis prevention: p682. Specifi c: Fat-soluble vitamin prophylaxis: vitamin A, D, and K. Consider high-dose ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)Ωit may improve survival and delay transplantation. SE: weight. Monitoring: Regular LFT; ultrasound ± AFP twice-yearly if cirrhotic. Liver transplantation: (See p277.) For end-stage disease or intractable pruritus. Histological recurrence in the graft: ~17% after 5yrs; although graft failure can occur as a result of recurrence, it is rare and unpredictable. Prognosis Highly variable. The Mayo survival model is a validated predictor of survival
