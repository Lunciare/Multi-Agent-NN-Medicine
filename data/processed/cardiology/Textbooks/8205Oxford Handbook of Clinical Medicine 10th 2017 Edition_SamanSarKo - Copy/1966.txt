Rarely, arrhythmia. Watch out for: • Retrograde fl ow back into the chest. • Persistent bubbling—there may be a continual leak from the lung. • Blockage of the tube from clots or kinking—no swinging or bubbling. • Malposition—check position with CXR. Relieving a tension pneumothorax Symptoms Acute respiratory distress, chest pain, respiratory arrest. Signs Hypotension; distended neck veins; asymmetrical lung expansion; trachea and apex deviated away from side of reduced air entry and hyperresonance to percussion. There is no time for a CXR (but see fi g 16.43, p749). Aim To release air from the pleural space. In a tension pneumothorax, air is drawn into the intrapleural space with each breath, but cannot escape due to a valve-like eff ect of the tiny fl ap in the parietal pleura. The increasing pressure progressively embarrasses the heart and the other lung. 100% oxygen. Prodedure • Insert a large-bore IV cannula (eg Venfl on®) usually through the 2nd intercostal space in the midclavicular line or the ‘safe triangle’ for chest drain insertion (see BOX ‘The “safe triangle” for insertion’). Remove the stylet, allowing the trapped air to es- cape, usually with an audible hiss. This converts the tension pneumothorax to an open
