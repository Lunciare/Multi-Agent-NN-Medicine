renal disease) and hydroxychloroquine for joint and skin symptoms. Azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate as steroid-spar- ing agents. Belimumab (monoclonal antibody) used as an add-on therapy for auto- antibody positive disease where disease activity is high.44 (See BOX.) • Mild fl ares: (No serious organ damage.) Hydroxychloroquine or low-dose steroids. • Moderate fl ares: (Organ involvement.) May require DMARDs or mycophenolate. Severe fl ares: If life- or organ-threatening, eg haemolytic anaemia, nephritis, severe pericarditis or CNS disease; urgent high-dose steroids, mycophenolate, rituxi- mab, cyclophosphamide. MDT working vital for neuropsychiatric lupus (psychometric testing, lumbar puncture may be indicated). Lupus nephritis: (p314.) May require more intensive immunosuppression with ster- oids and cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate. BP control vital (e.g. ACE-i). Renal re- placement therapy (p306) may be needed if disease progresses; nephritis recurs in ~50% post-transplant, but is a rare cause of graft failure.45 Prognosis: ~80% survival at 15 years.43 There is an increased long-term risk of CVD and osteoporosis. Antiphospholipid syndrome Can be associated with SLE (20–30%). Often occurs as a primary disease. Antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin & lupus antico- agulant, anti- 2 glycoprotein 1) cause CLOTS: Coagulation defect (arterial/venous), Livedo reticularis (p557), Obstetric (recurrent miscarriage), Thrombocytopenia. Thrombotic tendency aff ects cerebral, renal, and
