Handbook of Clinical medicine

there signs of Graves’ disease, eg bulging eyes (exophthalmos) or goitre—p218)? Is the face dysmorphic, eg Down’s syndrome, Marfan’s syndrome (p706)—or Turner’s, Noonan’s, or Williams syndromes (p149)? Praecordium Palpate the apex beat. Normal position: 5th intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. Is it displaced laterally? Is it abnormal in nature: heaving (caused by outfl ow obstruction, eg aortic stenosis or systemic hypertension), thrust- ing (caused by volume overload, eg mitral or aortic incompetence), tapping (mitral stenosis, essentially a palpable 1st heart sound), diffuse (LV failure, dilated cardio- myopathy) or double impulse (H(O)CM, p152)? Is there dextrocardia? Feel for left parasternal heave (RV enlargement, eg in pulmonary stenosis, cor pulmonale, ASD) or thrills (transmitted murmurs). Auscultating the heart Also auscultate for bruits over the carotids and elsewhere, particularly if there is inequality between pulses or absence of a pulse. Causes: ath- erosclerosis (elderly), vasculitis (young, p556). Lungs Examine the bases for creps & pleural eff usions, indicative of cardiac failure. Oedema Examine the ankles, legs, sacrum, and torso for pitting oedema. (You may prefer to examine ankles while standing at the foot of the bed as it is a good early clue that there may be further pathology to be found.)
