being. Death following cessation of cardiorespiratory function: Simultaneous and irreversible onset of apnoea, absence of circulation, and un- consciousness. Cardiorespiratory arrest is confi rmed by observation of the following: • Absence of central pulse on palpation. • Absence of heart sounds on auscultation. • After 5 minutes of cardiorespiratory arrest absence of brainstem activity is con- fi rmed by the absence of pupillary responses to light, an absent corneal refl ex, and no motor response to supra-orbital pressure. The time of death is the time at which these criteria are fulfi lled. Brainstem death: Brainstem pathology causing irreversible damage to its integrative functions including neural control of cardiorespiratory function and consciousness. Diagnosed by an absence of brainstem refl exes: • No pupil light response. • No corneal refl ex (blink to touch). • Absent oculovestibular refl exes (no eye movements seen with injection of ice- cold water into each external auditory meatus, tympanic membranes visualized). • No motor response to stimulation within the cranial nerve distribution (supra- orbital pressure). • No cough/gag refl ex. • No respiratory response to hypercarbia: oxgenation is maintained (SpO>85%) 2 but ventilation is reduced to achieve P aCO 2 ≥6.0kPa with pH ≤7.40. No respiratory
