indicates severe water loss. As treatment commences Na+ rises as water enters cells. Na+ is also low due to an artefact; corrected plasma [Na+] = Na+ + 2.4[(glucose Ω5.5)/5.5]. • Ketonuria does not equate with ketoacidosis. Anyone may have up to ++ketonuria after an overnight fast. Not all ketones are due to diabetes—consider alcohol if glucose normal. Always check venous blood ketones. • Recurrent ketoacidosis. Blood glucose may return to normal long before ketones are removed from the blood, and premature termination of insulin infusion may lead to lack of clearance and return to DKA. This may be avoided by maintaining a constant rate of insulin infusion (with co-infusion of glucose 10% to maintain plasma glucose at 6–10mmol/L) until blood ketones <0 . 6mmol/L and pH >7.3. • Acidosis but without gross elevation of glucose may occur, but consider overdose (eg aspirin) and lactic acidosis (in elderly diabetics). • Serum amylase is often raised (up to ≈10) and non-specifi c abdominal pain is com- mon, even in the absence of pancreatitis. Complications Cerebral oedema (get help if sudden CNS decline), aspiration pneu- monia, hypokalaemia, hypom agnesaemia, hypophosphataemia, thromboembolism. Prevention Talk to the patient: evaluate compliance and educate about triggers. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb
