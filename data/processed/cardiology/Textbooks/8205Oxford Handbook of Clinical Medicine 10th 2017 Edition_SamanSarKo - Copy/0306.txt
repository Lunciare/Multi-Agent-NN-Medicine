used in hypertension (eg indapamide) and heart failure (eg metolazone). SE: K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, urate (±gout), impotence (NB: small doses, eg chlortalidone 25mg/24h rarely cause signifi cant SEs) • Potassium-sparing diuretics: aldosterone antagonists (eg spironolactone, eplerenone) directly block aldosterone receptors; amiloride blocks the epithelial sodium channel in the distal convoluted tubules. Vasodilators Used in heart failure, IHD, and hypertension. Nitrates (p116) preferen- tially dilate veins and the large arteries,  fi lling pressure (pre-load), while hydrala- zine (often used with nitrates) primarily dilates the resistance vessels, thus  BP (after-load). Prazosin (an -blocker) dilates arteries and veins. Calcium antagonists These  cell entry of Ca2+ via voltage-sensitive channels in smooth muscle, thereby promoting coronary and peripheral vasodilat ion and reduc- ing myocardial oxygen consumption. All current drugs block L-type Ca2+ channels. However, their eff ects diff er because of diff erential binding properties. • The dihydropyridines, eg nifed ipine, amlodipine, are mainly peripheral vasodilators (also dilate coronary arteries) and cause a refl ex tachycardia, so are often used with a -blocker. They are used mainly in hypertension and angina. • The non-dihydropyridines—verapamil and diltiazem—also slow conduction at the AV and SA nodes and may be used to treat hypertension, angina,
