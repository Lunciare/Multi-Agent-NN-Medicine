bundle branch block, right vent- ricular strain (inverted T in V1 to V4). The classical SI QIII TIII pattern (p98) is rare. Further investigations are shown on p818. Treatment See p818. If haemodynamically unstable, thrombolyse for massive PE (alteplase 10mg IV over 1min, then 90mg IVI over 2h; max 1 . 5mg/kg if <65kg). Haemodynamically stable: start LMWH or unfractionated heparin if underlying renal impairment and treat for 5 days. Then, start DOAC (direct oral anticoagulant) or war- farin (p350). For warfarin, stop heparin when INR is 2–3, due to intial prothrombotic eff ect of warfarin (target INR of 2–3). Consider placement of a vena caval fi lter if contra-indication to anticoagulation. Unprovoked PE In patients with no known provoking risk factors, consider inves- tigation for possible underlying malignany. Undertake full history, examination (including breast), CXR, FBC, calcium, LFTS, urinalysis. Patients >40yrs consider abdo- pelvic CT and mammography in women. Consider antiphospholipid and thrombo- philia testing if family history positive (p374). Prevention Give heparin to all immobile patients. Stop HRT and the combined con- traceptive pill pre-op (if reliable with another form of contraception). Pneumothorax Caus es Often spontaneous (especially in young, thin men) due to rupture of a sub-
