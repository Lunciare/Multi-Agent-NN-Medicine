+ 2 minor. Evidence of group A -haemolytic streptococcal infection: • Positive throat culture (usually negative by the time RF symptoms appear). • Rapid streptococcal antigen test +ve. • Elevated or rising streptococcal antibody titre (eg anti-streptolysin O (ASO) or DNase B titre). • Recent scarlet fever. Major criteria: • Carditis: tachycardia, murmurs (mitral or aortic regurgitation, Carey Coombs’ murmur, p46), pericardial rub, CCF, cardiomegaly, conduction defects (45–70%). An apical systolic murmur may be the only sign.52 • Arthritis: a migratory, ‘fl itting’ polyarthritis; usually aff ects larger joints (75%). • Subcutaneous nodules: small, mobile, painless nodules on extensor surfaces of joints and spine (2–20%). • Erythema marginatum: (fi g 3.42) geographical-type rash with red, raised edges and clear centre; occurs mainly on trunk, thighs and arms in 2–10% (p562). • Sydenham’s chorea (St Vitus’ dance): occurs late in 10%. Unilateral or bilateral involuntary semi-purposeful movements. May be preceded by emotional lability and uncharacteristic behaviour. Minor criteria: • Fever. • Raised ESR or CRP. • Arthralgia (but not if arthritis is one of the major criteria). • Prolonged PR interval (but not if carditis is major criterion). • Previous rheumatic fever. Management • Bed rest until CRP normal for 2wks
