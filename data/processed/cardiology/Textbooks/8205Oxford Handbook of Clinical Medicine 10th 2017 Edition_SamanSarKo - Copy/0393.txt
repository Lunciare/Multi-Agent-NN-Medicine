with mitral or aortic valve disease. Also: congenital, infective endocarditis. Symptoms: Fatigue, ascites, oedema. Signs: Giant a wave and slow y descent in JVP (p43); opening snap, early diastolic murmur heard at the left sternal edge in inspiration. AF can also occur. Diagnosis: Echo. Treatment: Diuretics; surgical repair. Pulmonary stenosis Causes: Usually congenital (Turner syndrome, Noonan syn- drome, Williams syndrome, Fallot’s tetralogy, rubella). Acquired causes: rheumatic fever, carcinoid syndrome. Symptoms: Dyspnoea; fatigue; oedema; ascites. Signs: Dys- morphic facies (congenital causes); prominent a wave in JVP; RV heave. In mild stenosis, there is an ejection click, ejection systolic murmur (which radiates to the left shoulder); widely split S2. In severe stenosis, the murmur becomes longer and obscures A2. P2 becomes softer and may be inaudible. Tests: ECG: RAD, P-pulmonale, RVH, RBBB; echo/TOE (p110); CXR: prominent pulmonary arteries caused by post-stenotic dilatation. Cardiac catheterization is diagnostic. Treatment: Pulmonary valvuloplasty or valvotomy. Pulmonary regurgitation Causes: Any cause of pulmonary hypertension (p194). Signs: Decrescendo murmur in early diastole at the left sternal edge (the Graham Steell murmur if associated with mitral stenosis and pulmonary hypertension). Cardiac surgery Cardiac surgery has come on a long way since 1923 when Dr Henry Souttar58,59 used his fi
