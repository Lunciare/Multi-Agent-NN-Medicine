hyponatraemia may itself cause mania, be cautious of saying ‘It’s water intoxication from psychogenic polydipsia’. Diagnosis Water deprivation test: See BOX ‘The 8-hour water deprivation test’. NB: it is often diffi cult to diff erentiate primary polydipsia from partial DI. : DM; diuret- ics or lithium use; primary polydipsia causes symptoms of polydipsia and polyuria with dilute urine. Its cause is poorly understood;19 it may be associated with schizo- phrenia or mania (±Li+ therapy), or, rarely, hypothal amic dis ease (neurosarcoid; tu- mour; encephalitis; brain injury; HIV encephalopathy). As part of this syndrome, the kidneys may lose their ability to fully concentrate urine, due to a wash-out of the normal concentrating gradient in the renal medulla. Treatment Cranial DI: MRI (head); test anterior pituitary function (p232). Give desm- opressin, a synthetic analogue of ADH (eg Desmomelt® tablets). Nephrogenic: Treat the cause. If it persists, try bendro fl umethiazide 5mg PO/24h. NSAIDS lower urine volume and plasma Na+ by inhibiting prostaglandin synthase: prostaglandins locally inhibit the action of ADH. Emergency management • Do urgent plasma U&E, and serum and urine osmolalities. Monitor urine output carefully and check U&E twice a day initially. • IVI to keep up with urine output. If
