In acute haemorrhage, use crossmatched blood if possible, but if not, use ‘universal donor’ group O RhΩve blood, changing to crossmatched blood as soon as possible. Transfusing patients with heart failure If Hb 50g/L with heart failure, trans- fusion with packed red cells is vital to restore Hb to a safe level, eg 60–80g/L, but must be done with care. Give each unit over 4h with furosemide (eg 40mg slow IV/PO; don’t mix with blood) with alternate units. Check for JVP and basal lung crackles; consider CVP line. Autologous transfusion There is a role for patients having their own blood stored pre-op for later use. Erythropoietin (EPO, p304) can increase the yield of au- tologous blood in normal people. Intraoperative cell salvage with retransfusion is also being used more often, especially in cardiac, vascular, and emergency surgery, Cost-analysis shows that it may be worthwhile on an economic basis alone. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 334488 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH Transfusion reactions 349 All UK blood products are now leucocyte-depleted (white cells <5≈106/L) so as to reduce the incidence of complications such as
