GI infl ammation with high sensitivity. Colonoscopy + bi- opsy: Even if mucosa looks normal. Small bowel: To detect isolated proximal disease by eg capsule endoscopy (p248, use dummy patency capsule 1st that disintegrates if it gets stuck); MRI increasingly used to assess pelvic disease and fi stulae, small bowel disease activity and strictures; US in skilled hands can provide small bowel imaging. Treatment (See BOX.8) Find out how your patient deals with what may be a brutal disease (no intimacy...no sex...no hope...‘I live with this alone and will die alone’). With a collaborative approach, courage, attention to detail, and a dose of humour, this can change. Help quit smoking. Optimize nutrition. Assess severity: T°, pulse, ESR, WCC, CRP, + albumin may merit admission for IV steroids. Mild–moderate: Symptomatic but systemically well. Prednisolone 40mg/d PO for 1wk, then taper by 5mg every wk for next 7wks. An alternative dietary approach based upon ‘elemental’ or ‘polymeric’ diets is eff ective in children but less used for adults. Plan maintenance therapy (see BOX). Severe: Admit for IV hydration/electrolyte replacement; IV steroids, eg hydrocorti- sone 100mg/6h or methylprednisolone 40mg/12h; thromboembolism prophylaxis (p350); ensure multiple stool MC&S/CDT to exclude infection. • Monitor T°, pulse,
