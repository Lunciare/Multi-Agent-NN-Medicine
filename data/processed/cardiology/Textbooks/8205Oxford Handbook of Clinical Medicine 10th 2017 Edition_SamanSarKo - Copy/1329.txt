at the pre-synaptic terminal, depolarization opens voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCCS). In Lambert–Eaton syndrome, anti- P/Q type VGCC antibodies disrupt this stage of synaptic transmission.15 3 Infl ux of Ca2+ through the VGCCs triggers fusion of synaptic vesicles with the pre-synaptic membrane (a process that botulinum toxin interferes with), and neurotransmitter is released from the vesicles into the synaptic cleft. 4 Transmitter molecules cross the synaptic cleft by diff usion and bind to re- ceptors on the post-synaptic membrane, causing depolarization of the post- synaptic membrane (the end-plate potential). This change in the post-synaptic membrane triggers muscle contraction at the NMJ, or onward transmission of the action potential in neurons. In myasthenia gravis, antibodies block the post-synaptic ACh receptors, preventing the end-plate potential from becom- ing large enough to trigger muscle contraction—and muscle weakness ensues. 5 Transmitter action is terminated by enzyme-induced degradation of transmit- ter (eg acetylcholinesterase), uptake into the pre-synaptic terminal or glial cells, or by diff usion away from synapse. Anticholinesterase treatments for myasthenia gravis, such as pyridostigmine, reduce the rate of degradation of ACh, increasing the chance that it will trigger an end-plate potential.
