used to replace protein. 20% albumin can be used temporarily in the hypoproteina emic patient (eg liver disease; nephrosis) who is fl uid overloaded, without giving an excessive salt load. Also used as replacement in abdominal paracentesis (p765). Others Cryoprecipitate (a source of fi brinogen); coagu lation concentrates (self-injected in haemophilia); immunoglobulins. Complications of transfusion Management of acute reactions:2 see BOX ‘Trans- fusion reactions’ and table 8.4. • Early (within 24h): Acute haemolytic reactions (eg ABO or Rh incompatibility); anaphylaxis; bacterial contamination; febrile reactions (eg from HLA antibodies); allergic reactions (itch, urticaria, mild fever); fl uid overload; transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI, ie ARDS due to antileucocyte antibodies in donor plasma). • Delayed (after 24h): Infections (eg viruses: hepatitis B/C, HIV; bacteria; protozoa; prions); iron overload (treatment, p342); GVHD; post-transfusion purpura—poten- tially lethal fall in platelet count 5–7d post-transfusion requiring specialist treat- ment with IV immunoglobulin and platelet transfusions. Massive blood transfusion This is defi ned as replacement of an individual’s en- tire blood volume (>10U) within 24h. Complications: platelets; Ca2+; clotting fac- tors; K+; hypothermia. Seek early and ongoing support from haematologist and blood bank who should advise on products and monitoring.
