Think: ‘In this ill patient when can I be sure that a low glucose is not contr ibuting to their illness?’ If <4mmol/L, you may be wise to treat (p834)—just in case. Consider, is the pa- tient on hypoglycaemics, have they binged on alcohol 24hrs pre test? Skipped meals? Is there an underlying illness, eg insulinoma? Unlikely, but possible. Keep an open mind; let the GP know. Counsel patient and relative about warning signs of hypoglycaemia. Be more inclined to investigate if the eff ects of even mild hypo- glycaemia might be disastrous (eg in pilots) or if there are unexplained symptoms. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 221144 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE Insulinoma 215 This often benign (90–95%) pancreatic islet cell tumour is sporadic or seen with MEN-1 (p223). It presents as fasting hypoglycaemia, with Whipple’s triad: 1 Symp toms associated with fasting or exercise. 2 Recorded hypoglycaemia with symptoms. 3 Symptoms relieved with glucose. Screening test Hypoglycaemia + plasma insulin during a long fast. Suppressive tests Give IV insulin and measure C-peptide. Normally exogenous insu- lin suppresses C-peptide production, but this does not occur in insulinoma. Imaging CT/MRI ± endoscopic pancreatic US ±
