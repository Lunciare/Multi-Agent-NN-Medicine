and visi ble corneal nerves. The gene involved in MEN-2a and b is the ret proto-oncogene, a receptor tyrosine kinase. Tests for ret mutations are revolu tion izing MEN-2 treatment by enabling a prophylactic thyroidectomy to be done before neoplasia occurs, usually before 3yrs of age. NB: ret mutations rarely contribute to sporadic parathyroid tumours. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes Autoimmune disorders cluster into two defi ned syndromes: Type 1 Autosomal recessive, rare. Cause: Mutations of AIRE (Auto ImmuneREgulator) gene on chromosome 21. Features: •Addison’s disease. •Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. •Hypo- parathyroidism. Also associated with hypogonadism, pernicious anaemia, autoim- mune primary hypothyroidism, chronic active hepatitis, vitiligo, alopecia. Type 2 HLA D3 and D4 linked, common. Cause: Polygenic. Features: •Addison’s disease. •Type 1 diabetes mellitus (in 20%). • Autoimmune thyroid disease—hypothyroidism or Graves’ disease. Also associated with primary hypogonadism, vitiligo, alopecia, pernicious anae- mia, chronic atrophic gastritis, coeliac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis.
