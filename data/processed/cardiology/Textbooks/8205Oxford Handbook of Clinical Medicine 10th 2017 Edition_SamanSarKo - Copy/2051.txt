needed If no success or becomes unstable: For refractory cases seek Sedation expert help and consider: • Procainamide • Overdrive pacing Synchronized DC shock: 150–200J 150–360J x 2 (biphasic*) *Check your defi brillator: energies given are for a typical biphasic defi brillator (preferred); if a monophasic shock used, higher energies will be required. Fig 19.9 Management of broad complex tachycardia. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 880055 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 806 Narrow complex tachycardia ECG shows rate of >100bpm and QRS complex duration of <120ms (<3 small squares on ECGs done at the standard UK rate of 25mm/s). Diff erential diagnosis (See p126.) • Sinus tachycardia: Normal P wave followed by normal QRS—not an arrhythmia! Do not attempt to cardiovert; if necessary (ie not a physiological response to fever/ hypovolaemia) rate control with -blockers. • Atrial tachyarrhythmias: Rhythm arises in atria, AV node is a bystander. • Atrial fi brillation (AF): absent P wave, irregular QRS complexes. • Atrial fl utter: atrial rate ~260–340bpm. Sawtooth baseline, due to a re-entrant circuit usually in the right atrium. Ventricular rate often 150bpm (2:1 block). • Atrial tachycardia: abnormally shaped P waves, may outnumber QRS. • Multifocal atrial tachycardia: ≥3 P-wave morphologies, irregular QRS complexes. • Junctional tachycardia:
