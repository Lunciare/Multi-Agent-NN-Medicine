blood cells: • >2 red cells/mm3 is abnormal. • Can come from anywhere in the urinary tract. Isomorphic red cells are similar to circulating red cells and may suggest bleeding from a genitourinary or external source. Dysmorphic red cells are abnormal in size/shape. Although they may in- dicate bleeding from the glomerulus (especially in exam questions!), assessment is subjective and dysmorphism also occurs due to changes in pH, osmolality, protein, and due to tubular passage. White blood cells: (fi g 7.2a) • >10 white cells/mm3 in an unspun specimen is abnormal. • Causes include UTI, glomerulonephritis, tubulointerstitial nephritis, renal trans- plant rejection, and malignancy. Squamous epithelial cells: • Often seen, not pathological. Casts: Casts are cylindrical bodies formed in the lumen of distal tubules. They are formed of Tamm-Horsfall protein combined with cells. • Hyaline cast (fi g 7.2b)—seen in normal urine. • Red cell cast (fi g 7.2c)—signify an infl ammatory process in the glomerulus, eg glomerulonephritis (p311). • White cell cast (fi g 7.2d)—pyelonephritis, interstitial nephritis (p318), glomeru- lonephritis (p311). • Granular cast (fi g 7.2e)—formed from degenerated tubular cells, seen in any chronic kidney disease. Crystals: Crystals are common in old or cold urine and may not
