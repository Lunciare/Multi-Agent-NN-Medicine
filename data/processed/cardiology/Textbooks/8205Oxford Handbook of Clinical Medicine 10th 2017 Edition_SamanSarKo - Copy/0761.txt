UTI is the primary diff erential. Consider prostatic aetiology if there is diffi culty initiating voiding, poor stream and dribbling.

Poly uria is the voiding of abnormally high volumes of urine, usually from high fl uid intake. Consider also DM, diabetes insipidus (p240), hypercalcaemia (p676), renal medullary disorders (causing impaired concentra- tion of urine). • Loin pain: Ureteric colic is severe and radiates anteriorly and to the groin. It is caused by a renal stone, clot, or a sloughed papilla. For pain confi ned to the loin consider pyelonephritis, renal cyst pathology, and renal infarct. • Visible haematuria: (VH, macroscopic.)
