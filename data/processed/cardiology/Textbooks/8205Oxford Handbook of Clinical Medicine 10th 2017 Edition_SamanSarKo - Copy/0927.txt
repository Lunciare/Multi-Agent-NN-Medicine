Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, myelodysplasia) These are a heterogeneous group of disorders that manifest as marrow failure with risk of life-threatening infection and bleeding (median survival varies from 6 months to 6 years according to disease type). Mostly primary, but can develop secondary to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 30% transform to acute leukaemia. Tests: Pancytopenia (p364), with reticulocyte count. Marrow cellularity is usu- ally increased due to ineff ective haematopoiesis. Ring sideroblasts may also be seen in
