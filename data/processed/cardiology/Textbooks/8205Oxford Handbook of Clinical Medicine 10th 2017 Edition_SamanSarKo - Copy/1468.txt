malignancy (p552). Diabetes mellitus Ulcers, necrobiosis lipoidica (shiny yellowish area on shin ± tel- angiectasia; fi g 12.27), granuloma annulare (OHCS p586), acanthosis nigricans (pig- mented, rough thickening of axillary, neck, or groin skin with warty lesions; fi g 12.28). Coeliac disease Dermatitis herpetiformis: Itchy blisters, in groups on knees, el- bows, and scalp. The itch (which can drive patients to suicide) responds to dapsone 25–200mg/24h PO within 48h—and this may be used as a diagnostic test. The mainte- nance dose may be as little as 50mg/wk. A gluten-free diet should be adhered to, but in 30% dapsone will need to be continued. SE (dose-related): haemolysis (CI: anaemia, G6PD-defi ciency), hepatitis, agranulocytosis (monitor FBC and LFTS). There is an  risk of small bowel lymphoma with coeliac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis—so surveillance is needed. Hyperthyroidism Pretibial myxoedema: Red oedematous swellings above lateral malleoli, progressing to thickened oedema of legs and feet, thyroid acropachy— clubbing + subperiosteal new bone in phalanges. Other endocrinopathies: p203. Liver disease Palmar erythema; spider naevi; gynaecomastia; decrease in pubic hair; jaundice; bruising; scratch marks. Malabsorption Dry pigmented skin, easy bruising, hair loss, leuconychia. Neoplasia Acanthosis nigricans: (See ‘Diabetes mellitus’ and fi g 12.28.) Associ- ated with
