PBC (p282), PSC (p282) and chronic viral hepatitis. Table 6.12 Classifying autoimmune hepatitis: types I–II I Seen in 80%. Typical patient:  <40yrs. Antismooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) +ve in 80% . Antinuclear antibody (ANA) +ve in 10%. IgG in 97%. Good response to immunosuppression in 80%. 25% have cirrhosis at presentation. II Commoner in Europe than USA. More often seen in children, and more commonly progresses to cirrhosis and less treatable. Typically anti-liver/kidney microsomal type 1 (LKM1) antibodies +ve. ASMA and ANA Ωve. Management Immunosuppressant therapy: Prednisolone 30mg/d PO for 1 month;  by 5mg a month to a maintenance dose of 5–10mg/d PO. Corticoster- oids can sometimes be stopped after 2yrs but relapse occurs in 50–86%. Aza- thioprine (50–100mg/d PO) may be used as a steroid-sparing agent to maintain remission. Remission is achievable in 80% of patients within 3yrs. 10- and 20yr survival rates are >80%. SES are a big problem (p376)—partly ameliorated by a switch to budesonide, eg in non-cirrhotic AIH. Liver transplantation: (See p277.) Indicated for decompensated cirrhosis or if there is failure to respond to medical therapy, but recurrence may occur. It is ef- fective (actuarial 10yr survival is 75%). Prognosis Appears not to matter whether
