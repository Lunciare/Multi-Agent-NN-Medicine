Air In CT colonography, air (or CO 2) is insuffl ated as a negative contrast medium after barium administration to enhance mucosal defi nition. Water can also be used PO and PR to outline the lumen of the gut. Gadolinium A lanthanide series element with paramagnetic qualities that is ad- ministered intravenously (as gadolinium-DTPA) to enhance the contrast of certain structures in MRI. It works by reducing the time to relaxation (TR) of hydrogen nuclei in its proximity and appears as high signal on T1-weighted scans. It does not cross the blood–brain barrier so is useful in enhancing isointense extra-axial tumours such as meningiomas. It can also highlight areas where the blood–brain barrier has broken down secondary to infl ammatory or neoplastic processes. It is renally excreted: check eGFR: if signifi cantly reduced, gadolinium is contrain- dicated, as up to 30% may develop progressive nephrogenic systemic fi brosis/ nephrogenic fi brosing dermopathy which causes generalized fi brosis which im- pairs movement and breathing—and which may be fatal.
