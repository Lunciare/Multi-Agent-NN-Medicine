Cholesterol and triglyceride; macrocytosis (less often normochromic anaemia too). Causes of primary autoimmune hypothyroidism • Primary atrophic hypothyroidism: :≈6:1. Common. Diff use lymphocytic infi lt- ration of the thyroid, leading to atrophy, hence no goitre. • Hashimoto’s thyroiditis: Goitre due to lympho cytic and plasma cell infi ltration. Commoner in women aged 60–70yrs. May be hypothyroid or euthyroid; rarely initial period of hypert hyroid (‘Hashitoxicosis’). Autoantibody titres are very high. Other causes of primary hypothyrodism World-wide the chief cause is iodine defi ciency. • Post-thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment. • Drug-induced: Antithyroid drugs, amiodarone, lithium, iodine. • Subacute thyroiditis: Temporary hypothyroidism after hyperthyroid phase.
