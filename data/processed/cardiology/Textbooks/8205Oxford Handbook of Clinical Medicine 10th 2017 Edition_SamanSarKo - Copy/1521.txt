follows total or subtotal c olectomy, eg for UC; subsequent formation of ileal pouch-anal anasto- mosis (pouch of ileum is joined to the upper anal canal) can allow for stoma reversal. Alternative (non-stoma forming) surgery Low/ultralow anterior resection: All or part of the rectum is excised and the proximal colon anastomosed to the top of the anal canal (the lower the level of anastomosis, the higher the risk of complication). Transanal endoscopic microsurgery: Allows excision of small tumours within the rectum with preservation of sphincter function. Urostomies are fashioned after total cystectomy, bringing urine from the ureters to the abdominal wall via an ileal conduit that is usually incontinent. Formation of a catheterizable valvular mechanism may retain continence. Advances in urological surgery have seen an increase in continence-saving procedures such as orthotopic neobladder reconstruction, with good long-term continence rates. When choosing a stoma site, avoid: • Bony prominences (eg anterior superior iliac spine, costal margins). • The umbilicus. • Old wounds/scars—there may be adhesions beneath. • Skin folds and creases. • The waistline. • The site should be assessed pre-operatively by the stoma nurse, with the patient both lying and standing. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 558822 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Complications of stomas 583
