Pneumothorax Caus es Often spontaneous (especially in young, thin men) due to rupture of a sub- pleural bulla. Other causes: asthma; COPD; TB; pneumonia; lung abscess; carcinoma; cystic fi brosis; lung fi brosis; sarcoidosis; connective tissue disorders (Marfan’s syn., Ehlers–Danlos syn.), trauma; iatrogenic (subclavian CVP line insertion, pleural aspira- tion/biopsy, transbronchial biopsy, liver biopsy, +ve pressure ventilation). Clinical features Symptoms: May be asymptomatic (fi t, young, and small pneumo- thorax) or there may be sudden onset of dyspnoea and/or pleuritic chest pain. Pa- tients with asthma or COPD may present with a sudden deterioration. Mechanically ventilated patients may present with hypoxia or an increase in ventilation pressures. Signs: Reduced expansion, hyper-resonance to percussion, and diminished breath sounds on the aff ected side. With a tension pneumothorax, the trachea will be devi- ated away from the aff ected side, p749, p815. Management: See p815. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 119900 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem tsehC Investigating suspected PE 191 Diagnosis of PE is improved by adopting a stepwise approach, combining an objec- tive probability score, with subsequent investigations, as follows.
