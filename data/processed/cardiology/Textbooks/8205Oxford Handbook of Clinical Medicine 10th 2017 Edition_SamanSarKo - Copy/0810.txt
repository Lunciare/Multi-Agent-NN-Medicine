(eg membra- nous glomerulonephritis), or the associated systemic condition (eg lupus nephritis). Nephrotic or nephritic? The glomerulonephritides classically present on a spectrum ranging from nephro- sis (proteinuria due to podocyte pathology, p312), to nephritis (haematuria due to infl ammatory damage, p311). This is illustrated in fi g 7.10. However, if a GN causes scarring, then proteinuria can occur. Proteinuria can therefore complicate the longer-term clinical picture of any GN, including those that are classically ‘nephritic’.

Blood: FBC, U&E, LFT, CRP; immu- noglobulins, electrophoresis, complement (C3, C4); autoantibodies (p553): ANA, ANCA, anti-dsDNA, anti-GBM; blood culture, ASOT, hepatitis serology. Urine: MC&S, Bence Jones protein, A:CR/P:CR (p294), RBC casts (p295). Imaging: CXR (pulmonary haemorrhage), renal ultrasound (size and anatomy for biopsy). Renal biopsy: Required for diagnosis.
