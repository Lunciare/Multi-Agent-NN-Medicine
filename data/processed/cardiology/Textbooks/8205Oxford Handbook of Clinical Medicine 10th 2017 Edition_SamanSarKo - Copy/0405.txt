Associa- tions: alcohol, BP, chemotherapeutics, haemochromatosis, viral infection, autoim- mune, peri- or postpartum, thyrotoxicosis, congenital (X-linked). Prevalence: 0.2%. Presentation: Fatigue, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema, RVF, emboli, AF, VT. Signs: Pulse, BP, JVP, displaced and diff use apex, S3 gallop, mitral or tricuspid regurgita- tion (MR/TR), pleural eff usion, oedema, jaundice, hepatomegaly, ascites. Tests: Blood: BNP (p137), Na+ indicates a poor prognosis. CXR: cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema. ECG: tachycardia, non-specifi c T-wave changes, poor R-wave progression. Echo: glob- ally dilated hypokinetic heart and low ejection fraction. Look for MR, TR, LV mural thrombus. : Bed rest, diuretics, -blockers, ACE-i, anticoagu l ation, biventricular pac- ing, ICDs, LVADs, transplantation. Mortality: Variable, eg 40% in 2yrs. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) LV outfl ow tract (LVOT) obstruction from asymmetric septal hypertrophy. HCM is the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in the young. Prevalence: 0.2%. Autosomal dominant inheritance, but 50% are spo- radic. 70% have mutations in genes encoding -myosin, -tropomyosin, and troponin T. May present at any age. Ask about family history of sudden death. Symptoms and signs: Sudden death may be the fi rst manifestation of HCM in many patients (VF is amenable to implantable defi brillators), angina, dyspnoea, palpitation, syncope, CCF. Jerky pulse; a
