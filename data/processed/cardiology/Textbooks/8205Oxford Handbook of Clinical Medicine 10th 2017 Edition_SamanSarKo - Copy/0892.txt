tetramers (=HbH) due to excess  chains, HbBarts, HbA, and HbA2. If two genes are deleted (--/ or -/-), there is an asymptomatic carrier state, with MCV. With one gene deleted, the clinical state is normal. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 334422 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH Structure of haemoglobin 343 Table 8.2 The three main types of Hb in adult blood Type Peptide chains % in adult blood % in fetal blood HbA 2 2 97 10–50 HbA2 2 2 2.5 Trace HbF 2 2 0.5 50–90 Adult haemoglobin (HbA ) is a tetramer of 2 - and 2 -globin chains each con- taining a haem group. In the fi rst year of life, adult haemoglobin replaces fetal haemoglobin (HbF). It might be thought that because the molecular details of the thalassaemias are so well worked out they represent a perfect example of the reductionist principle at work: fi nd out exactly what is happening within molecules, and you will be able to explain all the manifestations of a disease. But this is not so. We have to recog- nize that two people with the identical mutation at their  loci may have quite dif- ferent diseases. Co-inheritance of other genes and conditions (eg 
