in risk of hip fracture. Table 14.5 Interpreting DEXA bone scan results T-score >0 BMD is better than the reference. 0 to Ω1 BMD is in the top 84%: no evidence of osteoporosis. Ω1 to Ω2.5 Osteopenia. Risk of later osteoporotic fracture. Off er lifestyle advice. Ω2.5 or worse Osteoporosis. Off er lifestyle advice and treatment (p682). Repeat DEXA in 2yrs. Some indications for DEXA: • NICE suggests DEXA if previous low-trauma fracture, or for women ≥ 65yrs with one or more risk factors for osteoporosis, or younger if two or more. The benefi ts of universal screening for osteoporosis remain unproven, but some authorities rec- ommend this for men and women over 70—and earlier if risk factors are present.17 • DEXA is not needed pre-treatment for women over 75yrs if previous low-trauma fracture, or ≥ 2 present of rheumatoid arthritis, alcohol excess, or positive family history. • Prior to giving long-term predniso lone (eg 3 months at >5mg/d). Steroids cause osteoporosis by promoting osteoclast bone resorption, muscle mass, and Ca2+ absorption from the gut. • Men or women with osteopenia if low-trauma, non-vertebral fracture. • Bone and bone-remodelling disorders (eg parathyroid disorders, myeloma, HIV, esp. if on protease inhibitors).
