They guide the decisions we make in our clinics and ward rounds, what we tell our patients, and what we omit to tell them.’ Tony Lopez, Journal of Royal Society of Medicine 2001;94:603–4. In the silences of our consultations it is we who are under the microscope, and we cannot escape our destiny in the sphere of ethics. To give us courage in this enterprise, we can recall the law of the aviator and seagull: it is only by facing the prevailing wind that we can become airborne, and achieve a new vantage point from which to survey our world. We hope for moral perception: to be able to visualize the morally salient features of a situation. For without this, ethical issues may fl oat past never to be resolved. Be alert to words which may carry hidden assumptions: ‘futil- ity’, ‘consent’, ‘best interests’.16 Consider WIGWAM in your routine patient review: • Wishes of the patient: are they known or unknown? • Issues of confi dentiality/disclosure. •
