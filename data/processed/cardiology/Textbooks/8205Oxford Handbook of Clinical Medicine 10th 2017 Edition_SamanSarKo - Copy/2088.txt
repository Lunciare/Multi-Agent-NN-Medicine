treat ICP (p830). If frontal sinuses or teeth are the source, the likely organism will be Strep. milleri (microaerophilic), or oropharyngeal anaerobes. In ear abscesses, B. fragilis or other anaerobes are most common. Bacterial abscesses are often peripheral; toxoplasma lesions (p425) are deeper (eg basal ganglia). NB: ask yourself: is the patient immunocompromised? Discuss with infectious diseases/microbiology. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 882244 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 825 __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 882255 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 826 Status epilepticus This means seizures lasting for >30min, or repeated seizures without intervening consciousness. Mortality and the risk of permanent brain damage increase with the length of attack. Aim to terminate seizures lasting more than a few minutes as soon as possible (<20min). Status usually occurs in patients with known epilepsy. If it is the 1st presentation, the chance of a structural brain lesion is high (>50%). Diagnosis of tonic–clonic status is usually clear. Non-convulsive status (eg absence status or continuous partial sei- zures with preservation of consciousness) may be more diffi cult: look for subtle eye or lid movement. For other signs, see pp484, 490–3. An EEG can be very helpful. Could the patient be pregnant (any pelvic mass)? If so, eclampsia (OHCS p48) is the likely diagnosis, check the
