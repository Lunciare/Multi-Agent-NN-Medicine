infusion by 1 unit/h until target rates achieved Check capillary blood glucose and ketones hourly Check VBG (pH, HCO3Ω, K+) at 2h, 4h, 8h, 12h, and 24h (or more frequent) Continue fl uids and assess need for K+ (see below) Consider catheter if not passed urine by 1h, aim for urine output 0.5mL/kg/h. Consider NG tube if vomiting or drowsy Start all patients on LMWH Avoid hypoglycaemia! When glucose <14mmol/L start 10% glucose at 125mL/h to run alongside saline and prevent hypoglycaemia Continue fi xed-rate insulin until ketones <0 . 6mmol/L, venous pH >7.3, and venous bicarb >15mmol/L. Do not rely on urinary ketones to indicate resolution—they stay positive after DKA resolved Find and treat infection/cause for DKA Fig 19.23 Management plan for diabetic ketoacidosis.  Fluid replacement • 0.9% saline is the replacement fl uid of choice. • Typical fl uid defi cit is 100mL/kg, so for an average 70kg man = 7 litres. • Give eg 1L in 1h (faster if systolic BP <90mmHg) then: 1L over 2h, 1L over 2h, 1L over 4h, 1L over 4 h, 1L over 8h. This regimen may not be appropriate for all: reas- sess frequently, especially if young, elderly, pregnant, or
