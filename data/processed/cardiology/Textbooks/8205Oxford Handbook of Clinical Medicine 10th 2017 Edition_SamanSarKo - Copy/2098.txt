serum osmolality, clotting, blood culture. • Consider toxicology screen. • CXR—any source of infection that might indicate abscess? • CT head. • Then consider LP if safe. Measure the opening pressure! Management See fi g 19.22. The goal is to ICP and avert secondary injury. Urgent neurosurgery is required for the defi nitive treatment of ICP from focal causes (eg haematomas). This is achieved via a craniotomy or burr hole. Also, an ICP monitor (or bolt) may be placed to monitor pressure. Holding measures are listed in fi g 19.22. Herniation syndromes Uncal herniation is caused by a lateral supratentorial mass, which pushes the ipsi- lateral inferomedial temporal lobe (uncus) through the temporal incisura and against the midbrain. The IIIrd nerve, travelling in this space, gets compressed, causing a dilated ipsilateral pupil, then ophthalmoplegia (a fi xed pupil localizes a lesion poorly but is ‘ipsilateralizing’). This may be followed (quickly) by contralateral hemiparesis (pressure on the cerebral peduncle) and coma from pressure on the ascending re- ticular activating system (ARAS) in the midbrain. Cerebellar tonsil herniation is caused by pressure in the posterior fossa forcing the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. Ataxia, VIth nerve palsies, and upgoing plantar refl
