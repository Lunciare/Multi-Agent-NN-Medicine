preventable deaths are in areas without universal screening. 45 Defi ning hypertension BP has a skewed normal distribution (p751) within the popu- lation, and risk is continuously related to BP, so it is impo ssible to defi ne ‘hyperten- sion’. 46 We choose to select a value above which risk is signifi cantly increased and the benefi t of treatment is clear cut, see below. Don’t rely on a single reading—assess over a period of time (how long depends on the BP and the presence of other risk factors or end-organ damage). Confi rm with 24hr ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM); or a week of home readings. NB: the diagnostic threshold is lower ~135/85mmHg. Whom to treat All with BP ≥160/100mmHg (or ABPM ≥150/95mmHg). For those ≥140/90, the decision depends on the risk of coronary events, presence of diabetes, or end-organ damage; see fi g 3.40. 44 The HYVET study showed that there is even sub- stantial benefi t in treating the over-80s. 47 Lower thresholds may be appropriate for young people—BP is on average lower in young people (eg 100–110/60–70 in 18-year- olds) and they have a ‘lifetime’ of risk ahead of them; but evidence to treat is lacking.
