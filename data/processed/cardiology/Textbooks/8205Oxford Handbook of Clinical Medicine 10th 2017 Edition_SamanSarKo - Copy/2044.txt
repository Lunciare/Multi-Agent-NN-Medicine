the cause is myocardial infarction prompt reperfusion therapy is vital (see p796). • Manage in Coronary Care Unit, or ICU. • Investigation and treatment may need to be done concurrently. • Investigations: ECG, U&E, troponin, ABG, CXR, echocardiogram. If indicated, CT thorax (speak with radiologists, this can be protocolled for both aortic dissection and PE) . • Monitor: CVP, BP, ABG, ECG, urine output. Keep on cardiac monitor/telemetry. Record a 12-lead ECG every hour until the diagnosis is made. Consider a CVP line and an arte- rial line to monitor pressure, if these are in situ consider measuring cardiac output and volume status.3 Catheterize for accurate urine output. Cardiac tamponade Pericardial fl uid collects  intrapericardial pressure rises  heart cannot fi ll  pumping stops. Causes: Trauma, lung/breast cancer, pericarditis, myocardial infarct, bacteria, eg TB. Rarely: urea, radiation, myxoedema, dissecting aorta, SLE. Also coronary artery dissection (secondary to PCI) and/or ruptured ventricle. Signs: BP, JVP, and muffl ed heart sounds (Beck’s triad); JVP on inspiration (Kuss- maul’s sign); pulsus paradoxus (pulse fades on inspiration). Echocardiography may be diagnostic. CXR: globular heart; left heart border convex or straight; right cardio- phrenic angle <90°. ECG: electrical alternans (p154). Management: This can
