Effi cacy is reduced by: barbiturates, carbamaz epine, phenytoin, rifampicin. Avoid concurrent nephrotoxics: eg gen- tamicin. Concurrent NSAIDs augment hepatotoxicity—monitor LFT. Methotrexate An antimetabolite. Inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, which is in- volved in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines. See p547. Cyclophosphamide An alkylating agent. SE: marrow suppression (monitor FBC), nausea, infertility, teratogenic, haemorrhagic cystitis due to an irritative urinary metabolite. There is a slight risk of later developing bladder cancer or leukaemia. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 337766 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH Table 8.11 Side-eff ects of steroid use 377 System Adverse reactions Gastrointestinal Pancreatitis Candidiasis Oesophageal ulceration Peptic ulceration Musculoskeletal Myopathy Osteoporosis Fractures Growth suppression Endocrine Adrenal suppression Cushing’s syndrome CNS Aggravated epilepsy Depression; psychosis Eye Cataracts; glaucoma Papilloedema Immune Increased susceptibility to and severity of infections, eg chickenpox Steroids can also cause fever and WCC; steroids only rarely cause leucopenia. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 337777 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 9 Infectious diseases Contents What is life? 379 Infectious disease: an overview 380 Bacterial infection: Bacterial infection: an overview 382 Antibiotics 384 Antibiotics: summary tables 386 Gram-positive bacteria 388 Gram-negative bacteria 390 Tuberculosis (TB): presentation 392 Tuberculosis (TB): diagnosis and Fig 9.1 Leeuwenhoek’s microscope.
