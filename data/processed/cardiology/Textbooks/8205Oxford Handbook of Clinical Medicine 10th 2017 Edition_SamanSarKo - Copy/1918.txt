nephrogenic systemic fi brosis/ nephrogenic fi brosing dermopathy which causes generalized fi brosis which im- pairs movement and breathing—and which may be fatal. Aberrations in calcium- phosphate metabolism and erythropoietin treatment seem to increase risk. Other adverse reactions include headache, nausea, and local irritation at the site of in- jection, with idiosyncratic reaction reported in less than 1%. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 774488 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR Imaging the acutely unwell patient 749 Asking yourself ‘Does this investigation need to be done right now?’ will often yield the answer ‘No!’, yet there are a few occasions when early imaging can provide vital diagnostic information and infl uence the prognosis for a patient: • Acute cauda equina syndrome (p466): MRI lumbar spine. • Suspected thoracic aorta dissection (p655): CT thorax + IV contrast, MRI or transoesophageal echo (TOE). The mediastinum is rarely widened on CXR. • Suspected leaking abdominal aortic aneurysm (p654): CT aorta. • Acute kidney injury (p298): US of renal tract to exclude obstruction. • Acute pulmonary oedema: portable CXR: don’t delay to get an ideal fi lm. • Acute abdomen with signs of peritonism: erect CXR to fi nd intraperitoneal free gas (fi g 13.26, p607; ≈ GI perforation). Remember: post-op there
