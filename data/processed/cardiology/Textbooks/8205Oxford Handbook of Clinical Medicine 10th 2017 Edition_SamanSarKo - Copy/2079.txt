For uncontrolled oesophageal variceal bleeding, a Seng- staken–Blakemore tube may compress the varices, but should only be placed by someone with experience. Acute drug therapy: There is no role for routine administration of PPI pre-endoscopy (provided endoscopy can be arranged in a timely manner). In patients undergoing successful endoscopic haemostasis, give PPI (eg omeprazole 40mg/12h IV/PO). Treat if positive for H. pylori (p253). Rebleeds Serious event: 40% of
