indwelling IV lines, infected skin, or pneumonia (present in up to 50% of those with pneumococcal arthritis)?10 Treatment If in doubt start empirical IV antibiotics (after aspiration) until sensi- tivities are known. Common causative organisms are Staph. aureus, streptococci, Neisseria gonococcus, and Gram Ωve bacilli. Follow local guidelines for antibiotic choice and contact microbiology for advice for all complex cases/immunosup- pressed patients (eg HIV). Consider fl ucloxacillin 2g QDS IV (clindamycin if penicillin allergic); Vancomycin IV plus 2nd- or 3rd-generation cephalosporin, eg cefuroxime if MRSA risk; 2nd- or 3rd-generation cephalosporin if Gram Ωve organisms suspected.11 For suspected gonococcus or meningococcus, consider ceftriaxone. Antibiotics are required for a prolonged period, conventionally ~2 weeks IV, then if patient improv- ing 2–4 weeks PO.12 Consider orthopaedic review for arthrocentesis, washout, and debridement; always urgently refer patients with prosthetic joint involvement. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 554444 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolotamuehR Prescribing NSAIDS: benefi t vs risk profi ling 545 Around 60% of patients will respond to any NSAID, but there is considerable vari- ation in response and tolerance—if one isn’t eff ective, try another. Mainly act as analgesics rather than modifying the disease process per se. NSAIDs caused ~2000 UK deaths in 2011.13 Individualized risk: benefi t analysis
