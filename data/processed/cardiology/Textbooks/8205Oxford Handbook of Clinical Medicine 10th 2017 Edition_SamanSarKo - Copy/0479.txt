LABA alone may exacerbation rates, but no excess hospitalizations or mortality; steroid inhalers alone are associated with mortality (by 33%) compared with steroids + LABA. 44 Steroid inhalers may risk of pneumonia, but when combined with LABA, advantages outweigh disadvantages. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 118855 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem tsehC 186 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ARDS, or acute lung injury, may be caused by direct lung injury or occur secondary to severe systemic illness. Lung damage and release of infl ammatory mediators cause increased capillary permeability and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, often ac- companied by multiorgan failure. Causes Pulmonary: Pneumonia; gastric aspiration; inhalation; injury; vasculitis (p556); contusion. Other: Shock; septicaemia; haemorrhage; multiple transfusions; DIC (p352); pancreatitis; acute liver failure; trauma; head injury; malaria; fat embo- lism; burns; obstetric events (eclampsia; amniotic fl uid embolus); drugs/toxins (as- pirin, heroin, paraquat). Clinical features Cyanosis; tachypnoea; tachycardia; peripheral vasodilation; bilat- eral fi ne inspiratory crackles. Investigations FBC, U&E, LFT, amylase, clotting, CRP, blood cultures, ABG.
