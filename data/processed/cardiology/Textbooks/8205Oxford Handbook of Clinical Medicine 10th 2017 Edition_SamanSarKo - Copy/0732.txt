after 5yrs; although graft failure can occur as a result of recurrence, it is rare and unpredictable. Prognosis Highly variable. The Mayo survival model is a validated predictor of survival that combines age, bilirubin, albumin, PT time, oedema, and need for diuretics. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) Progressive cholestasis with bile duct infl ammation and strictures (fi gs 6.30, 6.31). Symptoms/signs Pruritus ± fatigue; if advanced: ascending cholangitis, cirrh osis, and hepatic failure. Associations: •  sex. • HLA-A1; B8; DR3. • AIH (p284); >80% of Northern European patients also have IBD, usually UC; this combination is associated with risk of colorectal malignancy. Cancers Bile duct, gallbladder, liver, and colon cancers are more common, so do yearly colonoscopy + ultrasound; consider cholecystectomy for gallbladder polyps.32 Tests ALP, then bilirubin; hyper gammaglobulin aemia and/or IgM; AMA Ωve, but ANA, SMA, and ANCA may be +ve; see BOX and p553. ERCP (fi g 6.30) or MRCP (fi g 6.31) reveal duct anatomy and damage. Liver biopsy shows a fi brous, obliterative cholangitis. Treatment Liver transplant is the mainstay for end-stage disease; recurrence oc- curs in up to 30%; 5yr graft survival is >60%. Prognosis is worse for those with IBD, as 5–10% develop
