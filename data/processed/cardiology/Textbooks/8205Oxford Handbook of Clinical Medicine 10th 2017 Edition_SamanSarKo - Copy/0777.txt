hours (unless cause obvious or AKI improving). Small kidneys (<9cm) suggest CKD. Asymmetry may suggest renal vascular disease • Check liver function (hepatorenal) • Check platelets—if low need blood fi lm to check for haemolysis (HUS/TTP) • Investigate for intrinsic renal disease if indicated: immunoglobulins, paraprotein, complement, autoantibodies (ANA, ANCA, anti-GBM) Support • Treat sepsis (p792) • Stop nephrotoxic medication—NSAIDS, ACE-i, ARB, aminoglycosides • Stop drugs that may complications: diuretics (especially K+-sparing), met- formin, antihypertensives • Check all drug dosages are appropriate for renal impairment • Consider gastroprotection (H2 antagonist, PPI) and nutritional support • Avoid radiological contrast (or risk: p319). Fig 7.3 The clinical approach to AKI.3 Referring to the renal team Request that advice/review is necessary due to: • AKI not responding to treatment • AKI with complications: K+, acidosis, fl uid overload • stage 3 AKI (table 7.3) • AKI with diffi cult fl uid balance (eg hypoalbuminaemia, heart failure, pregnancy) • AKI due to possible intrinsic renal disease (table 7.4) • AKI with hypertension.
