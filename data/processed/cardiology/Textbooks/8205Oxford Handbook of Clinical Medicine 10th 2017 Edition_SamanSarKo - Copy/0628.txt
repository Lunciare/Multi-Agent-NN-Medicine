defi ciency (scurvy, p268), acute myeloid leukaemia (p356), or Vincent’s angina (p712). Microstomia (fi g 6.5) The mouth is too small, eg from thickening and tightening of the perioral skin after burns or in epidermolysis bullosa (destructive skin and mucous membrane blisters ± ankyloglossia) or systemic sclerosis (p552). Oral pigmentation Perioral brown spots characterize Peutz–Jeghers’ (p708). Pig- mentation anywhere in the mouth suggests Addison’s disease (p226) or drugs (eg anti malarials). Consider malignant melanoma. Telangiectasia: Systemic sclerosis; Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome (p708). Fordyce glands: (Creamy yellow spots at the border of the oral mucosa and the lip vermilion.) Sebaceous cysts, common and benign. Aspergillus niger colonization may cause a black tongue. Teeth (fi g 6.6) A blue line at the gum–tooth margin suggests lead poisoning. Pre- natal or childhood tetracycline exposure causes a yellow–brown discolouration. Tongue This may be furred or dry (xerostomia) in dehydration, drug therapy,3 after radiotherapy, in Crohn’s disease, Sjögren’s (p710), and Mikulicz’s syndrome (p706). Glossitis: Means a smooth, red, sore tongue, eg caused by iron, folate, or B12 defi - ciency (fi g 8.27, p335). If local loss of papillae leads to ulcer-like lesions that change in colour and size, use the term geographic tongue (harmless migratory glossitis).
