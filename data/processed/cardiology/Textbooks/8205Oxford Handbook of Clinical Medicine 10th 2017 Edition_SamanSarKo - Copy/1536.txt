2–3 days pre-operatively. Discuss with the diabetes team. • If eating and drinking post-operatively: on AM list, omit morning medication and take any missed drugs with lunch, after surgery. If PM list, take normal medications with breakfast, omit midday doses, and take any missed drugs with a late lunch. The dose of these may need reducing, depending on dietary intake. • If not eating or drinking post-op, start a VRIII 2 hours prior to surgery. Once eating and drinking, oral hypoglycaemics can be restarted. • Some patients may need a phase of subcutaneous insulin following major sur- gery—refer to the diabetes team if serum glucose levels are persistently raised. • Metformin and iodine IV contrast: Metformin can be continued after IV contrast in patients with normal serum creatinine and/or eGFR >60mL/min. To minimize the risk of nephrotoxicity, if serum creatinine is raised or eGFR <60mL/min, stop met- formin for 48h after contrast and check renal function has returned to baseline before restarting. Diet-controlled diabetes There are usually no problems; patients should be treated as if not diabetic (and do not need to be fi rst on the list). Check capillary blood glucose peri-operatively. Avoid 5% glucose IVI as this increases
