and therapies will apply: includ- ing arrhythmias (p124), heart failure (p134), and infective endocarditis (p150). Investigations Echocardiography (± bubble contrast) is fi rst line. Increasingly, car- diac CT and MR are used to provide precise anatomical and functional information. Cardiac catheterization generates data on oxygen saturation and pressure in diff er- ent vessels and chambers. Exercise testing assesses functional capacity. A few of the more common ACHDs are discussed below: Bicuspid aortic valve These work well at birth and go undetected. Many even- tually develop aortic stenosis (needing valve replacement) ± aortic regurgitation predisposing to IE/SBE ± aortic dilatation/dissection. Intense exercise may accelerate complications, so do yearly echocardiograms on aff ected athletes. 70 Atrial septal defect (ASD) A hole connects the atria. • Ostium secundum defects: 80% cases; hole high in the septum; often asymptomat- ic until adulthood when a LR shunt develops. Shunting depends on the compliance of the ventricles. LV compliance decreases with age (esp. if BP), so augmenting LR shunting; hence dyspnoea/heart failure, typically aged 40–60yrs. • Ostium primum defects: associated with AV valve anomalies, eg in Down’s syn- drome; present in childhood. Signs and symptoms: Chest pain, palpitations, dyspnoea. Arrhythmias incl. AF; JVP; wide, fi xed
