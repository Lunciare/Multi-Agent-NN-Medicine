arrhythmias, eg immediately post-STEMI. Exercise ECGs: The patient exercises according to a standardized protocol (eg Bruce on a treadmill) and the BP and ECG are monitored, looking for ischaemic changes, arrhythmias, and features suggestive of arrhythmia risk, such as delta waves. Holter monitors: The patient wears an ECG monitor which records their rhythm for 24h–7d whilst they go about their normal life, this is later analysed. These can also be used to pick up ST changes suggestive of ischaemia. Loop recorders: These record only when activated by the patient— they cleverly save a small amount of ECG data before the event—use- ful if the arrhythmia causes loss of consciousness: the patient can press the button when they wake up. Loop recorders may be im- planted just under the skin (eg Re- veal® or the newer, injectable LINQ device), and are especially useful in patients with infrequent episodes as they can continually monitor for months or years awaiting an event (Fig 3.25). Fig 3.25 This is a recording from a loop recorder, each Pacemakers and ICDs: These re- line follows on from the one above. This tracing was cord details of cardiac electrical recorded at the time of a syncopal episode,
