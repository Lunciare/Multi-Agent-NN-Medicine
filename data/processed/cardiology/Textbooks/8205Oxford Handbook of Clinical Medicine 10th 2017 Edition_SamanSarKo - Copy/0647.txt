If refl ux is prolonged, it may cause oesoph agitis (fi g 6.16), benign oesophageal stricture, or Barrett’s oesophagus (fi g 6.17 and p695; it is pre-malignant). Causes Lower oesophageal sphincter hypoten- sion, hiatus hernia (see BOX), oesophageal dysmotility (eg systemic sclerosis), obesity, gastric acid hypersecretion, delayed gastric emptying, smoking, alcohol, pregnancy, drugs (tricyclics, antic holinergics, nitrates), Helicobacter pylori?9 Symptoms Oesophageal: Heartburn (burning, retrosternal discomfort after meals, lying, stooping, or straining, relieved by antacids); belching; acid brash (acid or bile regurgitation); waterbrash ( salivation: ‘My mouth fi lls with saliva’); odynophagia (painful swallowing, eg from oesophagitis or ulceration). Extra-oesophageal: Nocturnal asthma, chronic cough, laryngitis (hoarseness, throat clearing), sinusitis. Complications Oesophagitis, ulcers, benign stricture, iron-defi ciency. Metaplasia dysplasianeoplasia: GORD may lead to Barrett’s oesophagus (p695; distal oe- sophageal epithelium undergoes metaplasia from squamous to columnar, fi g 6.17). 0.1–0.4%/yr of those with Barrett’s progress to oesophageal cancer (higher if dys- plasia is present).  Oesophagitis from corrosives, NSAIDS, herpes,
