can be laid open and packed individually, or skin fl aps can be used to cover the defect. Off er hygiene and hair removal advice. Rectal prolapse The mucosa (partial/type 1), or all layers (complete/type 2—more common), may protrude through the anus. Incontinence in 75%. It is due to a lax sphincter, prolonged straining, and related to chronic neurological and psychological disorders. : Abdominal approach: fi x rectum to sacrum (rectopexy) ± mesh inser- tion ± rectosigmoidectomy. Laparoscopic rectoplexy is as eff ective as open repair. Perineal approach: Delorme’s procedure (resect close to dentate line and suture mucosal boundaries), anal encirclement with a Thiersch wire. Perianal warts Condylomata acuminata (viral warts) are treated with podophyllo- toxin or imiquimod or cryotherapy/surgical excision. Giant condylomata acuminata of Buschke & Loewenstein may evolve into verrucous cancers (low-grade, non-me- tastasizing). Condylomata lata secondary to syphilis is treated with penicillin. Proctalgia fugax Idiopathic, intense, brief, stabbing/crampy rectal pain, often worse at night. The mainstay of treatment is reassurance. Inhaled salbutamol or topical GTN (0.2–0.4%) or topical diltiazem (2%) may help. Anal ulcers Consider Crohn’s, anal cancer, lymphogranuloma venerum, TB, syphilis. Skin tags Seldom cause trouble but are easily excised. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 663300 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Anal
