rising. Typical patient  >70yrs old. Risk factors Smoking, alcohol, carcinogens, DM, chronic pancreatitis, waist circumference (ie adiposity), and possibly a high-fat and red or processed meat diet. Pathology Mostly ductal adenocarcinoma (meta stasize early; present late). 60% arise in the pancreas head, 25% in the body, 15% tail. A few arise in the ampulla of Vater (ampullary tumour) or pancreatic islet cells (insulinoma, gastrinoma, glucagonomas, somatostatinomas (p223), VIPomas); both have a better prognosis. Genetics ~95% have mutations in the KRAS2 gene. The patient Tumours in the head of the pancreas present with painless obstruc- tive jaundice. 75% of tumours in the body and tail present with epigastric pain (ra- diates to back and relieved by sitting forward). Either may cause anorexia, weight loss, diabetes, or acute pancreatitis. Rarer features: Thrombophlebitis migrans (eg an arm vein becomes swollen and red, then a leg vein); Ca2+; marantic endocardi- tis; portal hypertension (splenic vein thrombosis); nephrosis (renal vein metasta- ses). Signs: Jaundice + palpable gallbladder (Courvoisier’s ‘law’, p272); epigastric mass; hepatomegaly; splenomegaly; lymphadenopathy; ascites. Tests Blood: Cholestatic jaundice. CA 19–9 (p531) is non-specifi c, but helps assess prognosis. Imaging: US or CT can show a pancreatic mass ± dilated biliary tree ±
