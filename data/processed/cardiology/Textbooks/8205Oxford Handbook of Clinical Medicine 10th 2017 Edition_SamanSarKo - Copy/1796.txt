‘Signs that may distinguish variant CJD’). Inherited forms: (eg Gerstmann–Sträussler–Scheinker syndrome, P102L mutation in PRNP gene with ataxia ± self-mutilation), the ‘normal’ protein is too unstable, readily trans forming to PrPSc. Iatrogenic causes: Cont aminated surgical instruments, corneal transplants, growth hormone from human pituitaries, and blood (vCJD only).17 Prion protein resists sterilization. Signs: Progressive dementia, focal CNS signs, myoclonus (present in 95%),18 depression, eye signs (diplopia, supranuclear palsies, complex visual disturbances, homonymous fi eld defects, hallucinations, cortical blindn ess).19 Tests: Tonsil/olfactory mucosa biopsy;20 CSF gel electrophoresis; MRI. Treatment: None proven. Death occurs in ~6 months in sporadic CJD (a little slower in variant CJD). Prevention: Regulations to  spread of BSE and transmission to humans +  iatrogenic transmission. Hans G Creutzfeldt, 1885–1964 (German pathologist); Alfons M Jakob 1884–1931 (German neurologist) Crigler–Najjar syndrome Two rare syndromes of inherited unconjugated hyper- bilirubinaemia presenting in the 1st days of life with jaundice ± CNS signs. Cause: Mutation in UGT enzyme activity causing absent (type 1) or impaired (type 2; mild) ability to excrete bilirubin. : T1: phototherapy and plasmapheresis to control jaun- dice; liver transplant before irreversible kernicterus (OHCS p115) develops.21 T2: usually no  needed.
