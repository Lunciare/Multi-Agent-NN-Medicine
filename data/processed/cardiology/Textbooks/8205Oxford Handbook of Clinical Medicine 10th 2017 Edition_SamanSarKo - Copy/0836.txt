the lowest dose of low/iso-osmolar contrast. Rhabdomyolysis Results from skeletal muscle breakdown, with release of intracellular contents (K+, myoglobin) into the extracellular space. Cytokines and nitric oxide cause renal vasoconstriction. Myoglobin is fi ltered by the glomeruli causing obstruction and infl ammation. Presentation: History of trauma, surgery, immobility, hyperthermia, seizures. Muscle pain, swelling, tenderness. AKI. Red-brown urine. Diagnosis: Serum myoglobin: short half-life, may be missed. Plasma CK ≈5 upper limit. Myoglobinuria (tea- or cola-coloured urine) is falsely +ve for blood on dipstick with no RBC seen on microscopy. K+, PO43Ω, Ca2+. Treatment: Supportive. Urgent treatment for hyper- kalaemia (p301). IV fl uid rehydration: maintain urine output 300mL/h until myoglobi- nuria has ceased; up to 1.5L fl uid/h may be needed. If oliguric, monitor CVP in HDU/ICU setting. Renal replacement may be needed. (Alkalinization of urine hypothesized to crystallization and toxic metabolites but no RCT evidence to support use over other crystalloids and beware Ca2+.) Urate nephropathy In acute crystal nephropathy, uric acid crystals precipitate within the tubulointer- stitium causing GFR and secondary infl ammation. Seen in tumour lysis syndrome when a high tumour burden and sensitivity to chemotherapy cause uric acid which precipitates in association with phosphate. In addition, serum
