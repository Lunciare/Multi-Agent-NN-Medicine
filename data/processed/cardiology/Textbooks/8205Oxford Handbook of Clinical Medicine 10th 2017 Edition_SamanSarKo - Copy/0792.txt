of ESA treatment due to anti-erythropoietin antibodies and usually causes Hb <60g/L: exclude more common causes of anaemia fi rst. Acidosis: Consider sodium bicarbonate supplements for patients with eGFR <30 and low serum bicarbonate (<20mmol/L). Caution in patients with hypertension and fl uid overload due to sodium component. Oedema: Restrict fl uid and sodium intake. High doses of loop diuretics may be need- ed. Combination of a loop and thiazide diuretic can have a powerful eff ect: distal tubule sodium excretion (and its inhibition with a thiazide) is more signifi cant when already treated with a loop diuretic (fi g 7.13). Diuretic treatment should only be given with careful monitoring of fl uid state and renal function. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 330044 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR CKD bone-mineral disorders: CKD causes  in serum phosphate and reduced hy- 305 droxlyation of vitamin D by the kidney. Measure calcium, phosphate, ALP, PTH, and 25-OH vit D if eGFR <30. • Treat if phosphate >1.5mmol/L (>1.7mmol/L if RRT) with dietary restriction ± phos- phate binders. The use of binders which do not contain calcium may be benefi cial in preventing vascular calcifi cation. • Give vitamin D supplements (colecalciferol, ergocalciferol) if defi cient. If PTH
