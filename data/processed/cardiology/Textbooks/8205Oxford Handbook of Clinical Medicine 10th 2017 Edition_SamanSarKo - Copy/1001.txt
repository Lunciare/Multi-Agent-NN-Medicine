Vancomycin resistance also exists and is classifi ed according to the amount of vancomycin needed to inhibit bacterial growth: vancomycin-intermediate Staph. aureus (VISA) and vancomy- cin-resistant Staph. aureus (VRSA). Resistant staphylococci cause  morbidity and mortality compared to sensitive strains. Risk factors for colonization include: antibiotic exposure, hospital stay, surgery, nursing home residence. Treatment of infection (not colonization): vancomycin (for MRSA), teicoplanin. Oral agents with activity against MRSA include clindamycin, co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, linezolid. Prevention: surveillance, barrier precautions, hand-hygiene, decolonization (mupi- rocin 2%, chlorhexidine, tea tree oil), antimicrobial stewardship. See p384, pp410–11. Streptococci: Classifi cation based on Lancefi eld group persists in terminology (fi g 9.5). Includes: • Streptococcus pyogenes (-haemolytic group A): colonizes throat, skin, anogenital tract. Range of infection: tonsillitis, pharyngitis, scarlet fever, impetigo, erysipelas, cellulitis, pneumonia, peripartum sepsis, necrotizing fasciitis. All canstreptococcal toxic shock = sudden-onset BP, multiorgan failure. Post-infectious complications rare: rheumatic fever (p142), glomerulonephritis (p310). Treatment: penicillin. • Streptococcus agalactiae (-haemolytic group B): neonatal and peurperal infec- tion, skin, soft tissue. Invasive disease (bacteraemia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, meningitis) usually has risk factors: DM, malignancy, chronic dis- ease. Treatment: penicillin, macrolide, cephalosporin, chloramphenicol. • Streptococcus milleri: if found in blood culture look for an abscess—mouth, liver,
