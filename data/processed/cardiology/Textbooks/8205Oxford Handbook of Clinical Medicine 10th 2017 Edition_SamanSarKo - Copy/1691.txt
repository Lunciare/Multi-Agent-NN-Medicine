True aneurysms are abnor mal dilatations that involve all layers of the arterial wall. False aneurysms (pseudoaneurysms) involve a collec- tion of blood in the outer layer only (adventitia) whichcommunicates with the lumen (eg after trauma). Ane ury sms may be fusiform (eg most AAAS) or sac-like (eg Berry aneurysms; fi g 10.17 p479). Causes Atheroma, trauma, infection (eg mycotic aneurysm in endocarditis; tertiary syphilis—especially thoracic aneurysms), connective tissue disorders (eg Marfan’s, Ehlers–Danlos), infl ammatory (eg Takayasu’s aortitis, p712). Common sites Aorta (infrarenal most common),iliac,femoral, and popliteal arteries. Complications Rupture;thrombosis;embolism; fi stulae;pressure on other structures.
