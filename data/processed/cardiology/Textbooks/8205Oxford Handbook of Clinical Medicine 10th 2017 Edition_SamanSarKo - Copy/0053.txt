by having little interest or pleasure in doing things? If a person answers ‘yes’ to either question they should undergo mental health as- sessment including a risk assessment of self-harm and suicide. Appropriate treat- ments include psychosocial intervention (guided self-help, cognitive behavioural therapy, structured physical activity) and medication. Treatment choice depends on disease severity, previous psychiatric history, response to treatment, and patient preference. If medication is indicated, a generic SSRI should be considered fi rst line after consideration of GI bleeding risk, drug interactions, toxicity, overdose, and dis- continuation symptoms. The full eff ect of medication is gradual, over 4–6 weeks. Capacity The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005 has a two-stage test for lack of capacity: 1 There is an impairment or disturbed functioning of the mind. 2 The patient is unable to make a decision. Decision-making is impaired if the patient is unable to: understand the relevant information, retain it for long enough to make a decision, weigh up the informa- tion, communicate their decision. Capacity is decision-specifi c not patient-specifi c. When treatment is proposed to those who lack capacity, a capacity advocate should be provided. Even patients without capacity should be as involved as possible in decision-making.
