and troponin, to the ‘heart-ache’ of the literary and philosophical kinds. (a) (b) Fig 3.43 (a) Left ventriculogram of a heart in diastole. (b) The same patient’s heart in systole. The apex is ballooning whilst the base contracts, causing ineffi cient pumping and a risk of rup- ture. This pattern is classic of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 114455 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 146 Aortic valve disease Aortic stenosis (AS) Causes: Senile calcifi cation is the commonest. 57 Others: con- genital (bicuspid valve, Williams syndrome, p149), rheumatic heart disease. Presentation: Think of AS in any elderly person with chest pain, exertional dysp- noea, or syncope. The classic triad includes angina, syncope, and heart failure. Also: dyspnoea; dizziness; faints; systemic emboli if infective endocarditis; sudden death. Signs: Slow rising pulse with narrow pulse pressure (feel for diminished and delayed carotid upstroke—parvus et tardus); heaving, non-displaced apex beat; LV heave; aortic thrill; ejection systolic murmur (heard at the base, left sternal edge and the aortic area, radiates to the carotids). S1 is usually normal. As stenosis worsens, A2 is increasingly delayed, giving fi rst a single S2 and then reversed splitting. But this sign is rare. More common is a quiet A2. In severe
