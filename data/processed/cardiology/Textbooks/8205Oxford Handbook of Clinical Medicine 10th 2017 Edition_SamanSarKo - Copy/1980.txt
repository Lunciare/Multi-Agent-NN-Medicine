It should only be done in absolute ‘can’t intubate, can’t ventilate’ situations, ie where ventilation is impossible with a bag and mask (± airway adjuncts) and where there is an immediate threat to life. If not, call anaes- thetics or ENT for immediate help. Indications Upper airway obstruction when endotracheal intubation not possible, eg
