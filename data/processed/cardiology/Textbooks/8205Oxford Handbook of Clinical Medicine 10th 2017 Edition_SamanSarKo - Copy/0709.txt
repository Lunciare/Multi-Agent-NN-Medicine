the cause. 27 Urea is synthesized in the liver, so is a poor test of renal function in liver failure; use creatinine instead. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 227744 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG Prescribing in liver failure 275 Avoid drugs that constipate (risk of encephalopathy), oral hypoglycaemics, and saline-containing IVIs. Warfarin eff ects are enhanced. Hepatotoxic drugs include paracetamol, methotrexate, isoniazid, azathioprine, phenothiazines, oestrogen, 6-mercaptopurine, salicylates, tetracycline, mitomycin. Hepatic encephalopathy: letting loose some false neurotransmitters As the liver fails, nitrogenous waste (as ammonia) builds up in the circulation and passes to the brain, where astrocytes clear it (by processes involving the conversion of glutamate to glutamine). This excess glutamine causes an osmotic imbalance and a shift of fl uid into these cells—hence cerebral oedema. Grading: I Altered mood/behaviour; sleep disturbance (eg reversed sleep pattern); dysp- raxia (‘Please copy this 5-pointed star’); poor arithmetic. No liver fl ap. II Increasing drowsiness, confusion, slurred speech ± liver fl ap, inappropriate behaviour/personality change (ask the family—don’t be too tactful). III Incoherent; restless; liver fl ap; stupor. IV Coma. What else could be clouding consciousness? Hypoglycaemia; sepsis; trauma; postictal. What is hepatorenal syndrome (HRS)? Cirrhosis + ascites + renal failure ≈ HRS—if other causes of renal impairment have been
