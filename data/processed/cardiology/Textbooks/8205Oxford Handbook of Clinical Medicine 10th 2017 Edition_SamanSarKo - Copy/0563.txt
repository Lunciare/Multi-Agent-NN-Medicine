to conceive). If the patient does not fall into any of these categories, monitor TSH yearly. • Risks from well-monitored treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism are small (but there is an risk of atrial fi brillation and osteoporosis if over-treated). Subclinical hyperthyroidism occurs when TSH, with normal T4 and T3. There is a 41% increase in relative mortality from all causes versus euthyroid control subjects—eg from AF and osteoporosis. Management: • Confi rm that suppressed TSH is persistent (recheck in 2–4 months). • Check for a non-thyroidal cause: illness, pregnancy, pituitary or hypothalamic insuffi ciency (suspect if T4 or T3 are at the lower end of the reference range), use of TSH-suppressing medication, eg thyroxine, steroids. • If TSH <0.1, treat on an individual basis, eg with symptoms of hyperthyroidism, AF, unexplained weight loss, osteoporosis, goitre. • Options are carbimazole or propylthiouracil—or radioiodine therapy. • If no symptoms, recheck 6-monthly.
