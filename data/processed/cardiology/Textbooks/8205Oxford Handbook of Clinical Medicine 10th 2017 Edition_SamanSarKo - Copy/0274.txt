Then (see fi g 3.3): • Rate: At usual speed (25mm/s) each ‘big square’ is 0.2s; each ‘small square’ is 0.04s. To calculate the rate, divide 300 by the number of big squares between two con- secutive R waves (table 3.1). The normal rate is 60–100bpm. • Rhythm: If cycles are not clearly regular, use the ‘card method’: lay a card along the ECG, marking positions of three successive R waves. Slide the card
