ected males), and 11% for ovarian cancer. Mutations are also linked to prostate, peritoneal, and pancreatic cancers. TP53 mutations (somatic >inherited) also confer a risk of breast cancer. Refer if: • 1st-degree relative with: breast cancer <40yrs, male breast cancer, bilateral breast cancer <50yrs • 1st- and 2nd-degree relative with breast cancer or ovarian cancer • three 1st- or 2nd-degree relatives with breast cancer • risk assessment calculation of >3% risk in 10yrs or lifetime risk ≥17% • other: Ashkenazi ancestry, sarcoma <45yrs, multiple cancers at a young age. Genetic counselling and testing for BRCA1, BRCA2, and TP53 mutations is off ered if calculated risk of mutation is >10%. If known BRCA1/2 mutation, off er women annual MRI 30–49yrs and annual mammograpy 50–69yrs (MRI 20–69yrs if TP53 mutation). Pro- phylactic tamoxifen or raloxifene may be appropriate depending on tolerance and VTE/endometrial cancer risk. Surgical management (mastectomy/oophorectomy) should only be via a specialist MDT. Colorectal cancer ~25% have a family history. ~5% have identifi ed mutations. Refer to specialist genet- ic service if: two 1st-degree relatives with colorectal cancer at average age <60yrs, or if criteria for an autosomal dominant colorectal cancer syndrome is met: • Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal
