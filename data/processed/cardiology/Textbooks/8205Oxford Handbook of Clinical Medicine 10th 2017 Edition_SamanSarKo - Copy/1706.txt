line of demarcation between living and dead tissue.14 : restoration of blood supply ± amputation. Wet gangrene is tissue death and infection (associated with discharge) occurring together (p213, fi g 5.10). : analgesia; broad-spectrum IV antibiotics; surgical debridement ± amputation. Gas gangrene is a subset of necrotizing myositis caused by spore-forming clostridial species. There is rapid onset of myonecrosis, muscle swelling, gas production, sepsis, and severe pain. Risk factors include diabetes, trauma, and malignancy. : remove all dead tissue (eg amputation). Give benzylpenicillin ± clindamycin. Hyperbaric O2 can improve survival and  the number of debridements. Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive infection of the deep fascia causing necrosis of subcutaneous tissue. Prompt recognition (diffi cult in the early stages) and aggressive treatment is required. In any atypical cellulitis, get early surgical help. There is intense pain over aff ected skin and underlying muscle. Group A -haemolytic streptococci is a major cause, although infection is often polymicrobial. Fournier’s gan- grene is necrotizing fasciitis localized to the scrotum and perineum. : Radical debride- ment ± amputation; IV antibiotics, eg benzylpenicillin and clindamycin. Skin ulcers Ulcers are abnormal breaks in an epithelial surface. Leg ulcers aff ect ~2% in devel- oped countries.
