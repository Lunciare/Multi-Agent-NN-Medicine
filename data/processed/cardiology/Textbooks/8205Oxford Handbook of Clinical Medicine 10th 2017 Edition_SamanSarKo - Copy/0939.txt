(DLBCL) is common- est. Not all centre on nodes (extranodal tissues generating lymphoma include muco- sa-associated lymphoid tissue, eg gastric MALT, later in topic). Incidence has doubled since 1970 (to 2: 10 000). Causes Immunodefi ciency—drugs; HIV (usually high-grade lymphoma from EBV transformed cells, p405); HTLV-1, p405; H. pylori; toxins; congenital. Signs and symptoms • Superfi cial lymphadenopathy (75% at presentation). • Extranodal disease (50%) Gut (commonest): 1 Gastric MALT is caused by H. pylori, and may regress with its eradication (p252). Symptoms: as for gastric Ca (p619), with systemic features (see below). MALT usually involves the antrum, is multifocal, and metastasizes late. 2 Non-MALT gastric lymphomas (60%) are usually diff use large-cell B lymphomas—high-grade and not responding well to H. pylori eradi- cation. 3 Small-bowel lymphomas eg IPSID (immunoproliferative small intestine disease p370), or EATCL (enteropathy/coeliac-associated intra-epithelial T-cell lym- phoma)—presents with diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and weight. Poor prognosis. Skin: (2nd commonest—see fi g 8.62) Eg clonal T cells in mycosis fungoi- des (accounts for ~50%—p596). Oropharynx: Waldeyer’s ring lymphoma causes sore throat/obstructed breathing. Other possible sites: Bone, CNS, and lung. • Systemic features—fever, night sweats, weight loss (less common than in Hodg- kin’s lymphoma, and indicates disseminated disease).
