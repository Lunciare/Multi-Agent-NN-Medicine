Prevention: Approaches include genetic counselling or antenatal diagnosis using fetal blood or DNA, then ‘therapeutic’ abortion. The  thalassaemias (fi g 8.41) There are two separate -globin genes on each chromosome 16  there are four genes (termed /). The  thalassaemias are mainly caused by gene deletions. If all four  genes are deleted (--/--), death is in utero (Bart’s hydrops). Here, HbBarts (4) is present, which is physiologically use- less. HbH disease occurs if three genes are deleted (--/-); there may be moderate anaemia and features of haemolysis: hepatosplenomegaly, leg ulcers, and jaun- dice. In the blood fi lm, there is formation of 4 tetramers (=HbH) due to excess  chains, HbBarts, HbA, and HbA2. If two genes are deleted (--/ or -/-), there is an asymptomatic carrier state, with MCV. With one gene
