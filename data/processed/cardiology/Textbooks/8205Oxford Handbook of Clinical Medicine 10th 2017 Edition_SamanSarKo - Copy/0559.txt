ciency. • Post-thyroidectomy or radioiodine treatment. • Drug-induced: Antithyroid drugs, amiodarone, lithium, iodine. • Subacute thyroiditis: Temporary hypothyroidism after hyperthyroid phase. Secondary hypothyroidism Not enough TSH (due to hypopituitarism); very rare. Hypothyroidism’s associations Autoimmune is seen with other autoimmune dis- eases (type 1 DM, Addison’s, and PA, p334). Turner’s and Down’s syndromes, cystic fi brosis, primary biliary cholangitis, ovarian hyperstimulation (OHCS p311); POEMS syn- drome—poly neuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, m-protein band (plasma- cytoma) + skin pigmentation/tethering. Genetic: Dyshormonogenesis: genetic (often autosomal recessive) defect in hormone synthesis, eg Pendred’s syndrome (with deaf- ness): there is uptake on isotope scan, which is displaced by potassium perchlorate. Pregnancy problems Eclamps ia, anaemia, prematurity, birthweight, stillbirth, PPH. Treatment • Healthy and young: Levothyroxine (T4), 0–100mcg/24h PO; review at 12wks. Ad- just 6-weekly by clinical state and to normalize but not suppress TSH (keep TSH >0.5mU/L). Thyroxine’s t½ is ~7d, so wait ~4wks before checking TSH to see if a dose change is right. NB: small changes in serum free T4 have a logarithmic eff ect on TSH. Once normal, check TSH yearly. Enzyme inducers (p689) metabolism of levothyroxine. • Elderly or ischaemic heart disease: Start with 25mcg/24h; dose by 25mcg/4wks according to TSH (cautiously, as
