be sparing in requesting these tests. Treatment Anticoagulate acute thrombosis (p350). If recurrence occurs with no other risk factors, consider lifelong anticoagulation. Recurrence whilst on treat- ment should be treated by increasing treatment intensity (eg target INR to 3–4). In antithrombin defi ciency, high doses of heparin may be needed; liaise with a hae- matologist. In protein C or S defi ciency, monitor treatment closely as skin necrosis may occur with warfarin. Prevention Lifelong anticoagulation is not needed in absence of VTE, but advise of risk with the oral contraceptive pill or HRT, and counsel as regards to the best form of contraception. Warn about other risk factors for VTE. Prophylaxis may be needed in pregnancy, eg in antiphospholipid syndrome (get expert help: aspirin and, sometimes, prophylactic heparin are used as warfarin is teratogenic, see OHCS p33). Prophylactic SC heparin may also be indicated in high-risk situations, eg pre- surgery. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 337744 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH Other risk factors for thrombosis 375 Arterial: Venous: • Smoking • Surgery • Hypertension • Trauma • Hyperlipidaemia • Immobility • Diabetes mellitus. • Pregnancy, oral contraceptive pill, HRT • Age • Obesity • Varicose veins • Other conditions: heart failure, malignancy, infl amma tory
