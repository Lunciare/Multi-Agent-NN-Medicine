assessed by examining the results from the test against a standard reference (or outcome: did the participant actually have the disease?) (see table 1.6). Sensitivity TP/(TP + FN) = of those with the condition, how many test positive? A sensi- tive test is able to correctly identify those with the disease. Specifi city TN/(TN + FP) = of those who do not have the condition, how many test negative? A specifi c test is able to correctly identify those without a disease. ‘Do they have abdominal pain?’ as a test for appendicitis will have sensitivity (most cases have pain), but specifi city (many patients with pain do not have appendicitis). Positive predictive value (TP/(TP + FP) indicates how likely it is that someone with a positive test result has the condition. Negative predictive value (TN/(TN + FN) indicates how likely it is that someone with a negative test result does not have the condition. When you receive a test result, you need to know how likely it is to be correct.
