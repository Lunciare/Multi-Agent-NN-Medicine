factor for coronary artery disease, p117), demonstrate car- diac anatomy including congenital anomalies, and estimate ventricular function. Vascular CT: Has become routine in emergency assessment of suspected dissections, ruptured aneurysms, and arterial and venous thromboses (fi g 16.29). CT angiog- raphy has overtaken invasive angi- ography in the assessment of many Fig 16.29 CT angiogram showing type A (ascend- conditions such as stable angina ing) aortic dissection with haemopericardium. and renal artery stenosis.

Catheter angiography Wherever intervention may be required, contrast studies such as angiography provide both image clarity and the possibility of proceeding to intervention, eg angioplasty or stenting of vessels, endovascular repair of an- eurysms, clipping/coiling of aneurysms (see p746). Remember that these have a high burden of both radiation and contrast medium, so check renal function before requesting. Complications include those of arterial puncture (bleeding, infection, thrombosis, dissection, pseudoaneurysm formation) plus cholesterol emboli, throm- boemboli, and vasospasm. MRI Cardiac MRI using ECG-gating to acquire the imaging data and relate it to the position in the cardiac cycle (best when the patient is in sinus rhythm) can reduce movement artefact and lead to excellent resolution images for functional assess- ment.
