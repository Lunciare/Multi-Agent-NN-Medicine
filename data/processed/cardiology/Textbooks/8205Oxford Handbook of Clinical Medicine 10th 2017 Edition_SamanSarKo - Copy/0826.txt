in up to 10%. Di- agnosis: >1.5cm asymmetry in renal size (but sensitivity and specifi city). Doppler studies of native kidneys not consistently accurate for diagnosis. CT or MR (avoids contrast) angiography. Treatment: Modifi cation of CV risk factors: statin, aspirin, antihypertensive treatment. Historically, ACE-i/ARB were considered contraindicated due to concern about renin–dependent renal perfusion and deterioration in function on ACE-i/ARB. However, mortality seen with ACE-i/ARB. eGFR by <25% ‘sacrifi ced’ for longer-term renal and cardiac outcome. Large RCTs of medical treatment vs revascu- larization have failed to show an advantage to revascularization  only considered in fl ash pulmonary oedema, rapid/oligo-anuric renal failure. Scleroderma renal crisis Occurs in ~5% of systemic sclerosis. Risk with: diff use disease, anti-RNA polymerase III antibodies and <2yr from diagnosis. Diagnosis: Accelerated hypertension (new >150/85mmHg) and AKI (eGFR by >30%). Biopsy: collapsed glomeruli, onion-skin thickening of arterioles. Treatment: ACE-i/ARB. IV vasodilators to vascular resistance and for digital ischaemia. Care with -blockers as HR compensating for stroke volume. May recover renal function after many months. Sickle cell nephropathy HbSS is associated with hyperfi ltration (lower than expected creatinine) and albumi- nuria. Although up to 75% of young patients will have some degree of CKD, progres-
