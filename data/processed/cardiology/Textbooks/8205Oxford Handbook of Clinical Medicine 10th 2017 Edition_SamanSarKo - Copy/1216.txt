drop: DM, common peroneal nerve palsy, stroke, prolapsed disc, MS. Weak legs with no sensory loss: MND, polio, para sagittal meningioma (an exception to the rule that weak legs mean cord or distal lesion). Chronic spastic paraparesis: MS, cord primary malignancy/metastasis, MND, syrin- gomyelia, subacute combined degeneration of the cord (p334), hereditary spastic paraparesis, taboparesis (tertiary syphilis, see p412), histiocytosis X, parasites (eg schistosomiasis). Chronic fl accid paraparesis: Peripheral neuro pathy, myopathy. Absent knee jerks and extensor plantars: (Ie combined LMN or UMN signs.) Com- bined cervical and lumbar disc disease, conus medullaris lesions, MND, myeloradicu- litis, Friedreich’s ataxia, subacute combined degeneration of the cord, taboparesis.4 4 Tertiary syphilis (p412): in tabes dorsalis the aff erent pathways from muscle spindles are lost, with reduced tone and tendon refl exes (without weakness). Later, additional involvement of the pyramidal tracts causes taboparesis—a spastic paraparesis with the peculiar combination of extensor plantars (from the taboparesis) and absent tendon reflexes (from the tabes dorsalis). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 446666 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN Gait disorders 467 Spastic: Stiff , circumduction of legs ± scuffi ng of the toe of the shoes: UMN lesions.
