pressure eff ect in 30%. 2 Acidophil 15%. Secrete GH or PRL. Local pressure eff ect in 10%. 3 Basophil 15%. Secrete ACTH. Local pressure eff ect rare. Symptoms are caused by pressure, hormones (eg galactorrhoea), or hypopituitarism (p232). FSH-secreting tumours can cause macro-orchidism in men, but are rare. Features of local pressure Headache, visual fi eld defects (bilateral temporal hemi- anopia, due to compression of the optic chiasm), palsy of cranial nerves III, IV, VI (pressure or invasion of the cavernous sinus; fi g 5.25). Also, diabetes insipidus (DI) (p240; more likely from hypothalamic disease); disturbance of hypothalamic centres of T°, sleep, and appetite; erosion through fl oor of sella leading to CSF rhinorrhoea. Tests MRI defi nes intra- and supra-sellar extension; accurate assessment of visual fi elds; screening tests: PRL, IGF-1 (p238), ACTH, cortisol, TFTS, LH/FSH, testosterone in , short Synacthen® test. Glucose tolerance test if acromegaly suspected (p238). If Cushing’s suspected, see p225. Water deprivation test if DI is suspected (p240). Treatment Start hormone replacement as needed (p232). Ensure steroids are given before levothyroxine, as thyroxine may precipitate an adrenal crisis. For Cushing’s disease see p225, prolactinoma p236, acromegaly p238. • Surgery: (fi g 5.26) Most pituitary
