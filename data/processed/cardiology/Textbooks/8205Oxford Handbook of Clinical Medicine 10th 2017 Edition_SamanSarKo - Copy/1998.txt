in an adult. • Set the pacing current at the lowest setting and turn on the pacemaker. • Increase the pacing current until electrical capture occurs (normally from 50– 100mA), which can be confi rmed by seeing a wide QRS complex and a T wave on the trace (ventricular electrical capture). • There will be some interference from skeletal muscle contraction on the ECG trace, as well as possible artefact, which could be mistaken for a QRS complex. The ab- sence of a T wave in the former is an important discriminator between the two. • CPR can continue with the pads in place, though only when the pacing unit is off. • Once adequate cardiac output has been maintained, seek expert help and ar- range transvenous pacing. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 777777 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 serudecorp lacitcarP 19 Emergencies Contents Emergency presentations: Headache 780 Breathlessness 782 Chest pain 784 Coma 786 The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 788 Shock 790 Sepsis 792 Anaphylactic shock 794 Cardiovascular emergencies: Acute coronary syndrome—with ST-elevation 796 Acute coronary syndrome—without ST- elevation 798 Severe pulmonary oedema 800 Cardiogenic shock 802 Broad complex tachycardia 804 Narrow complex tachycardia 806 Bradycardia 808 Respiratory emergencies: Acute severe asthma 810 Fig 19.1 Dr
