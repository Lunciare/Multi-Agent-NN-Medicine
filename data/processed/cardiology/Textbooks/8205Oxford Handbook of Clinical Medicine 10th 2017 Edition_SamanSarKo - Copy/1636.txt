of gravity (standing), increased anal tone (?stress), and the eff ects of straining at stool may make them become both bulky and loose, and so to protrude to form piles (Latin pila, meaning a ball). They are vulnerable to trauma (eg from hard stools) and bleed readily from the capillaries (bright red blood) of the underlying lamina propria. NB: piles are not varicose veins. As there are no sensory fi bres above the dentate line (squamomucosal junction), piles are not painful unless they thrombose when they protrude and are gripped by the anal sphincter, blocking venous return. See fi g 13.44. Diff erential diagnosis Perianal haematoma; anal fi ssure; abscess; tumour; proctalgia fugax. Never ascribe rectal bleeding to piles without examination or investigation. Causes Constipation with prolonged straining is a key factor. In many the bowel habit may be normal. Congestion from a pelvic tumour, pregnancy, CCF, or portal hypertension are important in only a minority of cases. Elicit red fl ags in history. Pathogenesis There is a vicious circle: vascular cushions protrude through a tight anus, become more congested, and hypertrophy to protrude again more readily. These protrusions may then strangulate.
