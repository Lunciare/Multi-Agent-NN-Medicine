you may precipitate man- ifestations of ischaemic heart disease. Alternative regimens involve levothyroxine. • Give hydrocortisone 100mg/8h IV—vital if pituitary hypothyroidism is suspected (ie no goitre, no previous radioiodine, and no previous thyroid surgery). • If infection suspected, give antibiotic, eg co-amoxiclav 1.2g/8h IV. • Caution with fl uid, rehydrate as needed but watch for cardiac dysfunction; BP may not respond to fl uid and inotropes may be needed. • Active warming (blankets, fl uids) may be needed for hypothermia. Beware compli- cations (hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, arrhythmias). See p848. Further : T3 5–20mcg/4–12h IV until sustained improvement (~2–3d) then levothyrox- ine 50mcg/24h PO. Hydrocortisone + IV fl uids as needed (hyponatraemia is dilutional). Hyperthyroid crisis (thyrotoxic storm) Signs and symptoms: :≈4:1. Severe hyper thyroidi sm (see p218): T°, agitation, confusion, coma, tachycardia, AF, D&V, goi- tre, thyroid bruit, acute abdomen (exclude surgical causes), heart failure. Precipitants: Recent thyroid surgery or radioiodine; infection; MI; trauma. Diagnosis: Do not wait for test results if urgent treatment is needed. Do TSH, free T4, and free T3. Confi rm with technetium uptake if possible. Treatment: See fi g 19.24. Seek endocrinology advice and aim to: 1 Counteract periph- eral eff ects of thyroid hormones. 2
