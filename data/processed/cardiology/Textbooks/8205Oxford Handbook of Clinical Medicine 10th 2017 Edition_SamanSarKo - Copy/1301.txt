or cranial nerves. Causes are usually local, such as trauma, or entrapment (eg tumour), except for carpal tunnel syndrome (see BOX ‘Car- pal tunnel syndrome’). Median nerve C6–T1 The median nerve is the nerve of precision grip—muscles in- volved are easier to remember if you use your ‘LOAF’ (two lumbricals, opponens pol- licis, abductor pollicis brevis, and flexor pollicis brevis). The clinical features depend on the location of the lesion: At the wrist: (Eg see BOX ‘Carpal tunnel syndrome’.) Weakness of abductor pollicis brevis and sensory loss over the radial 3½ fi ngers and palm. Anterior interosseous nerve lesions: (Eg trauma.) Weakness of fl exion of the distal phalanx of the thumb and index fi nger. Proximal lesions: (Eg compression at the elbow.) May show combined defects. Ulnar nerve C7–T1 Vulnerable to elbow trauma. Signs: Weakness/wasting of medial (ulnar side) wrist fl exors, interossei (cannot cross the fi nge rs in the good luck sign), and medial two lumbricals (claw hand, more marked in wrist lesions with digitorum profundus intact); hypothenar emine nce wasting, weak 5th digit abduction, and 4th and 5th DIP joint fl exion; sensory loss over medial 1½ fi ngers and ulnar side of the hand.
