metabolism). The syndrome has a similar molecular ba- sis to infantile Refsum’s syndrome, and although more severe, exhibits comparable biochemical abnormalities (p710). Clinical features include craniofacial abnormali- ties, severe hypotonia and mental retardation, glaucoma, cataracts, hepatomegaly, and renal cysts. A number of causative PEX gene mutations have been identifi ed. Life expectancy is usually a few months only. Hans Zellweger, 1909–1990 (US paediatrician) Zollinger–Ellison syndrome This is the association of peptic ulcers with a gastrin- secreting adenoma (gastrinoma). Gastrin excites excessive gastric acid production, which may produce multiple ulcers in the duodenum and stomach. The adenoma is usually found in the pancreas, although it may arise in the stomach or duodenum. Most cases are sporadic; 20% are associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1, p223). 60% are malignant; metastases are found in local lymph nodes and the liver. Symptoms: Include abdominal pain and dyspepsia, from the ulcer(s), and chronic diarrhoea due to inactivation of pancreatic enzymes (also causes steator- rhoea) and damage to intestinal mucosa. Incidence: ~0.1% of patients with peptic ulcer disease. Suspect in those with multiple peptic ulcers, ulcers distal to the duo- denum, or a family history of peptic ulcers (or of islet cell, pituitary, or
