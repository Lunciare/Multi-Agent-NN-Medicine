Candida prophylaxis are important (p246). • Check vital signs 4-hrly. High-calorie diet; avoid foods with high risk of microbial contamination. Vases containing cut fl owers pose a Pseudomonas risk. Use of antibiotics in neutropenia Treat any known infection promptly. • If T° >38°C or T° >37.5°C on two occasions, >1h apart, or the patient is septic, start blind combination therapy according to local guidelines—eg piperacillin– tazobactam—p386 (+ vancomycin, p386, if Gram +ve organisms suspected or iso- lated, eg Hickman line sepsis). Continue until afebrile for 72h or 5d course, and until neutrop hils >0.5≈109/L. If fever persists despite antibiotics, think of CMV, fungi (eg Candida; Aspergillus, p408) and central line infection. • Consider treatment for Pneumocystis (p400, eg co-trimoxazole, though beware as this can worsen neutropenia). Remember TB. Other dangers •Tumour lysis syndrome: Results in K+,  urate, and AKI. See p529. • Hyperviscosity: (p372). If WCC is >100 ≈ 109/L WBC thrombi may form in brain, lung, and heart (leukostasis). Avoid transfusing before lowering WCC, eg with hydroxycarbamide or leukaph eresis, as viscosity rises (risk of leukostasis). • DIC: The release of procoagulants into the circulation causes widespread activa- tion of coagulation, consuming clotting factors and platelets and causing
