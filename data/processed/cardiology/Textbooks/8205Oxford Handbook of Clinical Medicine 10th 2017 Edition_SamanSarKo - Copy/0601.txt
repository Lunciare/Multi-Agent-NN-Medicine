It presents earlier in women (menstrual disturbance) but later in men (eg with erectile dysfunction and/or mass eff ects). Prolactin stimulates lactation.11,12 Raised levels lead to hypo- gonadism, infertility, and osteoporosis, by inhibiting secretion of gonadotropin-re- leasing hormone (hence LH/FSH and testosterone or oestrogen). Causes of raised plasma prolactin (PRL; >390mU/L) PRL is secreted from the an- terior pituitary and release is inhibited by dopamine produced in the hypothala mus. Hyperprolactinaemia may result from 1 Excess production from the pituitary, eg prolactinoma. 2 Disinhibition, by compression of the pituitary stalk, reducing local dopamine levels. 3 Use of a dopamine antagonist. A PRL of 1000–5000mU/L may re- sult from any, but >5000 is likely to be due to a prolactinoma, with macroadenomas (>10mm) having the highest levels, eg 10 000–100 000. • Physiological: Pregnancy; breastfeeding; stress. Acute rises occur post-orgasm.11 • Drugs (most common cause): Metoclop ramide; haloperidol; methyldopa; oes- trogens; ecstasy/MDMA;12 antipsychotics (a reason for ‘non-compliance’: sustained hyperprolactinaemia may cause libido, anorgasmia, and erectile
