Seizures are common and focal; they can com- plicate diagnosis and post-ictal drowsiness may impair GCS assessment. Although ~80% will make a good functional recovery, death is mainly due to transtentorial herniation from mass eff ect or oedema.9 Dural venous sinus thrombosis Most commonly sagittal sinus thrombosis (fi gs 10.19, 10.20; 47% of all IVT) or transverse sinus thrombosis (35%). Sagittal sinus thrombosis often coexists if other sinuses are thrombosed. Symptom onset is gradu- al (over days or weeks). Features are dependent on the sinus aff ected: • Sagittal sinus: Heada che, vomiting, seizures, vision, papilloedema. • Transverse sinus: Headache ± mastoid pain, focal CNS signs, seizures, papilloedema. • Sigmoid sinus: Cerebellar signs, lower cranial nerve palsies. • Inferior petrosal sinus: Vth and VIth cranial nerve palsies, with temporal and retro-orbital pain (Gradenigo’s syndrome,. suggesting otitis media is the cause). • Cavernous sinus: Often due to spread from
