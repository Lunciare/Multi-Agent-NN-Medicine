longer act as inhibitors of pro- malignant processes. In most cases, mutations to both alleles must occur for a cancer phenotype. This can occur either as two separate somatic events, or in the case of predisposition genes, the fi rst ‘hit’ is inherited and the second oc- curs somatically. Tumours therefore occur earlier and more frequently in familial cancers. p53 is a tumour suppressor gene mutated in ~50% of human cancers. Most cancers arise from multiple mutations. This is perhaps best represented in the stepwise accumulation of mutations in colorectal cancer (fi g 11.2). An under- standing of the molecular biology of cancer facilitates drug development (fi g 11.3).
