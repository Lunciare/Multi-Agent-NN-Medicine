due to a GFR. This will be determined largely by the extent to which a drug is renally excreted. This is signifi cant for aminoglycosides, penicillins, cephalos porins, heparin, lithium, opiates, and digoxin. Loading doses should not be changed. If precision is required for dosing (eg chemotherapy) then GFR should not be estimated from creatinine: a cystatin C or direct measure of GFR should be used. If the patient is receiving renal replacement (haemofi ltration, peritoneal or hae- modialysis), dose modifi cation depends on the extent to which a drug is cleared from the circulation by dialysis/fi ltration. The best prescribing guide to consult is the Renal Drug Database/Handbook (www.renaldrugdatabase.com), an invaluable resource detailing dose modifi cation in renal failure and in renal replacement for almost any drug you could wish to use. All hospitals should have access: speak to your pharmacist. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 330055 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR 306 Re nal replacement therapy (RRT): dialysis and fi ltration Long-term dialysis is started when it is necessary to manage one or more symptoms of renal failure including: • inability to control volume status, including pulmonary oedema • inability to control blood pressure • serositis • acid–base or electrolyte abnormalities • pruritus
