careful monitoring is needed. • Growth retardation may occur in young patients, and the elderly frequently get more SE from treatment. • Interactions: effi cacy is reduced by anti-epileptics (see later in topic) and ri- fampicin. • Caution in pregnancy (may cause fetal growth retardation). See BNF for use in breastfeeding. Side effects: Multiple and serious (see table 8.11): minimize these by using the lowest dose possible for the shortest period of time. Prescribe calcium and vi- tamin D supplements to reduce risk of osteoporosis (p682) or consider bisphos- phonates. Before starting long-term treatment, explain clearly the potential SE to patients and ensure they are aware of the following: • Do not stop steroids suddenly (p836). • Consult a doctor if unwell;  steroid dose (eg if requiring antibiotics or surgery). • Carry a steroid card stating dose taken, and the indication. • Avoid over-the-counter drugs, eg NSAIDS: aspirin and ibuprofen (risk of DU). • Exercise and smoking cessation help to prevent osteoporosis. Azathioprine SE: Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, marrow suppression (anaemia, lym- phopenia), nephritis, pancreatitis, transaminitis. Interactions: Mercaptopurine and azathioprine (which is metabolized to mercaptopurine) are metabolized by xanthine oxidase (XO). So toxicity results if full dose azathioprine co-administered with
