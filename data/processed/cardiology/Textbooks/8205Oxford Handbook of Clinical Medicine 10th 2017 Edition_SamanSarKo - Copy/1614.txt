septic peritonitis and 2 progression of a systemic infl ammatory re- sponse syndrome (SIRS) to multi-organ failure, mediated by bacterial translocation across the dying gut wall. Resuscitation with fl uid, antibiotics (eg piperacillin/tazo- bactam, see table 9.3, p386), and, usually, LMWH/heparin are required. If arteriogra- phy is done, thrombolytics may be infused locally via the catheter. At surgery, dead bowel must be removed. Revascularization may be attempted on potentially viable bowel but it is a diffi cult process and often needs a 2nd laparotomy. Prognosis: Poor for arterial thrombosis and non-occlusive disease (<40% survive), though not so bad for venous and embolic ischaemia. 2 Chronic mesenteric ischaemia (AKA intestinal angina.) The triad of severe, colicky post-prandial abdominal pain (‘gut claudication’), weight (eating hurts), and an up- per abdominal bruit may be present ± PR bleeding, malabsoprtion, and N&V. Typically brought about through a combination of a low-fl ow state with atheroma (95% due to diff use atherosclerotic disease in all three mesenteric arteries). It is rare and diffi cult to diagnose. Tests: CT angiography and contrast-enhanced MR angiography are replac- ing traditional angiography. Treatment: Once diagnosis is confi rmed, surgery should be considered due to the ongoing risk of acute
