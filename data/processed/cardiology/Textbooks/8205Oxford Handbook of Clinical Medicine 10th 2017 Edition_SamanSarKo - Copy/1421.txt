osteoporosis; amyloidosis is rare (p370).17,18 Investigations Rheumatoid factor (RhF) is positive in ~70% (p553). High titres associated with severe disease, erosions, and extra-articular disease. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) are highly specifi c (~98%) for RA with a reasonable sensitivity (70–80%); they may also predict disease progression.19 Anaemia of chronic disease, platelets, ESR, CRP. X-rays show soft tissue swell- ing, juxta-articular osteopenia and joint space. Later there may be bony erosions, subluxation, or complete carpal destruction (see fi g 12.5 on p541). Ultrasound and MRI can identify synovitis more accurately, and have greater sensitivity in detecting bone erosions than conventional X-rays.20 Diagnostic criteria See table 12.4. Management Refer early to a rheumatologist (before irreversible destruction). • Disease activity is measured using the DAS28.3 Treatment should be escalated until satisfactory control is achieved: ‘treat to target’. • Early use of DMARDS and biological agents improves long-term outcomes (see BOX ‘Infl uencing biological events in RA’). • Steroids rapidly reduce symptoms and infl ammation. Avoid starting unless appro- priately experienced. Useful for acute exacerbations, eg IM depot methylpredniso- lone 80–120mg. Intra-articular steroids have a rapid but short-term eff ect (OHCS pp706–9). Oral steroids (eg prednisolone 7.5mg/d) may control diffi cult symptoms, but
