Avoid maintenance fl uids in those who normally have a fl uid restriction. Do not use a dialysis line or fi stula for IV access—if a cannula is necessary, preferentially use the back of the hand, save other vessels for future fi stulas. 5 Surgery needs senior anaesthetic and renal input. Aim for pre-op K+ <5.5mmol/L (<5.0mmol/L if major surgery with risk of tissue breakdown/ haemolysis). Check K+ urgently post-op (venous gas in recovery). In elective surgery, plan dialysis provision pre- and post-op. Warning: there is no normal Ten years is a long time. For those ten years, or just over 3,560 times, I attached myself to a peritoneal dialysis machine and underwent nine hours and fi fty min- utes of nightly therapy.
