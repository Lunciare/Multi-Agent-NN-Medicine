1.2g/d). Cholinergic SE: salivation, lacrimation, sweats, vom- iting, miosis. Other SE: diarrhoea, colic (controllable with propant he line 15mg/8h). • Immunosuppression: Treat relapses with prednisolone—start at 5mg on alter- nate days,  by 5mg/wk up to 1mg/kg on each treatment day. Dose on remis- sion (may take months). Give osteo porosis prophylaxis. SE: weakness (hence low starting dose). Azathioprine, ciclosporin, and mycophenolate mofetil may also be used. • Thymectomy: Has benefi cial eff ects, even in patients without a thymoma: consider especially in younger patients with onset <5yrs previously and poor re- sponse to medical therapy. A recent randomized controlled trial shows improved symptom scores sustained over 3yrs, with reduced need for immunosuppression. Surgery also prevents local invasion if thymoma is present. Myasthenic crisis Life-threatening weakness of respiratory muscles during a re- lapse. Can be diffi cult to diff erentiate from cholinergic crisis (ie overtreatment— but this is rare, and usually only occurs in doses of pyridostigmine >960mg/d). Monitor forced vital capacity. Ventilatory support may be needed. Treat with plasmapheresis (removes AChR antibodies from the circulation) or IVIg and identify and treat the trigger for the relapse (eg infection, medications). Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) LEMS can be paraneoplastic (50% are
