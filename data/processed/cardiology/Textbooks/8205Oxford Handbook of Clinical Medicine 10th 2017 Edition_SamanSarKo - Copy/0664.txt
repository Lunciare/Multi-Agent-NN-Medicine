constipation (eg IBS, p266)? Has there been recent change in bowel habit? Is she digitating the rectum or vagina to pass stool?15 Ask about diet and drugs. PR examination is essential even when referring (refer if signs of colorectal ca, eg weight, pain, or anaemia). Tests None in young, mildly aff ected patients. Threshold for investigation di- minishes with age; triggers include:6 weight, abdominal mass, +PR blood, iron defi ciency anaemia. Blood: FBC, ESR, U&E, Ca2+, TFT. Colonoscopy: If suspected colo- rectal malignancy. Transit studies; anorectal physiology; biopsy for Hirschprung’s are occasionally needed. Treatment Often reassurance, drinking more, and diet/exercise advice (p245) is all that is needed. Treat causes (BOX ‘Causes of constipation’). A high-fi bre diet is often advised, but may cause bloating without helping constipation. Only use drugs if these measures fail, and try to use them for short periods only. Often, a stimulant such as senna ± a bulking agent is more eff ective and cheaper than agents such as lactulose. Bulking agents: Faecal mass, so stimulating peristal- sis. They must be taken with plenty of fl uid and may take a few days to act. CI: diffi culty in swallowing; GI obstruction; colonic atony; faecal impaction.
