This is the hardest but the most rewarding task, and may save some ears. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 445599 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 460 Blackouts Causes of collapse ± loss of consciousness (LOC) are many; take a careful history (BOX). Vasovagal (neurocardiogenic) syncope Occurs due to refl ex bradycardia ± pe- ripheral vasodilation provoked by emotion, pain, or standing too long (it cannot occur when lying down). Onset is over seconds (not instantaneous), and is often pre- ceded by pre-syncopal symptoms, eg nausea, pallor, sweating, and narrowing of vis- ual fi elds. Brief clonic jerking of the limbs may occur due to cerebral hypoperfusion, but there is no tonic/clonic sequence. Urinary incontinence is uncommon, and there is no tongue-biting. Unconsciousness usually lasts for ~2min and recovery is rapid. Situation syncope Symptoms as for vasovagal syncope but with a clear precipi- tant: cough syncope occurs after a paroxysm of coughing; effort syncope is brought on by exercise; there is usually a cardiac cause, eg aortic stenosis, HCM; micturition syncope happens during or after urination: mostly men, at night. Carotid sinus syncope Hypersensitive baroreceptors cause excessive refl ex brady- cardia ± vasodilation on minimal stimulation
