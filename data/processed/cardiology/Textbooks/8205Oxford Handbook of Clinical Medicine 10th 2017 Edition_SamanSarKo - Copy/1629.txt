crystalloid as replacement and maintenance IVI. Blood transfu- sion only if signifi cant blood loss (table 13.10, p607).  Clotting: Withold ± reverse anticoagulation and antiplatelet agents (p351).  Antibiotics may occasionally be required if there is evidence of sepsis or perfo- ration, eg piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h IV.  Keep bedbound: The patient may feel the need to get out of bed to pass stool, but this could be another large bleed, resulting in collapse if they try to walk. Don’t allow them to mobilize and inform the nursing staff of this.  Start a stool chart to monitor volume and frequency of motions. Send a sample for MC&S (x3 if known to have compromising comorbidity such as IBD).  Diet: Keep on clear fl uids so that they can have something, yet the colon will be as clear as possible if colonoscopy required.  Interventions if bleeding not settling with conservative management: Angi- ography may allow localization of bleeding (eg sigmoid diverticulum or right sided angiodysplasia) as well as therapeutic embolization; CT angiography is a non-invasive alternative (without interventional options); colonoscopy may permit endoscopic haemostasis.  Surgery: The main indication for this is unremitting, massive bleeding that is not controlled
