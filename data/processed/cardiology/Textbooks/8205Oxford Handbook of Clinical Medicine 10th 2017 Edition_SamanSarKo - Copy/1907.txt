Can be used to assess: Kidneys: • Renal size—small in chronic kidney disease, large in renal masses, cysts, hypertro- phy if other kidney missing, polycystic kidney disease (fi g 16.35), and rarities (eg amyloidosis, p370). • Hydronephrosis, which may indicate ureteric obstruction or refl ux (fi g 13.49, p641). • Perinephric collections (trauma, post-biopsy). • Renal perfusion (assessment of renovascular disease: Doppler US of renal arteries). • Transplanted kidneys (collections, obstruction, perfusion). Lower urinary tract: • Bladder volume: useful in assessment of the need to catheterize (see p640) or for assessment of adequacy of bladder emptying (post-micturition residual volume). • Prostate: transrectal ultrasound enables US-guided biopsy of focal lesions. NB: pros- tate size does not correlate with symptoms. Other: • Ovarian cysts, size, infections (pyosalpinx), uterine fi broids and other masses. • Testicular masses, hydrocele, varicocele. Advantages: Fast; cheap; independent of renal function; no IV contrast or radiation risk. Disadvantages: Intraluminal
