The ‘pallor’ refers to the vasculature on the inner surface of the lid which is lacking Hb. It is this colour but it should be: Red cell distribution width (RCDW or RDW) In health or in unifactorial anaemia, all the red cells in a sample are about the same size, and the graph of their volume distribution forms a narrow peak. In mixed anaemias, however, this peak broadens, refl ecting an abnormally large RDW—this may be the fi rst clue to dual pathology. In coeliac disease, for example, poor ab- sorption of iron (MCV) and folate (MCV) may occur simultaneously, resulting in a combination of microcytes and macrocytes in the circulation. The visual analogue of this is anisocytosis (p328) on a blood fi lm. The laboratory measure is a RDW, where RDW = the standard deviation of MCV divided by the mean MCV, multiplied by 100. Reference interval: 11 . 5–14 . 6%. If the MCV is high and the RDW is normal, the cause is likely to be alcohol,
