non-cir- rhotic (and liver histology can improve). Arthropathy may improve or worsen. Gonadal failure may reverse in younger men. If cirrhosis, 22–30% get hepatocellular cancer, especially if: age >50yrs (risk  ≈ 13), HBsAg +ve (risk  ≈ 5), or alcohol abuse (risk  ≈ 2). 39 Transferrin saturation >45% is a sensitive threshold for further screening but will lead to some false +ves. 40 Although generally not required, biopsy quantifi es hepatic iron loading and fi brosis. This helps deter- mine the severity of liver disease, particularly in those with other underlying causes of chronic liver disease. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 228888 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG A bit about iron metabolism 289 60% of body iron is in haemoglobin, and erythropoiesis requires ~5–30mg iron/ day—provided by macrophages (recycling of haeme iron after phagocytosis of old RBCs). Intestinal iron absorption (1–2mg/day) compensates for daily iron losses. Red meats, liver, seafoods, enriched breakfast cereals and pulses, and some spices (eg paprika) are iron-rich. Most dietary iron is Fe3+, which is reduced by low gastric pH and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) to better-absorbed Fe2+. Absorption occurs mainly in the duodenum and jejunum, though very small amounts are ab- sorbed in the stomach and ileum. Iron requirements
