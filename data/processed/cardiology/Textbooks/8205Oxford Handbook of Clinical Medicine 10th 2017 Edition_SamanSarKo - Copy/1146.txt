haze due to infl ammatory response. Multiple/bilateral/extensive lesions if  immunosuppression. Serology. Ocular fl uid PCR. Treatment: atovaquone (toxicity), sulfadiazine, and pyrimethamine. Filarial infection Onchocerciasis (‘river blindness’) Caused by fi larial worm, Onchocerca volvulus. Transmitted by the bite of infected black fl ies which breed in fast-fl owing rivers and streams. Second most com- mon infectious cause of blindness worldwide: predominantly sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil, Venezuela, Yemen. Presentation: A nodule forms at the site of the bite where larvae mature to adult worms. The female adult can release up to 1000 microfi lariae/day causing: • skin disease: altered pigmenta tion, lichenifi cation, loss of elasticity, poor healing • eye disease: keratitis, uveitis, cataract, fi xed pupil, fundal degeneration, optic neuritis/atrophy, visual impairment/loss (fi g 9.51) • impaired lymphatic function: lymphadenopathy, elephantiasis. Diagnosis: Visualization of microfi laria in eye or on skin snip biopsy: a fi ne shav- ing of clean skin is incubated in 0.9% saline to allow microfi lariae to emerge for microscopic identifi cation. Serology. Treatment: Ivermectin 150mcg/kg, one dose every 3–12 months (depending on likely re-exposure). CI if coexisting Loa-Loa due to risk of fatal encephalitic reaction. Or 6wk doxycycline. No vaccine available. Fig 9.51 Bilateral sclerosing Fig
