personal identity, and acromegaly We might have devoted this box to a grotesque homunculus depicting the signs of acromegaly: all disconnected lips, hands, feet, brows, and noses. But our integra- tive ethics disallow this, and ask us instead to see if acromegaly can reveal some- thing universal about our patients and ourselves. What is it like to feel in the grip of some ‘alien puberty’ or ‘empty pregnancy’? These analogies are physiological as well as metaphorical.14,15 The changes of acromegaly are not so insidious that the patient thinks all is fi ne: there is often partial knowledge and a few dark thoughts on looking into the mirror. Even when we lay our lives end-to-end for inspection (fi g 5.28), changes are subtle. It can take the observations of others to force us to come face-to-face with the truth of our new unfolding self. In one patient the comment was ‘So are you pregnant again?’ ‘Why do you ask?’ ‘Because your nose is as big as it was when you were last pregnant’. So here we have the well-known ‘physiological acromegaly of pregnancy’14 predating the pathological, as the carni- val of personal identity moves from helter-skelter to roller-coaster. 14 GH variants
