g 3.47); Osler’s nodes (painful pulp in- farcts in fi ngers or toes). Embolic phenomena: Emboli may cause abscesses in the relevant organ, eg brain, heart, kidney, spleen, gut (or lung if right-sided IE) or skin: termed Janeway lesions (fi g 3.48; painless palmar or plantar macules), which, to- gether with Osler’s nodes, are pathognomonic. Diagnosis Use the Modifi ed Duke criteria (BOX ‘Modified Duke criteria’).62, 63 Blood cultures: Do three sets at diff erent times from diff erent sites at peak of fever. 85– 90% are diagnosed from the 1st two sets; 10% are culture-negative. Blood tests: Normochromic, normocytic anaemia, neutrophilia, high ESR/CRP. Rheumatoid factor positive (an immunological phenomenon). Also check U&E, Mg2+, LFT. Urinalysis: For microscopic haematuria. CXR: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary oedema. Regular ECGs: To look for heart block. Echocardiogram: TTE (p110) may show vegetations, but only if >2mm. TOE (p110) is more sensitive, and better for visualizing mitral lesions and pos- sible development of aortic root abscess. CT: To look for emboli (spleen, brain, etc.). Treatment Liaise early with microbiologists and cardiologists.62 Antibiotics: see BOX ‘Antibiotic therapy for infective endocarditis’. Surgery if: Heart failure, valvular ob- struction; repeated emboli; fungal IE; persistent bacteraemia; myocardial abscess; unstable infected prosthetic
