may be all that are required for diagnosis. Polysomnography (which monitors oxygen saturation, airfl ow at the nose and mouth, ECG, EMG chest, and abdominal wall movement during sleep) is diagnostic. The occurrence of 15 or more episodes of apnoea or hypopnoea during 1h of sleep, on average, indicates signifi cant sleep apnoea. Management • Weight reduction. • Avoidance of tobacco and alcohol. • Mandibular advancement device. • CPAP via a nasal mask during sleep is eff ective and recommended by NICE for those with moderate to severe disease. 52 • Surgery to relieve pharyngeal or nasal obstruction, eg tonsillectomy or polypectomy, is occasionally needed. Cor pulmonale Cor pulmonale is right heart failure caused by chronic pulmonary arterial hyperten- sion. Causes include chronic lung disease, pulmonary vascular disorders, and neuro- muscular and skeletal diseases (see BOX). Clinical features Symptoms include dyspnoea, fatigue, and syncope. Signs: cya- nosis; tachycardia; raised JVP with prominent a and v waves; RV heave; loud P2, pan- systolic murmur (tricuspid regurgitation); early diastolic Graham Steell murmur; hepatomegaly and oedema. Investigations FBC: Hb and haematocrit  (secondary polycythaemia). ABG: hypoxia, with or without hypercapnia. CXR: enlarged right atrium and ventricle, prominent pulmonary arteries (see fi g 4.17).
