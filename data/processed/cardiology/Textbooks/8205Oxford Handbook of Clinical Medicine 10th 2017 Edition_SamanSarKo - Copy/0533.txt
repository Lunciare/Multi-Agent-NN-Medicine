• Rubeosis iridis: New vessels on iris: occurs late and may lead to glaucoma. • Metabolic complications: p832. • Diabetic feet: p212. • Neuropathy: p212. 2 As DM has so many vascular events, particularly encourage statin use (p690), esp. if LDL >3mmol/L or systolic BP >140. Even consider a statin whatever the pre-treatment cholesterol; discuss with your patient. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 221100 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE Controlling blood pressure in diabetes 211 Type 1 DM: Treat BP if >135/85mmHg, unless albuminuria or two or more features of metabolic syndrome, in which case it should be 130/80mmHg (NICE 2015). Use an ACE-i 1st line or angiotension receptor antagonist if intolerant. If hypertensive and underlying renal involvement, see local guidance, p304. Type 2 DM: Target BP <140/80mmHg or <130/80mmHg if kidney, eye, or cerebrovas- cular damage. 1st-line drug treatment should be an ACE-i, except in those of Afri- can or Caribbean origin, where ACE-i plus diuretic or a calcium-channel antagonist (CCA) should be started. For pregnant women off er CCA. Do not off er aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease to adults with type 1 DM (NICE 2015). Don’t combine an ACE-i with an angiotension receptor antagonist. Fig 5.6 Background retinopathy, with micro-
