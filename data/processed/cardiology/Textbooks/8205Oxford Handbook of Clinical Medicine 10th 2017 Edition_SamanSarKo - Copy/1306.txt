nerve against its bony confi nes (the medial condyle of the humerus—the ‘funny bone’). Normally, stretch and compression forces on the ulnar nerve at the elbow are moderated by its ability to glide in its groove. When normal excursion is restricted, irritation ensues. This may cause a vicious cycle of perineural scarring, consequent loss of excursion, and progressive symptoms—without antecedent trauma. Compressive ulnar neuropathies at the wrist (Guyon’s canal—between the pisiform and hamate bones) are less common, but they can also result in disability. Treatment centres on rest and avoiding pressure on the nerve, but if symp- toms conti nue, night-time soft elbow splinting (to prevent fl exion >60°) is warranted. A splint for the hand may help prevent permanent clawing of the fi ngers. For chronic neuropathy associated with weakness, or if splint- ing fails, a variety of surgical procedures have been tried. For moderately se- vere neuropathies, decompressions in situ may help, but often fail. Medial epicondylectomies are eff ective in 50% (but many will recur). Subcutaneous nerve re-routing (transposition) may be tried. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 550033 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 504 Polyneuropathies Motor and/or sensory disorder of multiple periphe ral or cranial nerves: usually sym- metrical, widespread, and often worse
