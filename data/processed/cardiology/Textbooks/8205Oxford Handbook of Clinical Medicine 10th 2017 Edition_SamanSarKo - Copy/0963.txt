less aff ected by anaemia and simpler to automate. PV is aff ected by the concentration of large plasma proteins and  in the same conditions as the ESR—both PV and ESR  in chronic infl ammation and are less aff ected by acute changes (unlike CRP, p686). Hyperviscosity syndrome Symptoms Lethargy; confusion; cognition; CNS disturbance; chest pain; abdomi nal pain (and sometimes spontaneous GI or GU bleeding); faints; visual disturbance (eg vision, amaurosis fugax, retinopathy—eg engorged retinal veins, haemorrhages, exudates; and a blurred disc as seen in fi g 8.76). The visual symptoms are like ‘looking through a watery car windscreen’. Causes of high blood viscosity Very high red cell count (haematocrit >50, eg polycythaemia vera), white cell count (>100≈109/L, eg leukaemia), or plasma compo- nents—usually immunoglobulins, in myeloma or Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (p370, as IgM is larger and so  viscosity more than the same amount of IgG). Drugs: oral contraceptives, diuretics, IV IG, erythropoietin, chemotherapy, radio-contrast media. Treatment Urgent treatment is needed which depends on the cause. Venesec- tion is done in polycythaemia. Leukapheresis in leukaemias to remove white cells. Plasmapheresis in myeloma and Waldenström’s: blood is withdrawn via a plasma exchange machine, the supernatant plasma from this
