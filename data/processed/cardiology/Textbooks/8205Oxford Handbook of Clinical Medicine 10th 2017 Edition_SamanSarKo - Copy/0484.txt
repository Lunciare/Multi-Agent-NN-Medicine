drive: Sedative drugs, CNS tumour or trauma. • Neuromuscular disease: Cervical cord lesion, diaphragmatic paralysis, poliomyeli- tis, myasthenia gravis, Guillain–Barré syndrome. • Thoracic wall disease: Flail chest, kyphoscoliosis. Clinical features are those of the underlying cause together with symptoms and signs of hypoxia, with or without hypercapnia. Hypoxia: Dyspnoea; restlessness; agitation; confusion; central cyanosis. If long- standing hypoxia: polycythaemia; pulmonary hypertension; cor pulmonale. Hypercapnia: Headache; peripheral vasodilation; tachycardia; bounding pulse; tremor/fl ap; papilloedema; confusion; drowsiness; coma. Investigations are aimed at determining the underlying cause: • Blood tests: FBC, U&E, CRP, ABG. See table 4.7. • Radiology: CXR. • Microbiology: sputum and blood cultures (if febrile). • Spirometry (COPD, neuromuscular disease, Guillain–Barré syndrome). Management Depends on the cause: Type I respiratory failure: • Treat underlying cause. • Give oxygen (24–60%) by facemask. • Assisted ventilation if PaO2 <8kPa despite 60% O2. Type II respiratory failure: The respiratory centre may be relatively insensitive to CO2 and respiration could be driven by hypoxia. • Treat underlying cause. • Controlled oxygen therapy: start at 24% O2. Oxygen therapy should be given with care. Nevertheless, don’t leave the hypoxia untreated. • Recheck ABG after 20min. If PaCO2 is steady or lower, increase O2 con centration
