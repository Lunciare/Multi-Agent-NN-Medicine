It results from inhalation of coal dust par- ticles (1–3μm in diameter) over 15–20yrs. These are ingested by macrophages which die, releasing their enzymes and causing fi brosis. Clinical features: Asymptomatic, but coexisting chronic bronchitis is common. CXR: many round opacities (1–10mm), especially in upper zone. Management: Avoid exposure to coal dust; treat co-existing chronic bronchitis; claim compensation (in the UK, via the Industrial Injuries Act). Progressive massive fi brosis (PMF) Due to progression of CWP, which causes pro- gressive dyspnoea, fi brosis, and, eventually, cor pulmonale. CXR: usually bilateral, upper-mid zone fi brotic masses (1–10cm), develop from periphery towards hilum. Management: Avoid exposure to coal dust; claim compensation (as for CWP). Caplan’s syndrome The association between rheumatoid arthritis, pneumoc oniosis, and pulmonary rheumatoid nodules. Silicosis (See fi g 4.21.) Caused by inhalation of silica particles, which are very fi bro- genic. A number of jobs may be associated with exposure, eg metal mining, stone quarrying, sandblasting, and pottery/ceramic manufacture. Clinical features: Progressive dyspnoea, incidence of TB, CXR shows diff use miliary
