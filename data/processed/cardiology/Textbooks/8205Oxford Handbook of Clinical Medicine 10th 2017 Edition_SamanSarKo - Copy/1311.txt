3 : 2), char- acterized by selective loss of neurons in motor cortex, cranial nerve nuclei, and an- terior horn cells. Upper and lower motor neurons can be aff ected but there is no sensory loss or sphincter disturbance, thus distinguishing MND from MS and poly- neuropathies. MND never aff ects eye movements, distinguishing it from myasthenia (p512). There are four clinical patterns: 1 ALS/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. (Archetypal MND; up to 80%.) Loss of motor neurons in motor cortex and the anterior horn of the cord, so combined UMN + LMN signs (p446). Worse prognosis if: bulbar onset, age; FVC. 2 Progressive bulbar palsy. (10–20%.) Only aff ects cranial nerves IX–XII. See BOX ‘Bulbar and corticobulbar (‘pseudobulbar’) palsy’. 3 Progressive muscular atrophy. (<10%.) Anterior horn cell lesion, so LMN signs only. Aff ects distal muscle groups before proximal. Better prognosis than ALS. 4 Primary lateral sclerosis. (Rare.) Loss of Betz cells in motor cortex: mainly UMN signs, marked spastic leg weakness and pseudobulbar palsy. No cognitive decline. Presentation Think of MND in those >40yrs (median UK age at onset is 60) with stum- bling spastic gait, foot-drop ± proximal myopathy, weak grip (door-handles don’t turn) and shoulder abduction (hair-washing is
