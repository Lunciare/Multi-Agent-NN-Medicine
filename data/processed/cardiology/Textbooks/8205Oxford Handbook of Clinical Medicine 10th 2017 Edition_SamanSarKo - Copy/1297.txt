and turning-out of the lower lid), injury from foreign bodies, or conjunctivitis. Other causes of VIIth palsy Account for ~30% of facial palsies. Think of these if: rashes, bilateral symptoms, UMN signs, other cranial nerve involvement, or limb weakness. Infective: Ramsay Hunt syndrome (BOX), Lyme disease, meningitis, TB, viruses (HIV, polio). Brainstem lesions: Stroke, tumour, MS. Cerebellopontine angle tumours: Acoustic neuroma, meningioma. Systemic disease: DM, sarcoidosis, Guil- lain–Barré. Local disease: Orofacial granulomatosis, parotid tumours, otitis media or cholesteatoma, skull base trauma. Lyme disease, Guillain–Barré, sarcoid, and trauma often cause bilateral weakness. Tests Rule out the other causes: Blood: ESR; glucose;  Borrelia antibodies in Lyme disease,  VZV antibodies in Ramsay Hunt syndrome (BOX). CT/MRI: Space-occupying lesions; stroke; MS; CSF: (Rarely done) for infections. Prognosis Incomplete paralysis without axonal degen eration usually recovers completely within a few weeks. Of those with complete paralysis ~80% make a full spontaneous recovery, but ~15% have axonal degeneration (~50% in pregnancy) in which case recovery is delayed, starting after ~3 months, and may be compl icated by aberrant reconnect ions: synkinesis, eg eye blinking causes synchronous upturn- ing of the mouth; misconnection of parasympathetic fi bres (red in fi g 10.26) can produce crocodile
