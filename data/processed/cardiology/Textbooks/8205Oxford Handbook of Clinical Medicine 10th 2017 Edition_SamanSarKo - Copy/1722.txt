history of bleeding. This pa- tient may need urgent transfusion (no spare capacity)—ask about symptoms, co-morbidities, and baseline Hb. Check haematinics before transfusion. See p324. • Platelets <40≈109/L. May need a platelet transfusion; call a haematologist. • Plasmodium falciparum seen on blood fi lm. Start antimalarials now. See p418. • ESR >30mm/h + headache. Could there be giant cell arteritis? See p556. CSF results:  Never delay treatment when bacterial meningitis is suspected. • >1 neutrophil/mm3. Is there meningitis: usually >1000 neutrophils? See p822. • Positive Gram stain. Talk to a microbiologist; urgent blind therapy. See p822.

Normal daily losses are through urine (1500mL), stool (200mL), and insensible losses (800mL). This requirement is normally met through food (1000mL) and drink (1500mL). Intravenous fl uids Given if suffi cient fl uids cannot be given orally. About 2–2.5L of fl uid containing roughly 70mmol Na+ and 70mmol K+ per 24h are required.1 Thus, a good regimen is 2–2.5L of 0.18% glucose with sodium chloride with 20–30mmol of K+
