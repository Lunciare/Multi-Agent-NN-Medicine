management—NBM and antibiotics. If the mass resolves, some perform an interval (ie delayed) appendicectomy. Exclude a colonic tumour (lapa- rotomy or colonoscopy), which can present as early as the 4th decade. • Appendix abscess May result if an appendix mass fails to resolve but enlarges and the patient gets more unwell. Treatment usually involves drainage (surgical or percutaneous under US/CT-guidance). Antibiotics alone may bring resolution. 8 There is a second peak between 60–70yrs; older adults may present later with atypical symptoms. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 660088 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Explaining the patterns of abdominal pain 609 Internal organs and the visceral peritoneum have no somatic innervation, so the brain attributes the visceral (splanchnic) signals to a physical location whose der- matome corresponds to the same entry level in the spinal cord. Importantly, there is no laterality to the visceral unmyelinated C-fi bre pain signals, which enter the cord bilaterally and at multiple levels. Division of the gut according to embryologi- cal origin is the important determinant here: see table 13.11.
