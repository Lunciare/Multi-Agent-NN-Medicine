It may be 1° (age-related) or 2° to another condition or drugs. If trabecular bone is aff ected, crush fractures of vertebrae are common (hence the ‘littleness’ of little old ladies and their dowager’s hump); if cortical bone is aff ected, long bone fractures are more likely, eg femoral neck: the big cause of death and orthopaedic expense (80% hip fractures in the UK occur in women >50yrs). Prevalence (In those >50yrs):  6%,  18%. Women lose trabeculae with age, but in men, although there is reduced bone formation, numbers of trabeculae are stable and their lifetime risk of fracture is less. Risk factors Age-independent risk factors for 1° osteoporosis: parental history, alcohol >4 units daily, rheumatoid arthritis, BMI <19, prolonged immobility, and un- treated menopause. See BOX ‘Osteoporosis risk factors’ for other risk factors, includ- ing for 2° osteoporosis. Investigations X-ray (low sensitivity/specifi city, often with hindsight after a fracture). Bone densitometry (DEXA—see BOX ‘DEXA bone densitometry’; table 14.5). Bloods: Ca2+, PO43Ω, and
