Atrial fl utter: Electrical activity circles the atria 300 times per minute, giving a ‘sawtooth’ baseline, see fi g 3.35. The AVN passes some of these impulses on, result- ing in ventricular rates that are factors of 300 (150, 100, 75). D. Atrioventricular re-entry tachycardia: (AVRT) An accessory pathway (eg in Wolff -Parkinson-White (WPW), p133) allows electrical activity from the ventricles to pass to the resting atrial myocytes, creating a circuit: atria–AVN–ventricles– accessory pathway–atria. This direction is called ‘orthodromic’ conduction and results in narrow QRS complexes as ventricular depolarization is triggered via the bundles of His. Conduction in the other direction is called ‘antidromic’ and results in broad QRS complexes. E. Atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia: (AVNRT) Circuits form within the AVN, causing narrow complex tachycardias. This is very
