the face of needs. Failure occurs when cardiac output fails to meet these needs. It will occur with a normal heart, but even earlier if there is heart disease. Causes: anaemia, pregnancy, hyperthyroidism, Paget’s disease, arteriovenous malformation, beriberi. Consequences: initially features of RVF; later LVF becomes evident. Diagnosis Requires symptoms of failure (see above) and objective evidence of car- diac dysfunction at rest. For CCF, use the Framingham criteria. 35 Signs As described previously plus cyanosis, BP, narrow pulse pressure, pulsus al- ternans, displaced apex (LV dilatation), RV heave (pulmonary hypertension), signs of valve diseases. Severity can be graded using the New York classifi cation (see BOX). Investigations According to NICE, 33 if ECG and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP; p137) are normal, heart failure is unlikely, and an alternative diagnosis should be consid- ered; if either is abnormal, then echocardiography (p110) is required. Tests FBC; U&E; BNP; CXR (see fi g 3.38); ECG; echo. ECG may indicate cause (look for evidence of ischaemia, MI, or ventricular hypertrophy). It is rare to get a completely normal ECG in chronic heart failure. Echocardiography is the key investigation. 36 It may indicate the cause (MI, valvular heart disease) and can confi rm the
