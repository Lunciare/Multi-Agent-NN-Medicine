involvement of two or more peripheral nerves. Causes tend to be systemic: DM, connective tissue disorders (rheumatoid, SLE), vasculitis (granulomatosis with polyangiitis formerly Wegener’s granuloma- tosis, PAN), and more rarely sarcoidosis, amy loid, leprosy. Electrom yography (EMG) helps defi ne the anatomic site of lesions. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 550022 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN Carpal tunnel syndrome: the commonest mononeuropathy 503 The median nerve and nine tendons compete for space within the wrist. Compres- sion is common, especially in women who have narrower wrists but similar-sized tendons to men. Clinical features: Aching pain in the hand and arm (especially at night), and par- aesthesiae in thumb, index, and middle fi ngers: relieved by dangling the hand over the edge of the bed and shaking it (remember ‘wake and shake’). There may be sensory loss and weakness of abductor pollicis brevis ± wasting of the thenar emi- nence. Light touch, 2-point discrimination, and sweating may be impaired. Causes: Anything causing swelling or compression of the tunnel: myxoedema; prolonged fl exion (eg in a Colles’ splint); acromegaly; myeloma; local tumours (lipomas, ganglia); rheumatoid arthritis; amyloidosis; pregnancy; sarcoidosis. Tests: Neurophysiology helps by confi rming the lesion’s site and severity (and like- lihood of improvement after surgery). Maximal
