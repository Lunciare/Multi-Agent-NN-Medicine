Assessment: Do PR (overfl ow incontinence? poor tone?) and assess neurological function of legs, particularly checking sensation. Refer to a specialist (esp. if rectal prolapse, anal sphincter injury, lumbar disc disease, or alarm symptoms for colon ca exist). Consider anorectal manometry, pelvic ultra- sound or MRI, and pudendal nerve testing may be needed.

Plan trips in the knowledge of toilet locations. • Obey call-to-stool impulses (esp. after meal, ie the gastro-colic refl ex). • Ensure access to latest continence aids and advice on use, refer to continence nurse specialist for assessment. • Pelvic
