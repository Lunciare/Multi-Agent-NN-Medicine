The time from injection via a central vein to detection via an arterial line, plus dilution, gives estimates of cardiac output and volume status and can guide fl uid and inotrope therapy. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 880022 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE  Management of cardiogenic shock 803 Oxygen Titrate to maintain arterial saturations of 94–98% (88–92% if COPD) Diamorphine 1.25–5mg IV for pain and anxiety Investigations and close monitoring (see p802) Correct arrhythmias (pp124–31), U&E abnormalities, or acid–base disturbance Optimize fi lling pressure with clinical assessment of pulse, BP, JVP/ CVP (if in ICU consider using PICCO, LIDCO, transoesophageal doppler or Swan–Gantz catheter to estimate cardiac output and fl uid balance) Underfi lled?
