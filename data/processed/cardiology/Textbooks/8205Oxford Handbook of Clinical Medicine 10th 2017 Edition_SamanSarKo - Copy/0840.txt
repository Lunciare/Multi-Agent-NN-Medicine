kidney disease 1 in 20 000, chromosome 6. Presents ante/perinatally with renal cysts (‘salt and pep- per’ appearance on USS), congenital hepatic fi brosisportal hypertension. Poor prog- nosis if neonatal respiratory distress. No specifi c therapy. (See OHCS p132.) Renal phakomatoses Tuberous sclerosis complex: 1 in 6000, autosomal dominant. Two genes: TSC1 (chro- mosome 9) and TSC2 (chromosome 16). Multisystem disorder with hamartoma for- mation in skin, brain (epilepsy), eye, heart, and lung (see OHCS p638). In kidney: angiomyolipomata in 90% with risk of aneurysm and haemorrhage, cystic disease in 50%. Replacement of renal tissue leads to kidney failure. mTORC1 inhibitors (eg sirolimus, everolimus) block pathological cell signalling and reduce tumour volume. Von Hippel–Lindau syndrome: 1 in 36 000, autosomal dominant (p712). Mutation in VHL gene (chromosome 3) leads to uncontrolled activation of growth factors. Pheno- type is a familial, multisystem cancer syndrome including renal cysts and clear cell renal carcinoma at mean age 40s, ~70% risk by age 60 (VHL tumour-suppressor gene is inactiva ted in most sporadic renal cell cancers). Manage by screening for tumours. Possibility of future therapies which inhibit growth factor signalling. Alport syndrome 1 in 5000. ~80–85% X-linked. Due to mutations in the COL4A5 gene,
