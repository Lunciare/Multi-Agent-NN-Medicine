There is also anosognosia—a lack of insight into the problems engendered by the disease, eg missed appointments, misunderstood conversations or plots of fi lms, and mishandling of money. Later there may be irritability; mood dis- turbance (depression or euphoria); behavioural change (eg aggression, wandering, disinhibition); psychosis (hallucinations or delusions); agnosia (may not recognize self in the mirror). There is no standard natural history. Cognitive impairment is progressive, but non-cognitive symptoms may come and go over months. Eventually many patients become sedentary, taking little interest in anything. Cause Environmental and genetic factors both play a role. Accumulation of -amyloid peptide, a degradation product of amyloid precursor protein, results in progressive neuronal damage, neurofi br illary tangles, numbers of amyloid plaques, and loss of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (fi g 10.24). Neuronal loss is selective— the hippocampus, amygdala, temporal neocortex, and subcortical nuclei are most vulnerable. Vascular eff ects are also important—95% of AD patients show evidence of vascular dementia. Risk factors 1st-degree relative with AD; Down’s syndrome (in which AD is in- evitable, often <40yrs); homozygosity for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) E4 allele (see BOX ‘Genetics and
