Look for microangiopathic anaemia, eg DIC (p352), haemolytic urae- mic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP: p315), or pre-eclampsia. Spherocytes: Spherical cells found in hereditary spherocytosis and autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. See p338. Target cells: (Also known as Mexican hat cells, fi g 8.14 and fi g 8.41, p343.) These are RBCS with central staining, a ring of pallor, and an outer rim of staining seen in liver disease, hyposplenism, thalassaemia—and, in small numbers, in IDA. Tear-drop RBCS: Seen in extramedullary haematopoiesis; see leukoerythroblastic fi lm. 3 Cabot ‘fi gure-of-eight’ rings may be micro tubules from mitotic spindles. It is easy to confuse them with malaria parasites, p416 (especially if stippling gives a ‘chromatin dot’ artefact, as here). Richard Clarke Cabot (1868–1939) liked diagnostic challenges: he founded the notoriously hard but beautifully presented weekly clinicopathological exercises of the Massachusetts General Hospital which made the New England Journal of Medicine so famous. He also wisely recommended that: ‘before you tell the truth to the patient, be sure you know the truth, and that the patient wants to hear it’. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 332288 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 329 Fig 8.10 Acanthocytosis.
