Homozygotes (SS) have sickle-cell anaemia (HbSS), and heteroz ygotes (HbAS) have sickle-cell trait, which causes no disability (and protects from falciparum malaria). Heterozygotes may still, however, experi- ence symptomatic sickling in hypoxia, eg in unpressurized aircraft or anaesthesia (so all those of African descent need a pre-op sickle-cell test). Pathogenesis HbS polymerizes when deoxygenated, causing RBCS to deform, pro- ducing sickle cells, which are fragile and haemolyse, and also block small vessels. Prevalence 1:700 people of African descent. Tests Haemolysis is variable. Hb ≈ 60–90g/L, reticulocytes 10–20%, bilirubin. Film: sickle cells and target cells (fi g 8.37). Sickle solubility test: +ve, but does not distinguish between HbSS and HbAS. Hb electrophoresis: Confi rms the diagnosis and distinguishes SS, AS states, and other Hb variants. Aim for diagnosis at birth (cord blood) to aid prompt pneumococcal prophylaxis (vaccine, p167 ± penicillin V). Signs/symptoms Chronic haemolysis is usually well tolerated (except in crises; see BOX ‘Managing sickle-cell crises’). Vaso-occlusive ‘painful’ crisis: Common, due to microvascular occlusion. Often af- fects the marrow, causing severe pain, triggered by cold, dehydration, infection, or hypoxia. Hands and feet are aff ected if <3yrs old leading to dactylitis. Occlusion may cause mesenteric ischaemia, mimicking an acute abdomen.
