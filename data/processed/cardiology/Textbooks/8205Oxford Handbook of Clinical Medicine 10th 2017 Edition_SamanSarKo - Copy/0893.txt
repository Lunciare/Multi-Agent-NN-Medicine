We have to recog- nize that two people with the identical mutation at their  loci may have quite dif- ferent diseases. Co-inheritance of other genes and conditions (eg  thalassaemia) is part of the explanation, as is the effi ciency of production of fetal haemoglobin. The reasons lie beyond simple co-segregation of genes promoting the formation of fetal Hb. The rate of proteolysis of excess -globin chains may also be impor- tant—as may mechanisms that have little to do with genetic or molecular events.

Fig 8.41  thalassaemia showing Mexican hat cells (also called target cells)—one of which is arrowed on the left panel. Note also the tear-drop cell on the right panel, and the 2 normo blasts (nucleated red cells, one on each panel). The shorter arrow on the left panel points to a Howell– Jolly body. Note that the cells which are not Mexican hats are rather small (microcytic). There is also poikilocytosis (poikilos is Greek for varied—so this simply means that the red blood cells are of varied shape). Courtesy of Prof.
