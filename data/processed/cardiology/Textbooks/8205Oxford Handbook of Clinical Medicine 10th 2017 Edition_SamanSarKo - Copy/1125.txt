an alternative water supply) is king. Diarrhoea with blood (dysentery) Shigella (sonnei, fl exneri, dysenteriae, boydii): Gram Ωve anaerobe. Presentation: watery or bloody diarrhoea, pain, tenesmus, fever 1–2d after exposure. Lasts ~5–7d.  in MSM. Complications: bacteraemia, reactive arthritis (~2% of fl exneri), HUS (Shiga- toxin-producing dysenteriae, p315). Diagnosis: stool culture. PCR/enzyme immuno- assay. Treatment: supportive. Nutrition: green bananas (short-chain fatty acids in colon), zinc if age <6y, vitamin A. Antibiotics if systemically unwell, immunosup- pressed. Guided by local sensitivities (ciprofl oxacin, azithromycin). Avoid antidiar- rhoeal agents: risk of toxic dilatation. Enterohaemorrhagic/Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC), eg O157:H7: Gram Ωve anaerobe. Produces veratoxins which are ‘Shiga-like’ due to similarity with Shigella dysenteriae. Presentation: incubation 3–8d. Diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis. HUS in up to 10% (p315). Diagnosis: stool culture. PCR/enzyme immunoassay for Shiga-toxin. Treatment: Supportive. Do not give antibiotics:  risk of HUS. Campylobacter: Gram Ωve, spiral-shaped rod. Presentation: incubation 1–10d (usu- ally 2–5d). Bloody diarrhoea, pain, fever, headache. Complications: bacteraemia, hepatitis, pancreatitis, miscarriage, reactive arthritis, Guillain–Barré. Diagnosis: stool culture. PCR/enzyme immunoassay. Treatment: supportive. Antibiotics only in invasive cases, refer to local sensitivities (macrolide, doxycycline, quinolone). Salmonella enterocolitis (non-typhoidal): Gram Ωve, anaerobic, motile bacilli. Pres- entation: diarrhoea, cramps, fever, usually within 12–36h
