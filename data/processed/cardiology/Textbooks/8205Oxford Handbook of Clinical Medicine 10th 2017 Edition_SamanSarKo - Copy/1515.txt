few days post-op because of intubation and local oedema (NB: pre-operative fi breoptic laryngoscopy should be performed to exclude pre-exist- ing vocal cord dysfunction); thyroid storm (symptoms of severe hypert hyroidism—see p834); tracheal obstruction due to haematoma in the wound: relieve by immedi- ate removal of stitches or clips using the cutter/remover that should remain at the beside; may require urgent surgery; hypoparathyroidism (p222); check plasma Ca2+ daily; transient drops in serum concentration are common, permanent in 2 . 5%. Late: Hypothyroidism; recurrent hyperthyroidism. Mastectomy Arm lymphoedema in up to 20% of those undergoing axillary node sampling or dissection. The risk of lymphoedema increases with the level of axillary dissection: risk is lower with level 1 dissection (remains inferior to pec. minor) com- pared to level 3 dissection (goes superior to pec. minor, rarely done); skin necrosis. Arterial surgery Bleeding; thrombosis; embolism; graft infection; MI; AV fi stula formation. Complications of aortic surgery: Gut ischaemia; renal failure; respira- tory distress; trauma to ureters or anterior spinal artery (leading to paraplegia); ischaemic events from distal emboli from dislodged thrombus; aorto-enteric fi stula. Colonic surgery Early: Sepsis;ileus;fi stulae;anastomotic leak (11% for radical rectal surgery); haemorrhage; trauma to ureters or spleen. Late: Adhesional
