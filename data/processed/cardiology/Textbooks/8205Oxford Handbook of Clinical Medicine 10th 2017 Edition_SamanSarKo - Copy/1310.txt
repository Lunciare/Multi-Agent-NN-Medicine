and Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS, p512). Signs Sympathetic: Postural hypotension, sweating, ejaculatory failure, Horner’s syndrome (p702). Parasympathetic: Constipation, nocturnal dia rrhoea, urine retention, erectile dysf unction, Holmes–Adie pupil (p72). Autonomic function tests • BP: Postural drop of 20/10mmHg is abnormal. • ECG: A variation of <10bpm with respiration is abnormal (check R-R interval). •Cystometry: Bladder pressure studies. • Pupils: Instil 0.1% adrenaline (dilates if post-ganglionic sympathetic denerva- tion, not if normal); 2.5% cocaine (dilates if normal; not if sympathetic denerva- tion); 2.5% methacholine (constricts if parasympathetic lesion)—rarely used. • Paraneoplastic antibodies: Anti-HU, anti-YO, anti-RI, anti-amphiphysin, anti- CV2, anti-MA2. Other Ab: Antiganglionic acetylcholine receptor antibody pres- ence shows that the cause may be autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. Primary autonomic failure Occurs alone (autoimmune autonomic ganglion- opathy), as part of multisystem atrophy (MSA, p494), or with Parkinson’s dis- ease, typically in a middle-aged/elderly man.
