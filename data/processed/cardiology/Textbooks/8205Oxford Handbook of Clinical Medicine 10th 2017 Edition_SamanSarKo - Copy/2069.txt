deterioration. Mechanically ventilated patients can suddenly develop hypoxia or an increase in ventilation pressures. Signs: Reduced expansion, hyper-resonance to percussion, and diminished breath sounds on the aff ected side. With a tension pneumothorax, the trachea will be devi- ated away from the aff ected side and the patient will be very unwell. Tests A CXR should not be performed if a tension pneumothorax is suspected, as it will delay immediate necessary treatment. Otherwise, request an expiratory fi lm, and look for an area devoid of lung markings, peripheral to the edge of the collapsed lung (see p725). Ensure the suspected pneumothorax is not a large emphysematous bulla. Check ABG in dyspnoeic/hypoxic patients and those with chronic lung disease. Management See fi g 19.14. Depends on whether it is a primary pneumothorax or secondary (=underlying lung disease or smoker >50yrs old), size, and symptoms.9 • Size is measured from the visible lung margin to chest wall at level of the hilum. • Pneumothorax due to trauma or mechanical ventilation requires a chest drain. • Aspiration of a pneumothorax, see p767. • Insertion and management of a chest drain, see p766. Use a small tube (10–14F) unless blood/pus is also present. Tubes
