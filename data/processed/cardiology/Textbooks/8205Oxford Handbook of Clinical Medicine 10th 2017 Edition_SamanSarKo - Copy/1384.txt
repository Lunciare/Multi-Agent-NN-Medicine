Misconceptions are common: they are addictive, for the dying, if they use morphine now it will not work when they really need it. Respiratory depression is very rare when opioids are correctly titrated but opioids often get blamed when a patient deteriorates. Reassure pa- tients that opioids are effective and safe when used appropriately. Morphine-resistant pain: Seek expert help. Consider methadone, ketamine, and adjuvants such as NSAIDS, steroids, muscle relaxants, anxiolytics, nerve blocks. If neuropathic pain is suspected, try amitriptyline, pregabalin, or topical lidocaine. Consider the eff ect of psychological and spiritual well-being on pain (see p535). Rapid analgesia: Most PRN medication takes time to have an eff ect. If this is a problem, seek expert help regarding rapid-release preparations (eg sublingual, intranasal, or buccal fentanyl). Try to pre-empt times of high pain (eg dressing changes) and give analgesia in advance. Table 11.5 Opioid dose equivalents: conversions are not exact, potency can vary. If in doubt, use a dose below your estimate. Practice is variable: always defer to local guidelines fi rst. Relative potency 4h dose (mg) 24h dose (mg) Morphine PO
