idiopathic pulmonary fi brosis. Alterna- tives: If unsuccessful, consider open lung biopsy or video-assisted thoracoscopy. Surgical procedures are performed under general anaesthetic. Rigid bronchos- copy provides a wide lumen, enables larger mucosal biopsies, control of bleeding, and removal of foreign bodies. Mediastinoscopy and mediastinotomy enable ex- amination and biopsy of the mediastinal lymph nodes/lesions. Thoracoscopy allows examination and biopsy of pleural lesions, drainage of pleural eff usions, and talc pleurodesis and pleurectomy. 1 Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis causes cough, dyspnoea, and restrictive spirometry. It is caused by ac- cumulation of surfactant-derived acidophilic phospholipid/protein compounds which fi ll alveoli and distal bronchioles. Diagnosis may require lung biopsy. Cause: primary genetic or antibody problem, or secondary to infl ammation caused by inhaling silica, aluminium, or titanium. 3 __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 116644 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem tsehC 165 Fig 4.4 Lung volumes: physiological and pathological.
