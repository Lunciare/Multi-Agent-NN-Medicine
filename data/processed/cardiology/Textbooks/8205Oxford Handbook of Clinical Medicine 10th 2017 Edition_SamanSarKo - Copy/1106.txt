encephalitis, osteomyelitis. Endocarditis is the most common form of chronic disease. Diagnosis: Coxiella cannot be cultured using routine lab methods.17 PCR is rapid. Serology can take 2–6wks to become positive and detects variation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) coat. Phase II LPS appears before phase I LPS  acute infection = IgM/IgG to phase II LPS, chronic infection = IgG to phase I LPS. Se- rology on paired sera 2–4wks apart provides best diagnostic evidence. Treatment: Doxycycline. Also rifampicin, chloramphenicol, fl uoroquinolone, macrolide. Hydroxy- chloroquine alkalinizes the phagosomes in which the bacteria resides and may  bactericidal eff ect. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 442244 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI Leptospirosis (Weil’s disease) 425 Pathogenic leptospire spirochaetes belonging to the subgroup Leptospira interro- gans. >250 pathogenic serovars. Chronic renal infection of carrier animals: rodent, cattle, pigs. Spread by water/soil/food contaminated by infected animal urine. Pres- entation: Incubation ~7d (2–30d). 1st (acute/septicaemic) phase: fever, non-specifi c fl u-like symptoms. Mild/subclinical in ~90%. Followed by recovery or 2nd (immune/ leptospiruric) phase: conjunctival suff usion, myalgia (CK), jaundice, meningitis, uvei- tis, AKI, pulmonary haemorrhage, ARDS, myo/pericarditis. (Weil’s disease described in 1886: fever, jaundice splenomegaly, renal failure, CNS symptoms. Term now applied to all severe disease.) Diagnosis: In UK18 via National
