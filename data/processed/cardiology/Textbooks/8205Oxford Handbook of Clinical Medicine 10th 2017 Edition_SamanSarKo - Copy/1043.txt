For a treatment-naive patient consider two nucleoside reverse transcriptase in- hibitors (=’NRTI backbone’) plus one of: • ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor • non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor • integrase inhibitor. 1st line drugs commonly used in the UK include: • NRTI backbone: Tenofovir and emtricitabine (combination tablet=Truvada®), abacavir and lamivudine (combination tablet=Kivexa®). Side-eff ects: GI distur- bance, anorexia, pancreatitis, hepatic dysfunction (severe lactic acidosis with hepatomegaly and hepatic steatosis reported, caution with hepatitis B/C), bone- mineral density. Avoid abacavir if high risk of CVD. Avoid tenofovir if eGFR <30. • Protease inhibitors: Atazanavir, darunavir. Side-eff ects: hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance (mainly 1st-generation drugs), dyslipidaemia, jaundice, and hepatitis. • NNTRI: Rilpivirine (give with food, interaction with proton pump inhibitors), efa- virenz (CNS toxicity, association with suicidality  care in depression/anxiety, adverse lipid profi le). Other side-eff ects: rash, GI disturbance. • Integrase inhibitor: Dolutegravir, elvitegravir, raltegravir. Side-eff ects: rash,
