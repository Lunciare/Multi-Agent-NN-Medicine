Bence Jones protein Consists of light chains excreted in excess by some patients with myeloma (p368). They are not detected by dipsticks and may occur with normal serum electrophoresis. Haemoglobinuria Caused by intravascular haemolysis (p336). Myoglobinuria Caused by rhabdomyolysis (p319). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 668866 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC Table 14.6 C-reactive protein (CRP) 687 Marked elevation Normal-to-slight elevation Bacterial infection Viral infection Abscess Steroids/oestrogens Crohn’s disease Ulcerative colitis Connective tissue diseases (except SLE) SLE Neoplasia Morbid obesity Trauma Atherosclerosis Necrosis (eg MI) Fig 14.12 A normal electrophoretic scan. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 668877 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC 688 Plasma enzymes Reference intervals vary between laboratories. See p752 for a guide to normal values. Raised levels of specifi c enzymes can be a useful indicator of a disease. However, remember that most can be raised for other reasons too. Levels may be raised due to cellular damage, cell turnover, cellular proliferation (malignancy), enzyme induc- tion, and clearance. The major causes of raised enzymes: Alkaline phosphatase (Several distinguishable isoforms exist, eg liver and bone.) • Liver disease (suggests cholestasis; also cirrhosis, abscess, hepatitis, or malignancy). • Bone disease (isoenzyme distinguishable, refl ects osteoblast activity) especially Paget’s, growing children, healing fractures, bone metastases, osteomalacia, os- teomyelitis, chronic kidney
