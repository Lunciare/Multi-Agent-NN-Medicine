only if sentinel node +ve. Sentinel node identifi ed in 90%. False Ωve rates <5% for experienced surgeons. Prognostic factors in breast cancer Tumour size, grade, lymph node status, ER/PR status, presence of vascular invasion all help assess prognosis. Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) is widely used to predict survival and risk of relapse, and to help select appropriate adjuvant sys- temic therapy. NPI = 0.2 ≈ tumour size (cm) + histological grade + nodal status6 If treated with surgery alone, 10yr survival rates are: NPI <2.4: 95%; NPI 2.4–3.4: 85%; NPI 3.4–4.4: 70%; NPI 4.4–5.4: 50%; NPI >5.4: 20%. Benign breast disease Fibroadenoma: Usually presents <30yrs but can occur up to menopause. Benign overgrowth of collagenous mesenchyme of one breast lobule. Firm, smooth, mobile lump, the ‘breast mouse’. Painless. May be multiple. ⅓ regress, ⅓ stay the same, ⅓ get bigger. : observation and reassurance, but if in doubt refer for USS (usually conclusive) ± FNA. Surgical excision if large. Breast cysts: Common >35yrs, esp. perimenopausal. Benign, fl uid-fi lled rounded lump. Not fi xed to surrounding tissue. Occasionally painful. : diagnosis confi rmed on aspiration (perform only if trained). Infective mastitis/breast abscesses: Infection of mammary duct often associat- ed
