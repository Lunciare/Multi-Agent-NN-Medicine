It is much more sensi- tive in identifying metastases than X-ray, where lesions may not appear until >50% of bone matrix has been destroyed (fi g 16.27). Thyroid disease TcO is used for diff erentiating Graves’, toxic multinodular goitre, 4 and subacute thyroiditis (fi g 13.22, p601) as well as identifying ectopic tissue, func- tioning nodules, and residual/recurrent thyroid tissue after surgery. ~15% of cold (non-functioning) nodules are malignant. Hot nodules are often toxic adenomas. Phaeochromocytoma Iodine-123 (123I) meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) is taken up by sympathetic tissues, and indicates functioning, ectopic, and metastatic ad- renal medullary (+other neural crest) tumours. 131I-MIBG is also used for treatment. Hyperparathyroidism 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) scans can detect parathyroid adenomas. Haemorrhage Red cells are removed from the patient and labelled with 99mTc, then re- injected to allow identifi cation of a bleeding point. Used in both acute
