eosin ophil granules) have stopped being made, leaving the patient at risk of fatal infections. Many drugs can be the culprit: eg carbimazole, procainamide, sulfona- mides, gold, clozapine, dapsone. When starting drugs known to cause agranu- locytosis, warn patients to report any fever. Neutropenia (wcc 0.5≈109/L) may declare itself initially as a sore throat. Stop the drug, commence neutropenic regi- men and consider G-CSF if indicated (p352). Marrow support Red cells survive for ~120d, platelets for ~8d, and neutrophils for 1–2d, so early problems are mainly from neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. 1 Red cell transfusion: Transfusing 1U should raise Hb by ~10–15g/L (p348). Trans- fusion may drop the platelet count (you may need to give platelets before or after). 2 Platelets: Traumatic bleeds, purpura, and easy bruising occur if platelets <50≈109/L. Spontaneous bleeding may occur if platelets <20≈109/L, with intrac- ranial haemo rrhage rarely. Platelets are stored at room temperature (22°C; not in the fridge). In marrow transplant or if severely immunosuppressed, platelets may need irradiation before use to prevent transfusion-associated GVHD. Platelets must be ABO compatible. They are not used in ITP (p345). Indications: • Platelets <10≈109/L. • Haemorrhage (eg DIC, p352). • Before invasive procedures (eg biopsy, lumbar puncture)
