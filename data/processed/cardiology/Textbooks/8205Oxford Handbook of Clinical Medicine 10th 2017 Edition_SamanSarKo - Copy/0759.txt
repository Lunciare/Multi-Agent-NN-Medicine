A total of 80L of her blood was treated in this way, removing 60g of urea. After 11 hours she opened her eyes to declare, ‘I’m going to divorce my husband’. This she duly achieved, as well as making medical history. Kolff chose not to patent his life- saving invention but donated copies to hospitals across the world.
