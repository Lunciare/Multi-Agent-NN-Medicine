months for life. If the cause is dietary, then oral B12 can be given after the initial IM course (50–150mcg/daily, between meals). Im- provement is indicated by a transient marked reticulocytosis (MCV), after 4–5 days. Practical hints: • Beware of diagnosing PA in those under 40yrs old: look for GI ma- labsorption (small bowel biopsy, p266). • Watch for hypokalaemia due to uptake into new haematopoietic cells. • Transfusion is best avoided, but PA with high-output CCF may require transfusion, after doing tests for FBC, folate, B12, and marrow sampling. • As haematopoiesis accelerates on treatment, additional iron may be needed. • Hb rises ~10g/L per week; WCC and platelet count should normalize in 1wk. Prognosis: Supplementation usually improves peripheral neuropathy within the fi rst 3–6 months, but has little eff ect on cord signs. Patients do best if treated as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms: don’t delay! 4 Serum B12 levels are normal in many patients with subclinical B12 defi ciency. Measuring homocysteine or methylmalonic acid ( if B12 low) may be helpful, but these are non-standard tests. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 333344 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 335 Fig 8.27 The big, beefy tongue of B12 defi ciency glossitis.
