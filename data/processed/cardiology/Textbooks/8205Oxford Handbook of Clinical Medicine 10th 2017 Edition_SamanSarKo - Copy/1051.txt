6 (HHV6): Roseola infantum, febrile illness without rash. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8): Oncogenic (see BOX ‘Oncogenic viruses’), Castleman’s disease. Oncogenic viruses ~12% of human cancers are caused by viruses, >80% of these occur in low- and middle-income countries (table 9.12). Common traits of oncoviruses: • Virus is necessary but not suffi cient to cause cancer. • Cancers appear in context of chronic infection, taking years-decades to appear. • Immune system has variable role: cancers are associated with both immunosup- pression and chronic infl ammation.
