IV access with 2 large-bore cannulae. Treat shock with O RhΩve blood (if not cross matched), but keep systolic BP ≤100mmHg to avoid rupturing a contained leak (NB: raised BP is common early on).  Take the patient straight to theatre. Don’t waste time on X-rays: fatal delay may result, though CT can help in a stable patient with an uncertain diagnosis.  Give prophylactic antibiotics, eg co-amoxiclav 625mg IV.  Surgery involves clamping the aorta above the leak, and inserting a Dacron® graft (eg ‘tube graft’ or, if signifi cant iliac aneurysm also, a ‘trouser graft’ with each ‘leg’ attached to an iliac artery). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 665544 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Thoracic aortic dissection 655 Blood splits the aortic media with sudden tearing chest pain (± radiation to back). As the dissection extends, branches of the aorta occlude sequentially leading to hemiplegia (carotid artery), unequal arm pulses and BP, or acute limb ischaemia, para plegia (anterior spinal artery), and anuria (renal arteries). Aortic valve incom- petence, inferior MI, and cardiac arrest may develop if dissection moves proximally. Type A (70%) dissections involve the ascending aorta, irrespective of site of the tear, while if the ascending aorta is not involved it is
