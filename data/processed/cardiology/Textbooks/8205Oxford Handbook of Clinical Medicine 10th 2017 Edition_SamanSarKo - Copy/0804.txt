• Deceased donor: (See organ donation p13.) 1 Donor after brain death (DBD, heart-beating donor). 2 Expanded criteria donor (ECD) is from an older kidney or from a patient with a history of CVA, BP, or CKD. This impacts on the long-term prognosis of the trans- plant but off ers a better outcome than remaining on dialysis. 3 Donor after cardiac death (DCD, non-heart-beating donor) with risk of delayed graft function. Immunosuppression A combination of drugs are used. Aim is to use the minimal eff ective dose with the lowest drug-related toxicity. Protocol used depends upon the immunological risk of the recipient and type of donated kidney. Monoclonal antibodies: Eg basiliximab, daclizumab (selectively block activated T cells via CD-25), alemtuzumab (T- and B-cell depletion). Used at the time of trans- plantation (‘induction’). Acute rejection and graft loss, infection risk if non-selective. Calcineurin inhibitors: Eg tacrolimus, ciclosporin. These drugs inhibit T-cell acti- vation and proliferation. Inter-individual variation and narrow therapeutic index mean drug level monitoring is required. Clearance is dependent on cytochrome p450 isoenzymes so beware of drug interactions including macrolide antibiotics and anti- fungal drugs. Side eff ects: nephrotoxicity in the graft, modifi cation of CV risk factors: BP, cholesterol,
