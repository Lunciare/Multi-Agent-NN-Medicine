To produce synchronous eye move- ments, cranial nerves III, IV, and VI communicate through medial long itu dinal fasciculus in midbrain. In INO, a lesion disrupts commun - i cation, causing weakness in ad- duction of the ipsilate ral eye with nystagmus of the contralateral eye only when abducting. There may be incomplete or slow abduction of the ipsilateral eye during lateral gaze. Convergence is preserved. Causes MS or vascular (rarely: HIV; syphilis; Lyme disease; brainstem tumours; phenothiazine toxicity). Ptosis Drooping of the upper eyelid. Best observed with patient sitting up, with head held by examiner. Oculomotor nerve (CN III) innervates main muscle concerned (levator palpebrae), but nerves from the cervical sympathetic chain innervate superior tar- sal muscle, and a lesion of these nerves causes mild ptosis which can be overcome on looking up. Causes: 1 CN III lesions cause unilateral complete ptosis: look for other evidence of a CN III lesion: ophtha lmoplegia with ‘down and out’ deviation of the eye, pupil dil ated and unreactive to light or accommodation.
