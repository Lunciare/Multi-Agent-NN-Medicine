carcinoid tumours <1cm can be resected endoscopically. Debulking (eg enucleating), embolization, or radiofrequency ablation of hepatic metastases can  symptoms. Give octreotide cover to avoid precipitating a massive carcinoid crisis. Median survival 5–8yrs (~3yrs if metastases are present, but may be up to 20yrs; so beware of giving up too easily, even in metastatic disease). Carcinoid crisis When a tumour outgrows its blood supply or is handled too much during sur- gery, mediators fl ood out. There is life-threatening vasodilation, hypotension, tachycardia, bronchoconstriction, and hyperglycaemia. It is treated with high- dose octreotide, supportive measures, and careful management of fl uid balance (ie a central line is needed—see p775 for insertion technique).
