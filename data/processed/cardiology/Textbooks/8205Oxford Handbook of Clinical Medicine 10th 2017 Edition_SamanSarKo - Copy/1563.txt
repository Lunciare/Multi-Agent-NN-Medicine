nodules can usually be observed provided they are: • <1cm across (which accounts for most; ultrasound can detect lumps <2mm; such ‘incidentalomas’ occur in 46% of routine autopsies) and are asymptomatic. • There is no past history of thyroid cancer or neck irradiation. • No family history of medullary cancer (if present, do USS-guided FNA). Thyroid cancer 1 Papillary: (60%.) Often in younger patients. Spread: lymph nodes and lung (jugulo- digastric node metastasis is the so-called lateral aberrant thyroid). : total thyroid- ectomy to remove non-obvious tumour ± node excision ± radioiodine (131I) to ablate residual cells. Give levothyroxine to suppress TSH. Prognosis: better if young and . 2 Follicular: (≤25%.) Occurs in middle-age and spreads early via blood (bone, lungs). Well-diff erentiated. : total thyroidectomy + T4 suppression + radioiodine ablation. 3 Medullary: (5%.) Sporadic (80%) or part of MEN syndrome (p223). May produce calcitonin which can be used as a tumour marker. They do not concentrate iodine. Perform a phaeochromocytoma screen pre-op. : thyroidectomy + node clear- ance. External beam radiot herapy may prevent regional recurrence. 4 Lymphoma: (5%.) :≈3:1. May present with stridor or dysphagia. Do full stag- ing pre-treatment (chemoradiotherapy). Assess histology for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue
