The para protein is recognized as a monoclo- nal band (M band) on serum electrophoresis.9 There are six major categories: 1 Multiple myeloma See p368. 2 Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia This is a lymphoplasmacytoid lympho- ma producing a monoclonal IgM paraprotein. Hyperviscosity is common (p372), with CNS and ocular symptoms. Lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly are also seen. ESR, with IgM paraprotein on serum electrophoresis. : None if asympto- matic. Chlorambucil, fl udarabine, or combination chemotherapy may be used. Plasmapheresis9 for hyperviscosity (p372). 3 Primary amyloidosis See following topic. 4 Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain signifi cance (MGUS) is common (3% >70yrs). There is a paraprotein in the serum but no myeloma, 1° amyloid, macro- globulinaemia, or lymphoma, with no bone lesions, no Bence Jones protein, and a low concentration of paraprotein, with <10% plasma cells in the marrow. Some develop myeloma or lymphoma. Refer to a haematologist (?for marrow biopsy). 5 Paraproteinaemia in lymphoma or leukaemia Eg seen in5 % of CLL. 6 Heavy chain disease Neoplastic cells produce free Ig heavy chains.  chain dis- ease is most important,
