an immune response suffi cient to confer protection. Research is ongoing into neutralizing HIV antibodies, peptides, genes, viral vectors, physiological ‘boost- ers’, and mechanisms to counter the mutational evolution of HIV.

HSV1 infection in ⅔ of world’s population (~3.7 billion <50yrs), and HSV2 in ~11% (~400 million). Viruses multiply in epithelial cells of mucosal surface producing vesicles or ulcers. Lifelong latent infection when virus enters sensory neu- rons at infection site. Can then reactivate, replicate, and infect surrounding tissue. Disseminated infection if impaired T-cell immunity: pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis. Presentation: Primary infection: subclinical or sensory nerve (tingling) prodrome, then vesicles, shallow ulcers. Systemic symptoms possible: fever, malaise, lymphad- enopathy. Heals 8–12d. Reactivation: usually severe unless immunosuppressed. Anatomy of infection: • Herpes labialis: cold sore lesion at lip border, predominantly HSV1. • Genital herpes: predominantly HSV2 (see p412). • Gingivostomatitis: fever, sore throat followed by tender oropharyngeal vesicles. • Keratoconjunctivitis: corneal dendritic ulcers. Avoid steroids. See OHCS p416. • Herpetic whitlow: painful vesicles on distal phalanx due to inoculation through a break in the skin. • Herpes encephalitis:
