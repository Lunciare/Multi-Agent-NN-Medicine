of patients with unilateral involvement develop seizures by age 1yr (95% if bilat- eral)—due (in part) to the increased metabolic demand of a developing brain in the setting of vascular compromise. Early management of seizures is critical to minimize brain injury. Some patients have severe cognitive and neurologic defi cits beyond simple seizure activity. Screen early for glaucoma (50%). EEG and MRI help establish early diagnosis and treatment in patients at risk for SWS. Treat the PWS early with pulsed dye laser.
