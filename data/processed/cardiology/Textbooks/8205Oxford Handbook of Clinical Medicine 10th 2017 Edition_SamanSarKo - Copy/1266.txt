of vascular dementia. Risk factors 1st-degree relative with AD; Down’s syndrome (in which AD is in- evitable, often <40yrs); homozygosity for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) E4 allele (see BOX ‘Genetics and the future’); PICALM, CL1 & CLU variants; vascular risk factors (BP, dia- betes, dyslipidaemia, homocysteine, AF); physical/cognitive activity; depression; loneliness (risk ≈ 2; simply living alone is not a risk factor); smoking. Management See p486 for a general approach to management in dementia. • Refer to a specialist memory service. • Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (see BOX ‘Pharmacological treatment’). • BP control (in heart failure there is a 2x risk of AD; extra risk halves with BP control). Prevention in the context of AD’s time-course: Changes in CSF -amyloid are seen ~25yrs before onset of unequivocal symptoms (USy) and its deposition is detected 15yrs before USy. CSF tau protein and brain atrophy are also detected 15yrs before USy. Cerebral hypometabolism and impaired episodic memory occur 10yrs before USy. Global cognitive impairment occurs 5yrs before USy. Prevention will probably be most eff ective before any of this starts—though there is currently insuffi cient evidence to recommend any specifi c interventions (BOX ‘Genetics and the future’). Ultimately, there is no simple relationship between brain
