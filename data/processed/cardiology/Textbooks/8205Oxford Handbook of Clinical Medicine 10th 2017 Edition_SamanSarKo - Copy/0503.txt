90%: Stage 0: normal. Stage 1: BHL. Stage 2: BHL + peripheral pulmonary infi ltrates. Stage 3: peripheral pulmonary infi ltrates alone. Stage 4: progressive pulmonary fi brosis; bulla formation (honey- combing); pleural involvement. ECG may show arrhythmias or bundle branch block. Lung function tests may be normal or show reduced lung volumes, impaired gas transfer, and a restrictive ventilatory defect. Tissue biopsy (lung, liver, lymph nodes, skin nodules, or lacrimal glands) is diagnostic and shows non-caseating granulo- mata. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL): Shows lymphocytes in active disease; neutrophils with pulmonary fi brosis. Transbrochial biopsy: May be diagnostic. Ultrasound: May show nephrocalcinosis or hepatosplenomegaly. Bone X-rays: Show ‘punched out’ lesions in terminal phalanges. CT/MRI: May be useful in assessing severity of pulmonary disease or diagnosing neurosarcoidosis. Ophthalmology assessment (slit lamp examination, fl uorescein angiography) is indicated in ocular disease. Management Patients with BHL alone don’t need treatment as most recover spon- taneously.53, 54 Acute sarcoidosis: bed rest, NSAIDS. Indications for corticosteroids: • Parenchymal lung disease (symptomatic, static, or progressive). • Uveitis. • Hypercalcaemia. • Neurological or cardiac involvement. Prednisolone (40mg/24h) PO for 4–6 wks, then dose over 1yr according to clinical status. A few patients relapse and may need a further
