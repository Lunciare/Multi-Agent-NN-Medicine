aortic stenosis, HCM; micturition syncope happens during or after urination: mostly men, at night. Carotid sinus syncope Hypersensitive baroreceptors cause excessive refl ex brady- cardia ± vasodilation on minimal stimulation (eg head-turning, shaving). Epilepsy (p490) Features suggestive of this diagnosis include: attacks when asleep or lying down; aura; identifi able triggers (eg TV); altered breathing; cyanosis; typical tonic–clonic movements; incontinence of urine; tongue-biting; prolonged post-ictal drowsiness, confusion, amnesia, and transient focal paralysis (Todd’s palsy). Stokes–Adams attacks Transient arrhythmias (eg bradycardia due to complete heart block) cause cardiac output and LOC. The patient falls to the ground (often with no warning except palpitations; injuries are common), and is pale, with a slow or absent pulse. Recovery is in seconds: the patient fl ushes, the pulse speeds up, and consciousness is regained. As with vasovagal syncope, anoxic clonic jerks may occur in prolonged LOC. Attacks may happen several times a day and in any posture. Other causes Hypoglycaemia: (p214) Tremor, hunger, and perspiration herald light- headedness or LOC; rare in non-diabetics. Orthostatic hypotension: Unsteadiness or LOC on standing from lying in those with inadequate vasomotor refl exes: the elderly; autonomic neuropathy (p505); antihypertensive medication; overdiuresis; multisys- tem atrophy (MSA; p494). Anxiety: Hyperventilation,
