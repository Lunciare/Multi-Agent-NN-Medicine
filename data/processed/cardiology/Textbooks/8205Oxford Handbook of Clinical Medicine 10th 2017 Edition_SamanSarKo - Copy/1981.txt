Indications Upper airway obstruction when endotracheal intubation not possible, eg irretrievable foreign body; facial oedema (burns, angio-oedema); maxillofacial trauma; infection (epiglottitis). Procedure Lie the patient supine with neck extended (eg pillow under shoulders) unless there is suspected cervical-spine instability. Run your index fi nger down the neck anteriorly in the midline to fi nd the notch in the upper border of the thyroid cartilage (the Adam’s apple): just below this, between the thyroid and cricoid carti- lages, is a depression—the cricothyroid membrane (see fi g 18.14). If you cannot feel the depression and it is an emergency, you can access the trachea directly ap- proximately halfway between the cricoid cartilage and the suprasternal notch. Ideally use a purpose-designed kit (eg QuickTrach∏, MiniTrach∏), all hos- pitals will stock one version. If no kit is available then a cannula (needle crico- thyroidotomy) can buy time, and in out- of-hospital situations a blade and empty biro case have saved lives. Needle and kit cricothyroidotomies are temporary Fig 18.14 The cricothyroid membrane. measures pending formal tracheostomy. 1 Needle cricothyroidotomy: Pierce the membrane perpendicular to
