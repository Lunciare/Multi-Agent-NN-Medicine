CT abdomen is best to confi rm acute diverticulitis and can identify extent of disease and any complications (eg colovesical fi stulae). Colonoscopy risk perforation in acute setting. AXR may identify obstruction or free air (perforation). Diverticular disease Altered bowel habit ± left-sided colic relieved by defecation; nausea and fl atulence. High-fi bre diets do not help symptoms; try antispasmodics, eg mebeverine 135mg/8h PO. Surgical resection occasionally resorted to. Diverticulitis features above + pyrexia, WCC, CRP/ESR, a tender colon ± localized or generalized peritonism. Mild attacks can be treated at home with bowel rest (fl uids only) ± antibiotics. If fl uids and pain not tolerated, admit for analgesia, NBM, IV fl uids and IV antibiotics. Most attacks settle but complications include abscess formation (neces sitating percutaneous CT-guided drainage), or perforation. Beware diverticu- litis in immunocompromised patients (eg on steroids) who often have few symptoms and may present late. Surgery The need for surgery is refl ected by the degree of infective complications: Stage 1 Pericolic or mesenteric abscess Surgery rarely needed Stage 2 Walled off or pelvic abscess May resolve without surgery Stage 3 Generalized purulent peritonitis Surgery required Stage 4 Generalized faecal peritonitis Surgery required Indications for elective
