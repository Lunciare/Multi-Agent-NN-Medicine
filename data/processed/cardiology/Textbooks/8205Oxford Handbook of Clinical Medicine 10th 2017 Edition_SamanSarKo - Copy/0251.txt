Movement disorders Symptoms of movement disorders Athetosis is due to a lesion in the putamen, causing slow sinuous writhing move- ments in the hands, which are present at rest. Pseudoathetosis refers to athetoid movements in patients with severe proprioceptive loss. Chorea means dance (hence ‘choreography’)—a fl ow of jerky movements, fl itting from one limb to another (each seemingly a fragment of a normal movement). Distinguish from athetosis/pseudoathetosis (above-mentioned), and hemiballis- mus (p468). Causes: Basal ganglia lesion (stroke, Huntington’s, p702); streptococci (Sydenham’s chorea; St Vitus’ dance, p142); SLE (p554); Wilson’s (p285); neonatal ker- nicterus; polycythaemia (p366); neuroacanthocytosis (genetic, with acanthocytes in peripheral blood, chorea, oro-facial dyskinesia, and axonal neuropathy); hyperthy- roidism (p218); drugs (levodopa, oral contraceptives/HRT, chlorpromazine, cocaine— ‘crack dancing’). The early stages of chorea may be detected by feeling fl uctuations in muscle tension while the patient grips your fi nger. : Dopamine antagonists, eg tetrabenazine 12.5mg/12h (/24h if elderly) PO; increase, eg to 25mg/8h PO; max 200mg/d. Hemiballismus is uncontrolled unilateral fl
