How does that compare with previous results? If you do not have any, ask the transplant unit. 3 Examine for and treat any reversible cause of AKI.

Correction of volume depletion and treatment of any sepsis should be prompt. 4 Consider viral/opportunistic infections and atypical presentations due to im- munosuppression, eg CMV, Pneumocystis jirovecii. 5 Do not stop any immunosuppressive medication.If the patient is unable to tolerate oral medication then immunosuppression must be given NG or convert ed to an IV dose (conversion depends on drug: check with your pharmacist). 6 Check for medication interactions: macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin) can cause calcineurin inhibitor toxicity. 7 Dose all drugs according to renal function: penicillins, cephalosporins, amino- glycosides, insulin, opiates, and low-molecular-weight heparin. 8 Check with
