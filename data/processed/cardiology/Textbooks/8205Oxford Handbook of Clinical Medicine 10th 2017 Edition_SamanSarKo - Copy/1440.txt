Rheumatological: Rheumatoid factor (RhF) positive in: Sjögren’s syndrome ≤100% Mixed connective tissue disease 50% Felty’s syndrome ≤100% SLE ≤40% RA 70% Systemic sclerosis 30% Infection (SBE/IE; hepatitis) ≤50% Normal 2–10% Anticyclic citrullinated peptide Ab (anti-CCP): 5 rheumatoid arthritis (~96% specifi city) Antinuclear antibody (ANA) positive by immunofl uorescence in: SLE >95% Systemic sclerosis 96% Autoimmune hepatitis 75% RA 30% Sjögren’s syndrome 68% Normal 0–2% ANA titres are expressed according to dilutions at which antibodies can be detected, ie 1:160 means antibodies can still be detected after the serum has been diluted 160 times. Titres of 1:40 or 1:80 may not be signifi cant. The pattern of staining may indicate the disease (although these are not specifi c): • Homogeneous SLE • Nucleolar Systemic sclerosis • Speckled Mixed CT disease • Centromere Limited systemic sclerosis Anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA): SLE (60% sensitivity, but highly specifi c). Antihistone Ab: drug-induced SLE (~100%). Antiphospholipid Ab (eg anti-cardiolipin Ab): antiphospholipid syndrome, SLE. Anticentromere Ab: limited systemic sclerosis. Anti-extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) antibodies (usually with +ve ANA): • Anti-Ro (SSA)
