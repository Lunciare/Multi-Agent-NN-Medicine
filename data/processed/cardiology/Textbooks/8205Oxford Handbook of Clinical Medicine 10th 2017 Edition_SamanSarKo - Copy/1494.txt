analgesia is not often used and eff ects are hard to determine. The aim is to dampen pain signals before they arrive. In children or anxious adults, local anaesthetic cream may be used on a few sites before inserting an IVI (the anaesthetist may prefer to site the cannula themselves!). • Anti-emetics: Post-operative nausea and vomiting is experienced by ~25% of all patients. 5HT3 antagonists (eg ondansetron 4mg IV/IM) are the most eff ective agents; others, eg metoclopramide 10mg/8h IV/IM/PO, are also used—see p251. • Antacids: Ranitidine 50mg IV or omeprazole 40mg PO/IV if aspiration risk. • Antisialogues: Glycopyrronium (200–400mcg in adults, 4–8mcg/kg in children; given IV/IM 30–60min before induction) is sometimes used to decrease secretions that may cause respiratory obstruction in smaller airways. • Antibiotics: See p570. Side-eff ects of anaesthetic agents • Hyoscine, atropine: Anticholinergic,  tachycardia, urinary retention, glaucoma, sedation (especially in the elderly). • Opioids: Respiratory depression, cough refl ex, nausea and vomiting, constipation. • Thiopental: (Induction agent.) Laryngospasm. • Propofol: (Induction agent.) Respiratory/cardiac depression, pain on injection. • Volatile agents, eg isofl urane: Nausea and vomiting, cardiac depression, respira- tory depression, vasodilation, hepatotoxicity (see BNF). The complications of anaesthesia are due to loss of: •
