AF’. Rate control: -blocker or rate-limiting Ca2+ blocker are 1st choice. If this fails, add digoxin (p115), then consider amiodarone. Digoxin as monotherapy in chronic AF is only acceptable in sedentary patients. Do not give -blockers with verapamil. Aim for heart rate <90bpm at rest and 200 minus age (yrs) bpm on exertion. Avoid getting fi xated on a target heart rate. Rhythm control: Elective DC cardioversion: do echo fi rst to check for intracardiac thrombi. If there is risk of cardioversion failure (past failure, or past recurrence) give amiodarone for 4wks before the procedure and 12 months after. Elective phar- macological cardioversion: fl ecainide is 1st choice (CI if structural heart disease, eg scar tissue from MI: use IV amiodarone instead). In refractory cases, AVN ablation with pacing, pulmonary vein ablation, or the maze procedure may be considered.28 Paroxysmal AF: ‘Pill in the pocket’ (eg sotalol or fl ecainide PRN) may be tried if: infre- q uent AF, BP >100mmHg systolic, no past LV dysfunction. Anticoagulate (See BOX ‘Anticoagulation and AF’). Consider ablation if symptomatic or frequent episodes. Atrial fl utter See pp130–1, fi g 3.35. Treatment: Similar to AF regarding rate and rhythm control and the need for
