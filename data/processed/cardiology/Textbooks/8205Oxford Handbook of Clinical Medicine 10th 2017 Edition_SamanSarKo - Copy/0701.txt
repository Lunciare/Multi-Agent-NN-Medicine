(p405), EBV (p405); drugs (see ta- ble 6.10); alcohol; cirrhosis (see BOX ‘Causes of jaundice’); liver metastases/abscess; haemo chromatosis; autoimmune hepatitis (AIH); septicaemia; leptospirosis; syphilis; 1-anti trypsin defi ciency (p290); Budd–Chiari (p696); Wilson’s disease (p285); failure to excrete conjugated bilirubin (Dubin–Johnson & Rotor syndromes, p698, p710); right heart failure; toxins, eg carbon tetrachloride; fungi (fi g 6.26). Impaired hepatic excretion (cholestasis): Primary biliary cholangitis; primary sclerosing cholangitis; drugs (see table 6.10); common bile duct gallstones; pan- creatic cancer; compression of the bile duct, eg lymph nodes at the porta hepatis; cholangiocarcinoma; choledochal cyst; Caroli’s disease;23 Mirrizi’s syndrome (ob- structive jaundice from common bile duct compression by a gallstone impacted in the cystic duct, often associated with cholangitis). The patient Ask: About blood transfusions, IV drug use, body piercing, tattoos, sexual activity, travel abroad, jaundiced contacts, family history, alcohol use, and all medications (eg old drug charts; GP records). Examine: For signs of chronic liver dis- ease (p276), hepatic encephalopathy (p275), lymph adenopathy, hepatomegaly, spleno- megaly, ascites, and a palpable gallbladder (if seen with painless jaundice the cause is not gallstones—Courvoisier’s ‘law’).24 Pale stools + dark urine ≈ cholestatic jaundice. Tests See p276 for screening tests in suspected liver disease. Urine:
