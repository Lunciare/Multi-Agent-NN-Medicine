Liver transplant is the mainstay for end-stage disease; recurrence oc- curs in up to 30%; 5yr graft survival is >60%. Prognosis is worse for those with IBD, as 5–10% develop colorectal cancer post-transplant. Ursodeoxycholic acid may improve LFT but has not shown evidence of survival benefi t. High doses, eg 25–30mg/ kg/d, may be harmful. Colestyra mine 4–8g/24h PO for pruritus (naltrexone and ri- fampicin may also help). Antibiotics for bacterial cholangitis. 31 Other causes of liver granulomas: TB, sarcoid, infections with HIV (eg toxoplasmosis, CMV, mycobacte- ria), PAN, SLE, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, lymphoma, syphilis, isoniazid, quinidine, carbamazepine, al- lopurinol. Signs: PUO; LFT. 32 Usually gallbladder polyps are an incidental fi nding on ultrasound, and they can often be left if <1cm diameter, but in PSC they are much more likely to become malignant. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 228822 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG Testing for autoantibodies—the anguish of partial understanding 283 The diagnostic approach to several infl ammatory conditions includes the measure- ment of autoantibodies. Consequently and all too often, attempts to acquire (and test) medical knowledge may promote these antibody panels to a position as the fi nal arbiter of disease diagnosis which, with their varying sensitivities and spe- cifi cities, they are
