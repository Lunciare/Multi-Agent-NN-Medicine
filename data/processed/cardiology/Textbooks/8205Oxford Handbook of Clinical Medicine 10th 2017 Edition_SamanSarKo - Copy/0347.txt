not delay treatment in order to start anticoagulation. • If the patient is stable & AF started <48h ago: rate or rhythm control may be tried. For rhythm control, DC cardiovert or give fl ecainide (CI: structural heart disease, IHD) or amiodarone. Start heparin in case cardioversion is delayed (see BOX ‘Anti- coagulation and AF’). • If the patient is stable & AF started >48h ago or unclear time of onset: rate control (eg with bisoprolol or diltiazem). If rhythm control is chosen, the patient must be anticoagulated for >3wks fi rst. • Correct electrolyte imbalances (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+);  associated illnesses (eg MI, pneu- monia); and consider anticoagulation (see BOX ‘Anticoagulation and AF’). Managing chronic AF The main goals are rate control and anticoagulation. Rate control is at least as good as rhythm control, 27 but rhythm control may be appropriate if • symptomatic or CCF • younger • presenting for 1st time with lone AF • AF from a corrected precipitant (eg U&E). Anticoagulation: See BOX ‘Anticoagulation and AF’. Rate control: -blocker or rate-limiting Ca2+ blocker are 1st choice. If this fails, add digoxin (p115), then consider amiodarone. Digoxin as monotherapy in chronic AF is only acceptable in
