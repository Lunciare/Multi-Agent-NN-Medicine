cause (internuclear ophthalmoplegia, see fi g 2.34). If also deafness/tinnitus, suspect a peripheral cause (eg VIIIth nerve lesion, barotrauma, Ménière’s, p462). If it varies with head position, suspect benign positional vertigo (p462). If it is up-and-down, ask a neurologist to review—upbeat nystagmus classically occurs with lesions in the midbrain or at the base of the 4th ventricle, downbeat nystagmus in foramen magnum lesions. Nystagmus lasting ≤2 beats is normal, as is nystagmus at the extremes of gaze. • V: Motor palsy—‘Open your mouth’; jaw deviates to side of lesion, muscles of mas- tication (temporalis, masseter and pterygoids). Sensory—check all three divisions. Consider corneal refl ex (lost fi rst). • VII: p Facial nerve lesions cause droop and weakness. As the forehead has bilateral representation in the brain, only the lower two-thirds is aff ected in UMN lesions, but all of one side of the face in LMN lesions. Ask to ‘raise your eyebrows’, ‘show me your teeth’, ‘puff out your cheeks’. Test taste with salt/sweet solutions (supplies anterior two-thirds of tongue). • VIII: Hearing—p464. Ask to repeat a number whispered in an ear while you block the other. Perform Weber’s and Rinne’s tests (p464). Balance/vertigo—p462. • IX p & X:
