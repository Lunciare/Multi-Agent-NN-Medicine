pressure (ICP) The volume inside the cranium is fi xed, so any increase in the contents can lead to raised ICP. This can be mass eff ect, oedema, or obstruction to fl uid outfl ow. Normal ICP in adults is <15mmHg. Causes • Primary or metastatic tumours. • Head injury. • Haemorrhage (subdural, extradural, subarachnoid, intracerebral, intraventricular). • Infection: meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess. • Hydrocephalus. • Cerebral oedema. • Status epilepticus. Signs and symptoms • Headache (worse on coughing, leaning forwards), vomiting. • Altered GCS: drowsiness, listlessness, irritability, coma. • History of trauma. • HR and BP (Cushing’s response); Cheyne–Stokes respiration. • Pupil changes (constriction at fi rst, later dilation—do not mask these signs by using agents such as tropicamide to dilate the pupil to aid fundoscopy). • Visual acuity; peripheral visual fi eld loss. • Papilloedema is an unreliable sign, but venous pulsation at the disc may be absent (absent in ~50% of normal people, but loss of it is a useful sign). Investigations • U&E, FBC, LFT, glucose, serum osmolality, clotting, blood culture. • Consider toxicology screen. • CXR—any source of infection that might indicate abscess? • CT head. • Then consider LP if safe.
