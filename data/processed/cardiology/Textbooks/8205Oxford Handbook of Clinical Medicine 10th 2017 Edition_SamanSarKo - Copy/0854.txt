usual reason that IDA fails to respond to iron replacement is that the patient has rejected the pills—check compliance. Is the reason for the problem GI distur- bance? Altering the dose of elemental iron with a diff erent preparation may help. Alternatively, there may be continued blood loss, malabsorption, anaemia of chron- ic disease; or misdiagnosis, eg when thalassaemia is to blame. Anaemia of chronic disease (secondary anaemia) The commonest anaemia in hospital patients (and the 2nd commonest, after IDA, worldwide). It arises from three problems (in which the polypeptide, hepcidin, plays a key role): 1 Poor use of iron in erythropoiesis. 2 Cytok ine-induced shortening of RBC survival. 3 Production of and response to erythropoietin. Causes Many, eg chronic infection, vasculitis, rheumatoid, malignancy, renal failure. Tests Ferritin normal or  in mild normocytic or microcytic anaemia (eg Hb >80g/L; see table 8.1). Check blood fi lm, B12, folate, TSH, and tests for haemolysis (p336). Treatment Treating the underlying disease may help (eg in 60% of patients with RA), as may erythropoietin (SE: fl u-like symptoms, hypertension, mild rise in the platelet count and thromboembolism). Also eff ective in improving quality of life in malignant disease. IV iron can safely
