pacing than to try temporary transvenous pacing, which often has complications (see later in topic) and therefore may delay a defi nitive procedure. Possible indications in the acute phase of myocardial infarction • Complete AV block: • With inferior MI (right coronary artery occlusion) pacing may only be needed if symptomatic; spontaneous recovery may occur. • With anterior MI (representing massive septal infarction). • Second-degree block: • Wenckebach (p99; implies decremental AV node conduction; may respond to atropine in an inferior MI; pace if anterior MI). • Mobitz type 2 block is usually associated with distal fascicular disease and car- ries high risk of complete heart block, so pace in both types of MI. • First-degree block: Observe carefully: 40% develop higher degrees of block. • Bundle branch block: Pace prophylactically if evidence of trifascicular disease (p100) or non-adjacent bifascicular disease. • Sino-atrial disease + serious symptoms: Pace unless responds to atropine. Other indications where temporary pacing may be needed • Pre-op: if surgery is required in patients with type 2 or complete heart block (whether or not MI has occurred); do 24h ECG; liaise with the anaesthetist. • Drug poisoning, eg with -blockers, digoxin, or verapamil. • Symptomatic bradycardia,
