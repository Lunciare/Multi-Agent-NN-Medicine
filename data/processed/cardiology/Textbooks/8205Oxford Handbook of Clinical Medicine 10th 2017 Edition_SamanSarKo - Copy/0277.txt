S Q S Q QS Fig 3.2 ‘QRS’ complexes. If the fi rst defl ection from the isoelectric line is negative, it is a Q wave. Any positive defl ection is an R wave. Any negative defl ection after an R is an S. • QRS complex: See fi g 3.2. Normal duration: <0.12s. QRS >0.12s suggests ventricular conduction defects, eg a bundle branch block (pp99, 100), metabolic disturbance, or ventricular origin (eg ventricular ectopic). High-amplitude QRS complexes suggest ventricular hypertrophy (p100). Normal Q waves are <0.04s wide and <2mm deep; they are often seen in leads I , aVL , V5, and V6 and refl ect normal septal depolariza- tion. Pathological Q waves (deep and wide) may occur within a few hours of an acute MI. • QT interval: Measure from start of QRS to end of T wave. It varies with rate. The corrected QT interval (QTc) is the QT interval divided by the square root of the R–R interval, ie QTc=QT/√RR. Normal QTc: 0.38–0.42s. For causes of prolonged QT interval see p711. Long QT can lead to VT and sudden death. • ST segment: Usually isoelectric. Planar elevation (>1mm) or depression (>0.5mm) usu- ally implies infarction (p119,
