recruitment of infl ammatory cells. Evidence showing platelet microthrombi in clubbed fi ngers, and high levels of PDGF and VEGF in patients with hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, support the theory. This does not explain the changes in patients with unilateral clubbing, usually seen in neurological disorders. Causes Thoracic: GI: Cardiovascular: • Bronchial cancer (clubbing is • Infl ammatory bowel dis-• Cyanotic twice as common in women); ease (especially Crohn’s) cong enital heart usu ally not small cell cancer • Cirrhosis disease • Chronic lung suppuration: • GI lymphoma • Endocarditis • Empyema, abscess • Malabsorption, eg coeliac.• Atrial myxoma • Bronchiectasis • Aneurysms • Cystic fi brosis • Infected grafts. • Fibrosing alveolitis Rare: • Mesothelioma • Familial • TB. • Thyroid acropachy (p562). Unilateral clubbing: • Hemiplegia • Vascular lesions, eg upper-limb artery aneurysm, Takayasu’s arteritis, brachial arteriovenous malformations (including iatrogenic— haemodialysis fi stulas).
