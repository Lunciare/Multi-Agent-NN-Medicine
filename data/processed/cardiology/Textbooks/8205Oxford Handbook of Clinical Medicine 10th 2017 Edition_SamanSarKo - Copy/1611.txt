ings can help identify peritoneal metastases. Treatment See p622 for a description of surgical resections. Early gastric cancers may be resectable endoscopically (endoscopic mucosal resection). Partial gastrec- tomy may suffi ce for more advanced distal tumours. If proximal, total gast rectomy may be needed. Combination chemotherapy (eg epirubicin, cisplatin and fl uorouracil) appears to increase survival in advanced disease. If given perioperatively in operable disease it improves survival compared to surgery alone. Surgical palliation is often needed for obstruction, pain, or haemorrhage. In locally advanced and metastatic disease, chemotherapy increases quality of life and survival. Targeted therapies are likely to have an increasing role, eg trastuzumab for HER-2-positive tumours. 5yr survival <10% overall, but nearly 20% for patients undergoing radical surgery. The prognosis is much better for ‘early’ gastric carcinoma. Bile duct and gallbladder cancers All are rare, have an overall poor prognosis, and are diffi cult to diagnose. They ac- count for ~3% of all GI cancers worldwide, but there is geographical variation ( in north-east Thailand, Japan, Korea, and Eastern Europe). Most are adenocarcino- mas. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (p282) is the commonest predisposing factor in the West. Presentation: Varies according to location and may include obstructive jaundice, pruritus,
