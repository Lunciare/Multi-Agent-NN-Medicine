BP rises and bleeding starts. Replace blood and re-explore wound. Secondary haemorrhage (caused by infection) occurs 1–2wks post-op. Talking about post-op complications… When asked to give your thoughts on the complications of an operation—maybe with an examiner or a patient—a good starting point is to divide them up accord- ingly (and for each of the following stratify as immediate, early, and late): • From the anaesthetic: (p572.) Eg respiratory depression from induction agents. • From surgery in general: (p576.) Eg wound infection, haemorrhage, neurovas- cular damage, DVT/PE. • From the specifi c procedure: Eg saphenous nerve damage in stripping of the long varicose vein. Tailor the discussion towards the individual who, eg if an arteriopath, may have a signifi cant risk of cardiac ischaemia during hypotensive episodes while under the anaesthetic. For some other post-op complications, see: • Pain (p574) • DVT (p578) • Pulmonary embolus (p190; massive, p818) • Wound de- hiscence (p580) • Complications in post-gastric surgery (p622) • Other complica- tions of specifi c operations (p580). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 557777 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 578 Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) DVTS occur in 25–50% of surgical patients, and many non-surgical patients. All hospi- tal inpatients should be assessed for DVT/PE risk
