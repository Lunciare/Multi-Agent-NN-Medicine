Complications of RRT Annual mortality is signifi cant, mostly due to cardiovascu- lar disease: BP, calcium/phosphate dysregulation, vascular stiff ness, infl ammation, oxidative stress, abnormal endothelial function. Protein-calorie malnutrition: In- creases morbidity and mortality. Renal bone disease: High bone turnover, renal osteodystrophy, osteitis fi brosa. Infection: Uraemia causes granulocyte and T-cell dysfunction with sepsis-related mortality. Amyloid: 2-microglobulin accumulates in long–term dialysis causing carpal tunnel syndrome, arthralgia, visceral eff ects. Conservative management is for those who opt not to receive RRT due to lack of benefi t on quality or quantity of life. Focus is on preserving residual renal function, symptom control, and advanced planning with patient and family for end-of-life care. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 330066 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 enicidem laneR When a patient on dialysis presents... 307 1 Do they need
