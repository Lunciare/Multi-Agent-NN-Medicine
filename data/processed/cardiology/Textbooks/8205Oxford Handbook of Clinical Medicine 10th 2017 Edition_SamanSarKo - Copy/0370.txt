people—BP is on average lower in young people (eg 100–110/60–70 in 18-year- olds) and they have a ‘lifetime’ of risk ahead of them; but evidence to treat is lacking. White-coat hypertension Refers to an elevated clinic pressure, but normal ABPM (day average <135/85). NICE says don’t treat; but more likely to develop hypertension in future, and may have risk of CVD. Masked hypertension is the opposite. ‘Malignant’ or accelerated phase hypertension: A rapid rise in BP leading to vas- cular damage (pathological hallmark is fi brinoid necrosis). Usually there is severe hypertension (eg systolic >200, diastolic>130mmHg) + bilateral retinal haemorrhages and exudates; papilloedema may or may not be present. Symptoms are common, eg headache ± visual disturbance. It requires urgent treatment, and may also pre- cipitate acute kidney injury, heart failure, or encephalopathy, which are hypertensive emergencies. Untreated, 90% die in 1yr; treated, 70% survive 5yrs. It is more com- mon in younger and in black subjects. Look hard for any underlying cause. Primary or ‘essential’ hypertension: (Cause unknown.) ~95% of cases. Secondary hypertension: ~5% of cases. Causes include: • Renal disease: the most common secondary cause. 75% are from intrinsic renal disease: glomerulonephritis, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), systemic sclerosis, chronic
