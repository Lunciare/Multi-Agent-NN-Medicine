a single sound, a summation gallop. An ejection systolic click is heard early in systole with bicuspid aortic valves, and if BP. The right heart equivalent lesions may also cause clicks. Mid-systolic clicks occur in mitral valve prolapse (p144). An opening snap precedes the mid-diastolic murmur of mitral (and tricuspid) steno- sis. It indicates a pliable (non-calcifi ed) valve. Prosthetic sounds are caused by non-biological valves, on opening and closing: rum- bling sounds ≈ ball and cage valves (eg Starr–Edwards); single clicks ≈ tilting disc valve (eg single disc: Bjork Shiley; bileafl et: St Jude—often quieter). Prosthetic mitral valve clicks occur in time with S1, aortic valve clicks in time with S2. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 4444 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 noitanimaxe dna yrotsiH 45 Fig 2.13 The cardiac cycle. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 4455 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 noitanimaxe dna yrotsiH 46 Cardiac murmurs Always consider other symptoms and signs before auscultation and think: ‘What do I expect to hear?’ But don’t let your expectations determine what you hear. Use the stethoscope correctly: remember that the bell is good for low-pitched sounds (eg mitral stenosis) and should be applied gently. The diaphragm fi lters out low pitches, making higher-pitched murmurs easier to detect (eg aortic regurgita- tion). NB: a
