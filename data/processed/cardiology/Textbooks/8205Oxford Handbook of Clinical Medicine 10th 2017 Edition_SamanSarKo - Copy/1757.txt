(monitor weekly), Ca2+, K+, and PO43Ω. Treatment: If needed, give magnesium salts, PO or IV (eg 8mmol MgSO4 IV over 3min to 2h, depending on severity, with frequent Mg2+ levels). Hypermagnesaemia Rarely requires treatment unless severe (>7.5mmol/L). Causes: Renal failure or iatrogenic (eg excessive antacids). Signs: If severe: neuro- muscular depression, BP, pulse, hypor efl exia, CNS & respiratory depression, coma. Zinc Zinc defi ciency This may occur in parenteral nutrition or, rarely, from a poor diet (too few cereals and dairy products; anorexia nervosa; alcoholism). Rarely it is due to a genetic defect. Symptoms: Alopecia, dermatitis (look for red, crusted skin le- sions especially around nostrils and corners of mouth), night blindness, diarrhoea. Diagnosis: Therapeutic trial of zinc (plasma levels are unreliable as they may be low, eg in infection or trauma, without defi ciency). Selenium An essential element present in cereals, nuts, and meat. Low soil levels in some parts of Europe and China cause defi ciency states. Required for the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase, which  harmful free radicals. Selenium is also antithrom- bogenic, and is required for sperm motility proteins. Defi ciency may increase risk of neoplasia and atheroma, and may lead to a cardiomyopathy or arthritis.
