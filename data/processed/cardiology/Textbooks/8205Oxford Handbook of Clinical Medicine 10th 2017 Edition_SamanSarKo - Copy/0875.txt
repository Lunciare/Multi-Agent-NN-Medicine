by Prussian blue staining ~1 week after onset (implying a chronic intravascular haemolysis). 4 Why is there haemolysis? Causes are on p338. History Family history, race, jaundice, dark urine, drugs, previous anaemia, travel. Examination Jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, gallstones (pigmented, due to bili- rubin from haemolysis), leg ulcers (due to poor blood fl ow). Tests FBC, reticulocytes, bilirubin, LDH, haptoglobin, urinary urobilinogen. Thick and thin fi lms for malaria screen if history of travel. The blood fi lm may show poly- chromasia and macrocytosis due to reticulocytes, or point to the diagnosis: • Hypochromic microcytic anaemia (thalassaemia). • Sickle cells (sickle-cell anaemia). • Schistocytes (fi g 8.30, p339; microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia). • Abnormal cells in haematological malignancy. • Spherocytes (hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune haemolytic anaemia). • Elliptocytes (fi g 8.36, p339; hereditary elliptocytosis). • Heinz bodies, ‘bite’ cells (fi g 8.32, p339; glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase defi ciency). Further tests (if the cause is still not obvious) • Osmotic fragility testing will confi rm the presence of membrane abnormalities which have been identifi ed on the fi lm. • Hb electrophoresis will detect haemoglobinopathies. • The direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT, fi g 8.28) identifi es red cells coated with antibody or complement, the
