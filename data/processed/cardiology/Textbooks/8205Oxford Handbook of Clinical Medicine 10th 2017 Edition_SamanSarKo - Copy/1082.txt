The rupture of schizonts Fig 9.27 Malaria lifecycle. releases merozoites which enter RBCs (‘what a fantastic niche!’). In the RBC, merozoites form larger trophozoites and erthrocytic schizonts (poor prognostic indicator if seen on blood fi lm). The rupture of erthrocytic schizonts produces the clinical manifestations of malaria. Clinical features Consider in anyone with a fever who has previously visited a malarial area (fi g 9.23), regardless of prophylaxis. Presentation: P. falciparum has a minimum incubation of 6 days and most com- monly occurs within 3 months of return from an endemic area. Take a careful travel history: country, area of travel, date of return. Do not forget to ask about stopovers. Symptoms are non-specifi c: fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, diarrhoea, cough. Fe- ver patterns are described but only occur if rupture of infected RBCs is synchronized: alternate day for P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale (‘tertian’); every 3rd day for P. malariae (‘quartan’). Most patients have no specifi c fever pattern. Examination: Fever, otherwise unremarkable. If diagnosis is delayed or severe dis- ease then may present
