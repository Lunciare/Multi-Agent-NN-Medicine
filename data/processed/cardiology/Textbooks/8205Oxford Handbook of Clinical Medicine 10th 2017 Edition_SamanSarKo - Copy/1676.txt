Is asymptomatic non-visible haematuria signifi cant? Dipstick tests are often done routinely for patients on admission. If non-visible (previously microscopic) haematuria is found, but the patient has no related symptoms, what does this mean? Before rushing into a barrage of investigations, consider: • One study found that incidence of urogenital disease (eg bladder cancer) was no higher in those with asymptomatic microhaematuria than in those without. • Asymptomatic non-visible haematuria is the sole presenting feature in only 4% of bladder cancers, and there is no evidence that these are less advanced than malignancies presenting with macroscopic haematuria. • When monitoring those with treated bladder cancer for recurrence, non-visible- haematuria tests have a sensitivity of only 31% in those with superfi cial bladder malignancy, in whom detection would be most useful. • Although 80% of those with fl ank pain due to a renal stone have microscopic haematuria, so do 50% of those with fl ank pain but no stone. The conclusion is not that urine dipstick testing is useless, but that results should not be interpreted in isolation. Unexplained non-visible haematuria in those >50yrs should be referred under the 2-week rule.
