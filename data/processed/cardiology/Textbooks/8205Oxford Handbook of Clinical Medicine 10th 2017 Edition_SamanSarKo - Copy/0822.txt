Unclear benefi t once on dialysis: do not initiate but do not need to discontinue if tolerated. Lupus nephritis SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease with antibodies against nuclear components, eg double-stranded (ds)DNA. Deposition of antibody complexes causes infl ammation and tissue damage. Presentation: Rash, photosensitivity, ulcers, arthritis, serositis, CNS eff ects, cytopenias, and renal disease. Nephropathy is common (50% in fi rst year, 75% overall). Can present as nephritis (p310) or nephrosis (p312). Diagnosis: Clinical. Antibody profi le: ANA is sensitive but not specifi c. Anti-dsDNA has a specifi city of 75– 100% and titres correlate with disease activity. Consider biopsy if A:CR >30, P:CR >50. Treatment: Depends on histological class. Classes I and II show mild changes with little risk of renal disease progression: ACE-i/ARB for renal protection and hydroxy- chloroquine for extra-renal disease. Classes III-V require immunosuppression: my- cophenolate, glucocorticoids, cyclophosphamide, rituximab. Small vessel vasculitis Multiple classifi cation systems exist. Clinical phenotype and ANCA subtype are im- portant. ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) occurs with or without specifi city for
