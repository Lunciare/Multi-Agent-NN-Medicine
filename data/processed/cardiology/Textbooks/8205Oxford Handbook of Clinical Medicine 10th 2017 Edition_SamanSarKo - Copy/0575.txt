 CT/MRI adrenal glands. If no mass, proceed to adrenal vein sampling. If ACTH is detectable, dis- tinguish a pituitary cause from ectopic ACTH production by high-dose suppression test or corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) test: 100mcg ovine or human CRH IV. Measure cortisol at 120min. Cortisol rises with pituitary disease but not with ectopic ACTH production. If tests indicate that cortisol responds to manipulation, Cushing’s disease is likely. Image the pituitary (MRI) and consider bilateral inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling. If tests indicate that cortisol does not respond to manipulation, hunt for the source of ectopic ACTH—eg IV contrast CT of chest, abdomen, and pelvis ± MRI of neck, thorax, and abdomen, eg for small ACTH secreting carcinoid tumours. Fig 5.20 Hypercortisolism weakens skin; even normal stretching (or the pressure of obesity, as here) can make its elastin break— on healing we see these depressed purple scars (striae). Cortisone or rapid growth con- tributes to striae in other contexts: pregnan- cy, adolescence, weight lifting, sudden-onset obesity, or from strong steroid creams. Striae mature into silvery crescents looking like the underside of willow leaves. Unsightly imma- ture striae may be improved by YAG lasers. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 222255 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE 226 Addison’s disease
