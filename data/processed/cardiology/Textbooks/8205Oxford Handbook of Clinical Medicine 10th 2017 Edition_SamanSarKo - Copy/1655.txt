anomaly of the kidney mostly seen in adult females, where there is dilatation of the collecting ducts, which if severe leads to a sponge-like appearance of the renal medulla. Complications/associations: UTIs, nephrolithiasis, haematuria and hyper- calciuria, hyperparathyroidism (if present, look for genetic markers of MEN type 2A, see p223). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 663399 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS 640 Urinary tract obstruction Urinary tract obstruction is common and should be considered in any patient with impaired renal function. Damage can be permanent if the obstruction is not treated promptly. Obstruction may occur anywhere from the renal calyces to the urethral meatus, and may be partial or complete, unilateral or bilateral. Obstruct- ing lesions are luminal (stones, blood clot, sloughed papilla, tumour: renal, ureteric, or bladder), mural (eg congenital or acquired stricture, neuromuscular dysfunction, schistosomiasis), or extra-mural (abdom inal or pelvic mass/tumour, retroperitoneal fi brosis, or iatrogenic—eg post surgery). Unilateral obstruction may be clinically silent (normal urine output and U&E) if the other kidney is functioning. Bilateral obstruction or obstruction with infection requires urgent treatment. See p641. Clinical features • Acute upper tract obstruction: Loin pain radiating to the groin. There may be superimposed infection ± loin tenderness, or an enlarged kidney. • Chronic upper
