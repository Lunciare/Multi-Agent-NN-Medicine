eg via ectopic GH-releasing hormone from a carcinoid tumour. :≈1:1. Incidence: UK 3/million/yr. ~5% are associated with MEN-1 (p223). GH stimulates bone and soft tissue growth through secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Symptoms Acroparaesthesia (akron=extremities); amenor- rhoea; libido; headache; sweating; snoring; arthralgia; backache; fi g 5.28: ‘My rings don’t fi t, nor my old shoes, and now I’ve got a wonky bite (malocclusion) and curly hair. I put on lots of weight, all muscle and looked good for a while; now I look so haggard’. Signs (BOX ‘Signs of acromegaly’.) Often predate diagnosis by >4yrs. If acromegaly occurs before bony epiphyses fuse (rare), gigantism occurs. Complications (May present with CCF or ketoacidosis.) • Impaired glucose tolerance (~40%), DM (~15%). • Vascular: BP, left ventricular hypertrophy (±dilatation/CCF), cardiomyopathy, arrhy thmias. There is risk of ischaemic heart disease and stroke (?due to BP ± insulin resistance and GH-in- duced increase in fi brinogen and decrease in protein S). • Neoplasia: colon cancer risk; colonoscopy may be needed.21 Acromegaly in pregnancy (Subfertility is common.) Pregnancy may be normal; signs and chemistry may remit. Monitor glucose. Tests Glucose, Ca2+, and PO43Ω. GH: Don’t rely on random GH as secreti on is pulsatile and
