recent None, or dark red Blood in haemorrhage spot upper GI tract; on endoscopy adherent clot; visible vessel Initial Rockall score is based on pre-endoscopy criteria; these are added to post- endoscopy criteria for fi nal score which predicts risk of rebleeding and death (ta- ble 6.7). The Glas gow Blatchford score (GBS) is used pre-endoscopy to identify patients at low risk of requiring intervention. If GBS ≈ 0, admission can be avoid- ed—ie Hb 130g/L (or 120g/L if ); systolic BP 110mmHg; pulse <100/min; urea <6.5mmol/L; no melaena or syncope + no past/present liver disease or heart failure.

Achieve endoscopic haemostasis (2 of: clips, cautery, adrenaline). Admit to monitored bed; start PPI (eg omeprazole 40mg/12h IV/PO; meta-analyses show 72h IVI eg omepra- zole 80mg bolus then 8mg/h not superior). If haemodynamically stable start oral intake of clear
