For supportive/symptomatic treatment: Excess saliva: Advise on positioning, oral care, and suctioning. Try an antimuscarinic (eg propantheline) or glycopyrronium bromide (can be given SC). Botulinum toxin A may help. Dysphagia: Blend food. Gastrostomy is an option—discuss early on. Spasticity: Exercise, orthot- ics. See MS for drugs (p496). Communication diffi culty: Provide ‘augmentative and alternative’ communication equipment. End-of-life care: Involve palliative care team from diagnosis (p532). Consider opioids to relieve breathlessness and discuss non-invasive ventilation (see BOX ‘Dignity and Dignitas’). 14 If no UMN signs and distal arm muscles are aff ected in the distribution of individual nerves, suspect multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction block (diagnose on nerve conduction studies; : IV Ig). Gyn aeco mastia, atrophic testes ± infertility suggests Kennedy syndrome (bulbospinal muscular atrophy). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 550066 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN Bulbar and corticobulbar (‘pseudobulbar’) palsy 507 Bulbar palsy denotes diseases of the nuclei of cranial nerves IX–XII in the medulla.
