disease, MRCP is the imaging modality of choice for detection of common bile duct stones that can be missed on US. MRI performed after fl uid loading of the small bowel (fl uid delivered orally=MRI enterography; fl uid delivered via nasodu- odenal tube=MRI enteroclysis) permits assessment of small bowel infl ammation (eg Crohn’s) and lesions that can be challenging to reach with conventional endoscopy. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP; fi g 16.33) Indica- tions: No longer routinely used for diagnosis, it still has a signifi cant therapeutic role: sphincterotomy for common bile duct stones; stenting of benign or malignant strictures and obtaining brushings to diagnose the nature of a stricture. Method: A catheter is advanced from a side-viewing duodenoscope via the ampulla into the common bile duct. Contrast medium is injected and images taken to show lesions in the biliary tree and pancreatic ducts. Complications: Pancreatitis; bleeding; cholan- gitis; perforation. Mortality <0.2% overall; 0.4% if performing stone removal. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS; see p736.) Commonly used in diagnosis of upper GI abnormalities, and is excellent for diagnosis of oesophageal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers. It allows staging by assessing depth of invasion, as well as histological diagnosis by biopsy of lesions. Contrast studies
