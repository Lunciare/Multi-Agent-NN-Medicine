I can truly say that I am living a wretched life...in my profession it is a frightful state.’ However, despite becoming profoundly deaf by the age of 44, he continued to compose and perform throughout his auditory decline. As deafness crept into the ears of the French composer, Gabriel Fauré (1845–1924), he composed less, but only after los- ing his hearing did he manage to overcome his previous fear of writing a string quartert, telling his wife ‘This is a genre which Beethoven in particular made fa- mous, and causes all those who are not Beethoven to be terrifi ed of it’.
