lights/TV)? Triggered attacks tend to recur. Establish the type of seizure: See BOX ‘Seizure classifi cation’.7 NB: if a seizure be- gins with focal features, it is a partial seizure, however rapidly it then generalizes. Don’t forget non-epileptic attack disorder ( = ‘pseudo’ seizures—psychogenic): this is not uncommon. (Suspect if seizures have a gradual onset, prolonged duration, and abrupt termination and are accompanied by closed eyes ± resistance to eye opening, rapid breathing, fl uctuating motor activity, and episodes of motionless unrespon- siveness. CNS exam, CT, MRI, and EEG are normal. It may coexist with true epilepsy.) Rule out provoking causes: Most people would have a seizure given suffi cient prov- ocation (eg refl ex anoxic seizures in faints) but would not be classed as epileptic: only 3–10% of provoked seizures recur; generally when the provocation is irreversible. Causes: trauma; stroke; haemorrhage; ICP; alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal; metabolic disturbance (hypoxia, Na+ , Ca2+, glucose, uraemia, liver disease); in- fection (eg meningitis, encephalitis); T°; drugs (tricyclics, cocaine). Unprovoked seizures have a recur rence rate of 30–50%. Investigations Look for provoking causes. Consider an EEG: it cannot exclude epi- lepsy and can be falsely +ve, so don’t do one if simple syncope
