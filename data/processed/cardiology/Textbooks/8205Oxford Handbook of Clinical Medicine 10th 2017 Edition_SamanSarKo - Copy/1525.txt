can mask malnutrition. Evidence of malnutrition: skin hanging off muscles (eg over biceps); no fat between fold of skin; hair rough and wiry; pressure sores; sores at corner of mouth. Calculate body mass index (p244); BMI <18.5kg/m2 suggests malnouri shment. Anthropomorphic indices, eg mid-arm circumference, skin fold measures, and grip strength are also used. • Investigations: Generally unhelpful. Low albumin suggestive, but is aff ected by many things other than nutrition. Albumin can be helpful in monitoring recovery. Enteral nutrition (Ie nutrition given into gastrointestinal tract.) If at all possible, give nutrition by mouth. An all-fl uid diet can meet requirements (but get advice from dietician). If danger of choking or aspiration (eg after stroke), consider semi-solid diet. Early post-op enteral nutrition has been shown to benefi t patients (eg after GI surgery) and may reduce complications. Tube feeding: Liquid nutrition via a tube: Nasogastric typically placed without guidance (p759); nasojejunal tubes require en- doscopic placement (used if gastric outlet obstruction, delayed gastric emptying, post-gastrectomy, or pancreatitis). Alternatively, gastric or jejunal tubes may be in- serted radiologically or surgically (ie gastrostomy/jejunostomy). Use for nutritionally complete, commercially prepared feeds. Close liaison with a dietician is essential. Polymeric feeds consist of undigested
