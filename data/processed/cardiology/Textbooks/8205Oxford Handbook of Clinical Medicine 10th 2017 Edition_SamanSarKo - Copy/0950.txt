• B12. • Marrow shows hypercellularity with erythroid hyperplasia. • Cytogenetics as re- quired to diff erentiate from CML. • Serum erythropoietin. • Raised red cell mass on 51Cr studies and splenomegaly, in the setting of a normal PaO2, is diagnostic. Treatment: Aim to keep HCT <0.45 to risk of thrombosis. In younger patients at low risk, this is done by venesection. If higher risk (age >60yrs, previous thrombo- sis), hydroxycarbamide (=hydroxyurea) is used. -interferon is preferred in women of childbearing age. Aspirin 75mg daily is also given. Prognosis: Variable, many remain well for years. Thrombosis and haemorrhage (due to defective platelets) are the main complications. Transition to myelofi brosis occurs in ~30% or acute leukaemia in ~5%. Monitor FBC every 3 months. Essential thrombocythaemia (fi g 8.67) A clonal proliferation of megakaryo- cytes leads to persistently platelets, often >1000 ≈ 109/L, with abnormal function, causing bleeding or arterial and venous thrombosis, and microvascular occlu- sion—headache, atypical chest pain, light-headedness, erythromelalgia. Exclude other causes of thrombocytosis (see BOX). Treatment: aspirin 75mg OD. Hydroxy- carbamide in high-risk patients. Myelofi brosis There is hyperplasia of megakaryocytes which produce platelet- derived growth factor, leading to intense marrow fi brosis and haematopoiesis in the
