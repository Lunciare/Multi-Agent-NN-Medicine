amenorrhoea, fertility, libido, os- teoporosis, breast atrophy, dyspareunia.  Erectile dysfunction, libido, muscle bulk, hypogonadism (hair, all over; small testes; ejaculate volume; spermatogenesis). •Thyroid: as for hypothyroidism (p220). •Corticotropin: as for adrenal insuffi ciency (p226). NB: no skin pigmentation as ACTH. •Prolactin: rare: absent lactation. 2 Causes: Eg pituitary tumour (p234), causing mass eff ect, or hormone secretion with secretion of other hormones—eg prolactinoma, acromegaly, rarely Cushing’s. Tests (The triple stimulation test is now rarely done.) • Basal tests: LH and FSH ( or ), testosterone or oestradiol (); TSH ( or ), T4 (); prolactin (may be , from loss of hypothalamic dopamine that normally inhibits its release), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1; —used as a measure of GH axis, p238), cortisol (). Also do U&E (Na+from dilution), Hb (normochromic, normocytic). • Dynamic tests: 1 Short Synacthen® test: (p226) to assess the adrenal axis. 2 Insulin tolerance test (ITT): done in specialist centres to assess the adrenal and GH axes. CI: epilepsy, heart disease, adrenal failure. Consult lab fi rst. It involves IV insu- lin to induce hypoglycaemia, causing stress to cortisol and GH secretion. It is done in the morning (water only taken from 22:00h the night before). Have
