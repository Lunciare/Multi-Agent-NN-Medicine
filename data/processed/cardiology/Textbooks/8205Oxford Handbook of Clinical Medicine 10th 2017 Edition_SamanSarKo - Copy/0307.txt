-blocker. They are used mainly in hypertension and angina. • The non-dihydropyridines—verapamil and diltiazem—also slow conduction at the AV and SA nodes and may be used to treat hypertension, angina, and dysrhythmias.  Don’t give non-dihydropyridines with -blockers (risk of severe bradycardia ± LVF). SES: Flushes, headache, ankle oedema (diuretic unresponsive), LV function, gingival hypertrophy. CI: Heart block. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 111144 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC Digoxin Blocks the Na+/K+ pump. It is used to slow the pulse in fast AF (p130; aim for 115 100). As it is a weak +ve inotrope, its role in heart failure in sinus rhythm may be best reserved if symptomatic despite optimal ACE-i therapy; 10 here there is little ben- efi t vis-à-vis mortality (but admissions for worsening CCF are  by ~25%).11 Elderly people are at risk of toxicity: use lower doses. Measure plasma levels >6h post-dose (p756). Typical dose: 500mcg stat PO, repeated after 12h, then 125mcg (if elderly) to 250mcg/d PO OD (62.5mcg/d is almost never enough). IV dose: 0.75–1mg in 0.9% NaCl over 2h. Toxicity risk if: K+, Mg2+, or Ca2+. t½ ≈ 36h. If on digoxin, use less energy in cardioversion (start at 5J). If on amiodarone, halve the dose
