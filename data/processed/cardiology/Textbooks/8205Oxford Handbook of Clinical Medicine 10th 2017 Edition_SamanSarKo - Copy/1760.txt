es- tablished, haemodialysis is required (in preference to peritoneal dialysis). There is no evidence for either preventing (see previous paragraph) or treating hyperuricaemic renal failure. Gout See p548. Urate renal stones Urate stones (fi g 14.8) comprise 5–10% of all renal stones and are radiolucent. Incidence: ~5–10% in temperate climates (double if confi rmed gout), 12 but up to 40% in hot, arid cli- mates. :≈4:1. But most urate stone formers have no detectable abnormalities in urate metabolism. Risk factors: Acidic or strongly concentrated urine; urinary excretion of urate; chronic diarrhoea; distal small bowel disease or resection (regional enteritis); ileostomy; obesity; diabetes mellitus; chemotherapy for myeloproliferative disorders; inadequate caloric or fl uid intake. Treatment: Hydration to increase urine volume (aim >2L/d). Unlike most other renal calculi, existing uric acid stones can often be dissolved with either systemic Fig 14.8 Urate stone. or topical alkalinizing agents. Potassium citrate or ©Dr G. Austin. potassium bicarbonate at a dose titrated to alkalinize the urine to a pH of 6–7 dis- solves some urate stones. If hyperuricosuria, consider dietary management ± al- lopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 668800 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC 681 __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 668811 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC 682 Metabolic bone diseases: osteoporosis
