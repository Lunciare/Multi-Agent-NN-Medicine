If the patient is malnourished then 75mg/kg can kill. Signs and symptoms None initially, or vomiting ± RUQ pain. Later: jaundice and encephalopathy from liver damage (the main danger) ± acute kidney injury (AKI). Management General measures: See p838. GI decontamination is recommended in those presenting <4h after overdose: give activated charcoal 1g/kg (max 50g). • Glucose, U&E, LFT, INR, ABG, FBC, HCO3Ω ; blood paracetamol level at 4h post-ingestion. • If <10–12h since overdose, not vomiting, and plasma paracetamol is above the line on the graph (see fi g 19.26), start acetylcysteine. • If >8–24h and suspicion of large overdose (>7.5g) err on the side of caution and start acetylcysteine, stopping it if level below treatment line and INR/ALT normal. • If ingestion time is unknown, or it is staggered, or presentation is >15h from inges- tion, treatment may still help. Get advice. Acetylcysteine is given by IVI: 150mg/kg in 5% glucose over 15–60min; then 50mg/ kg in 500mL
