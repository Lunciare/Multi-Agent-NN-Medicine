by about 75%. The pyloric valve at the bottom of the stomach is left intact so function and digestion are unaltered. The procedure is not reversible and may be a fi rst stage for progression to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or duodenal switch in very obese patients where a single-stage procedure would be technically diffi cult or unsafe. • Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: (fi g 13.42) Laparoscopic or open. A portion of the jeju- num is attached to a small stomach pouch to allow food to bypass the distal stom- ach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum. It can be performed laparoscopically and works by both restriction and malabsorption. Mean excess weight loss at 5 years is 62.8%. Current evidence demonstrates greater weight loss, greater resolution of comorbidities, and lower reoperation rates compared to LAGB. Complications: mi- cronutrient defi ciency (requires vitamin supplementation and lifelong follow-up/ blood tests), dumping syndrome, wound infection, hernias, malabsorption, diar- rhoea, and a mortality of <0.5% (at experienced centres). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 662266 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yregruS Oesophagus 627 Pouch Adjustable band Duodenum Subcutaneous access port Fig 13.40 Adjustable gastric band.
