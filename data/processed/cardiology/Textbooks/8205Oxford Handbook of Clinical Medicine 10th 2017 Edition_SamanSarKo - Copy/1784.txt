char- acterized by photosensitive blistering skin lesions and/or acute attacks. The former is prevalent in Afrikaners in South Africa. Porphobilinogen is high only during an attack, and other metabolites may be detected in faeces. Triggers of an acute attack: Include infection, starvation (including pre-operative ‘nil-by-mouth’), reproductive hormones (pregnancy, premenstrual), smoking, anaes- thesia, and cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (alcohol, and other drugs—see BOX). Features of an acute attack: • Gastrointestinal: abdominal pain, vomiting, constipation. • Neuropsychiatric: peripheral neuropathy (weakness, hypotonia, pain, numbness), seizures (often associated with severe Na+), psychosis (or other odd behaviour).4 • Cardiovascular: hypertension, tachycardia, shock (due to sympathetic overactivity). • Other: fever, Na+, K+, proteinuria, urinary porphobilinogens, discoloured urine. Rare but serious complications include bulbar and respiratory paralysis. Beware the ‘acute abdomen’ in acute intermittent porphyria: colic, vomiting, fever, and WCC—so mimicking an acute surgical abdomen. Anaesthesia could be disastrous. Treatment of an acute attack: • Remove precipitants (review medications; treat intercurrent illness/infection). • IV fl uids to correct electrolyte imbalance. • High carbohydrate intake (eg Hycal®) by NG tube, or IV if necessary. • IV haematin is 1st-line (inhibits production of porphyrinogen precursors). • Nausea controlled with prochlorperazine 12.5mg IM. • Sedate if necessary with chlorpromazine 50–100mg
