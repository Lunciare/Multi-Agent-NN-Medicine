If so, can you answer him, point for point? Beyond the ethical framework To force an ethical problem to fi t a framework may be inadequate, reduction- istic, and inconsistent.18 It is potentially biased towards Western culture, dis- counts the non-autonomous, and is vulnerable to poorly considered emphasis and error. ‘Doing’ ethics can become a check-list exercise where thinking is lost. But doctors are not moral philosophers. They are clinicians. A framework there- fore provides a starting point from which to work. It is the toe which tests the water of moral deliberation. Be aware of the cultural setting of your dilemma and consider carefully the weight of synthesis. Be prepared to wade deeper if needed. But acknowledge that moral wisdom may well be out of your depth. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 1144 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem tuoba gniknihT Psychiatry on medical and surgical wards 15 ‘Body and soul cannot be separated for purposes of treatment, for they are one and indivisible.
