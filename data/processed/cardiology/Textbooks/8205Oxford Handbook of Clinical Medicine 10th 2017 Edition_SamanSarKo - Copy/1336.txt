fora- men magnum stenosis ± medulla oblongata compression); masses (cysts, rheu- matoid pannus, encephalocoele, tumours). Less commonly, a syrinx may develop after myelitis, cord trauma, or rupture of an AV malformation, or within spinal tumours (ependymoma or haemangioblastoma) due to fl uid secreted from neo- plastic cells or haemorrhage. Signs Dissociated sensory loss (absent pain and T° sensation, with preserved light touch, vibration, and joint-position sense) due to pressure from the syrinx on the decussating antero lateral pathway (fi g 10.35) in a root dis tribution refl ect- ing the location of the syrinx (eg for typical cervical syrinx then sensory loss is over trunk and arms); wasting/weakness of hands ± claw-hand (then armssho- uldersrespirat ory muscles). Anterior horn cells are also vulnerable. Other signs: Horner’s syndrome (can be bilateral and therefore more diffi cult to spot); UMN leg signs; body asymm etry, limb hemi- hypert rophy, or unil at eral odo- or chiromegaly (enlarged hand or foot), perhaps from release of trophic fac- tors via anterior horn cells; Char- cot’s joints in the shoulder/wrist due to lost joint prop rio ception (see fi g 5.11, p213).
