and T-wave inver- sion. If you record V7–V9 leads, you may fi nd the classic ST elevation pattern and so confi rm posterior MI. See fi g 3.24. The ‘upside-down’ changes seen in posterior MI are called ‘reciprocal changes’: changes that appear when ‘looking’ at ischaemic myocardium from the other side of the heart. These can arise with MIs in other locations (fi g 3.9). They are particu- larly important in posterior MI as they may be the only changes on the 12-lead ECG. See fi g 3.9, 3.10, 3.24 for example ECGs. See fi g 3.18 for coronary artery anatomy. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 9999 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 100 ECG—ad ditional points Where to place the chest leads (See fi g 3.6.) V1 : Right sternal edge, 4th intercostal space. V2 : Left sternal edge, 4th intercostal space. V3 : Half-way between V2 and V4. V4 : 5th intercostal space, mid-clavicular line; all subsequent leads are in the same horizontal plane as V4. V5 : Anterior axillary line. V6 : Mid-axillary line (V7: posterior axillary line). Good skin preparation (clean with non-alcoholic wipe, shave if hairy, etc.) will improve ECG qual- ity. Finish 12-lead ECGs with a long rhythm strip in
