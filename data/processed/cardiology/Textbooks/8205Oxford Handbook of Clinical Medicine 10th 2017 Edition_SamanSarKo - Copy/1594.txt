linea semilunaris at the lateral edge of the rectus sheath, below and lateral to the umbilicus. Lumbar hernias occur through the inferior or superior lumbar triangles in the pos- terior abdominal wall. Richter’s hernias involve bowel wall only—not the whole lumen. Maydl’s hernias involve a herniating ‘double loop’ of bowel. The strangulated por- tion may reside as a single loop inside the abdominal cavity. Littré’s hernias are hernial sacs containing strangulated Meckel’s diverticulum. Obturator hernias occur through the obturator canal. Typically there is pain along the medial side of the thigh in a thin woman. Sciatic hernias pass through the lesser sciatic foramen (a way through var ious pelvic ligaments). GI obstruction + a gluteal mass suggests this rare possibility. Sliding hernias contain a partially extraperitoneal structure (eg caecum on the right, sigmoid colon on the left). The sac does not completely surround the contents. Paediatric hernias include Umbilical hernias: (3% of live births). Are a result of a persistent defect in the transversalis fascia. Surgical repair rarely needed as most resolve by the age of 3. Indirect inguinal hernias (~ 4% of all  infants due to patent processus vaginalis—prematurity is a risk factor; uncommon in  infants—consider testicular
