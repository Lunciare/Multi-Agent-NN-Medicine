Handbook of Clinical medicine

Thrombophilia is an inherited or acquired coagulopathy that predisposes to throm- bosis, usually venous: DVT or PE (venous thromboembolism: VTE). Special precautions are needed when there is an additional risk factor for thrombosis, eg surgery, preg- nancy, or enforced rest (see BOX for other risk factors). Only ~50% of patients with thrombosis and a +ve family history have an identifi able thrombophilia on routine tests: others may have abnormalities that are as yet unidentifi ed. Inherited • Activated protein c (APC) resistance/factor V Leiden: Chief cause of in- herited thrombophilia. Present in ~5% of the population, although most will not de- velop thrombosis. Usually associated with a single point mutation in factor V (factor V Leiden), so that this clotting factor is not broken down by APC. Risk of DVT or PE is raised 5-fold if heterozygous for the mutation (50-fold if homozygous). Thrombotic risk is increased in pregnancy and those on oestrogens (OHCS p33, p257 & p303). • Prothrombin gene mutation: Causes high prothrombin levels and thrombosis due to down-regulation of fi brinolysis, by thrombin-activated fi brinolysis inhibitor. • Protein C & S defi ciency: These vitamin K-dependent factors act together to cleave and so neutralize factors V &
