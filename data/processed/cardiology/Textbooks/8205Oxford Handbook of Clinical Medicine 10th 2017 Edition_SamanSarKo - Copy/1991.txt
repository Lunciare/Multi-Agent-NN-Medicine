The compressible vein is above the artery. apply pressure and attempt a second puncture. • If the wire threads easily, insert to 30cm (see markings on the wire), remove the needle keeping hold of the wire at all times. Make a nick in the skin with a scalpel at the insertion point, and gently thread the dilator over the wire. You do not need to insert the dilator far, only as far as the vein (you often feel a loss of resistance as the dilator enters the vein, so insert gently: a pneumothorax can result from enthusiastic dilating). • Remove the dilator, keeping hold of the wire, thread the fl ushed catheter over the wire, then remove the wire. The line should sit at about 13cm on the right side (17cm on the left). Check you can aspirate blood from each lumen, then fl ush them. • Suture the catheter in place (many have little ‘wings’ for suturing) and dress. Re- quest a CXR to confi rm position and exclude pneumothorax. The tip of the catheter should sit vertically in the SVC. Femoral
