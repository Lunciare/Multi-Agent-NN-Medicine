Do not do the test before establishing that urine volume is >3L/d (output less than this with normal plasma Na+ and osmolality excludes signifi cant disturbance of water balance). • Stop test if urine osmolality >600mOsmol/kg in Stage 1 (DI is excluded). • Free fl uids until 07.30. Light breakfast at 06.30, no tea, no coff ee, no smoking. Stage 1 Fluid deprivation (0–8h): for diagnosis of DI. Start at 08.00. • Empty bladder, then no drinks and only dry food. • Weigh hourly. If >3% weight lost during test, order urgent serum osmolality. If >300mOsmol/kg, proceed to Stage 2. If <300, continue test. • Collect urine every 2h; measure its volume and osmolality. • Venous sample for osmolality every 4h. • Stop test after 8h (16.00) if urine osmolality
