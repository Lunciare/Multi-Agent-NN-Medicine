knock- kneed, bow-legged, and deformities of the metaphyseal–epiphyseal junction (eg the rachitic rosary). Features of Ca2+—often mild (p678). Children with rickets are ill. Osteomalacia: Bone pain and tenderness; fractures (esp. femoral neck); proximal myopathy (waddling gait), due to PO43Ω and vitamin D defi ciency per se. Causes Vitamin D defi ciency: Due to malabsorption (p266), poor diet, or lack of sunlight. Renal osteodystrophy: Renal failure leads to 1,25-dihydroxy-cholecalciferol defi cien- cy [1,25(OH)2-vitamin D defi ciency]. See also renal bone disease (p312). Drug-induced: Anticonvulsants may induce liver enzymes, leading to an increased breakdown of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D. Vitamin D resistance: A number of mainly inherited conditions in which the os- teomalacia responds to high doses of vitamin D (see ‘Treatment’ later in this topic). Liver disease: Due to reduced hydroxylation of vitamin D to 25-hydroxy-cholecalcif- erol and malabsorption of vitamin D, eg in cirrhosis (p276). Tumour-induced osteomalacia: (Oncogenic hypophosphataemia.) Mediated by raised tumour production of phosphato nin fi broblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) which causes hyperphosphaturia. serum PO43Ω often causes myalgia and weakness.18 Investigations Plasma: Mildly Ca2+ (but may be severe); PO43Ω; ALP; PTH high; 25(OH)-vitamin D, except in vitamin D resistance. In renal failure, 1,25(OH)2-vitamin D (p312). Biopsy: Bone biopsy shows
