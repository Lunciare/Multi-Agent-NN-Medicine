predisposition to arrhythmias, concurrent digoxin therapy, or pre- existing K+-losing conditions. If refractory oedema, consider adding a thiazide, eg metolazone 5–20mg/24h PO. Diuretics improve symptoms but studies show- ing mortality benefi t are lacking. 2 ACE-i: Consider in all those with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD); improves symptoms and prolongs life (see p114–5). If cough is a problem, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may be substituted. SE: K+. 3 -blockers: (eg carvedilol) mortality in heart failure—benefi t additional to those of ACE-i in patients with systolic dysfunction. 38 Use with caution: ‘start low and go slow’; if in doubt seek specialist advice fi rst; wait ≥2weeks between each dose increment. -blocker therapy in patients hospitalized with decom- pensated heart failure is associated with lower post-discharge mortality risk and improved treatment rates. 39 4 Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: Spironolactone (25mg/24h PO) mortality by 30% when added to conventional therapy. 40 Use in those still symptomatic despite optimal therapy as listed previously, and in post-MI pa- tients with LVSD. Spironolactone is K+-sparing, but there is little risk of signifi - cant hyperkalaemia, even when given with ACE-i. Nevertheless, U&E should be monitored, particularly if the patient has known CKD. Eplerenone is an alterna-
