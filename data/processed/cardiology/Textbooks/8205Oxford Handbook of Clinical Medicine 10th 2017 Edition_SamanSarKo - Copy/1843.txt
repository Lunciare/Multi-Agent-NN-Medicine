The meningococcal en- dotoxin acts as a potent initiator of infl ammatory and coagulation cascades. Other causes include H. infl uenzae, pneumococcal, streptococcal, and staphylococcal sep- sis. Adrenal failure causes shock, as normal vascular tone requires cortisol to set activity of - and -adrenergic receptors, and aldosterone is needed to maintain extracellular fl uid volume. Treatment: Antibiotics, eg ceftriaxone (p822) and hy- drocortisone 200mg/4h IV for adrenal support. ICU admission. Rupert Waterhouse, 1873–1958 (British physician); Carl Friderichsen, 1886–1979 (Danish paediatrician) Weber’s syndrome (Superior alternating hemiplegia.) Ipsilateral oculomotor nerve palsy with contralateral hemiplegia, due to infarction of one-half of the mid- brain, after occlusion of the paramedian branches of the basilar or posterior cerebral arteries. Herman David Weber, 1823–1918 (German-born physician whose son described Sturge–Weber syndrome)
