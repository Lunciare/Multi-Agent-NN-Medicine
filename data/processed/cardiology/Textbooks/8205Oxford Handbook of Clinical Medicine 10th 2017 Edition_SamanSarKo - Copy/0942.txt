The role of rituximab in untreated follicular lymphoma Rituximab kills CD20 +ve cells by antibody-directed cytotoxicity ± apoptosis in- duction. It also sensitizes cells to CHOP. It is cost-eff ective when used with: • cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone (CVP) • cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) • cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide, prednisolone, and interferon alfa (CHVPi) • mitoxantrone, chlorambucil, and prednisolone (MCP) • chlorambucil. It also has a role in maintaining remission, and in relapsed disease. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 336633 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 364 Pancytopenia and bone marrow failure Bone marrow is responsible for
