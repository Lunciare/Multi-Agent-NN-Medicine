Other common joints are the ankle, foot, small joints of the hand, wrist, elbow, or knee. It can be polyarticular. It is caused by deposition of mono- sodium urate crystals in and near joints. Attacks may be precipitated by trauma, surgery, starvation, infection, or diuretics. It is associated with raised plasma urate. In the long term, urate deposits (= tophi, eg in pinna, tendons, joints; see fi g 12.9) and renal disease (stones, interstitial nephritis) may occur. Prevalence: ~1%.  :  ≈ 4 : 1.
