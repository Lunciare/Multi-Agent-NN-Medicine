The previously favoured theory of dilatation of cerebral and meningeal arteries has been largely disproven, so what is the cause? • MRI dur- ing attacks shows episodic cerebral oedema, dilatation of intrac erebral vessels, and  water diff usion not respecting vascular territories, so the primary event may be neurological. • PET suggests migraine is a subcortical disorder aff ecting the modulation of sensory processing • Magneto-encephalographic (MEG) stud- ies have shown resting (interictal) hyperexcitability at least in the visual cortex, suggesting a failure of inhibitory circuits. • Hormones play a role: the incidence of migraine in both pre-pubertal and post-menopausal women is equal to men, yet increases to 3:1 during reproductive years, with 50% of females reporting syn- chrony of migraines with the menstrual cycle. • Elevated levels of 5-HT metabo- lites in the urine of patients during migraine attacks was fi rst
