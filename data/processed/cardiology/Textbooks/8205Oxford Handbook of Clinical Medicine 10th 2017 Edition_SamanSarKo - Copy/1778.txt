for hyperlipidaemia NB: full screening requires a fasting lipid profi le. Those at risk of hyperlipidaemia: •Family history of hyperlipidaemia. •Corneal ar- cus <50yrs old. •Xanthomata or xanthelasmata (fi g 14.13). Those at risk of CVD: •Known CVD. •Family history of CVD <60yrs old. •DM or impaired glucose tolerance. •Hypertension. •Smoker. •BMI. •Low socioeconomic or Indian Asian background. Types of hyperlipidaemia Common primary hyperlipidaemia: Accounts for 70% of hyperlipidaemia. LDL only. Familial primary hyperlipidaemias: Multiple phenotypes exist (see table 14.8). Risk of CVD, although evidence suggests protection from CVD is achieved with lower doses of statin than for common primary hyperlipidaemia. 26 Refer to specialist. Secondary hyperlipidaemia: Causes include: Cushing’s syndrome, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, or cholestasis. LDL. Treat the cause fi rst. Mixed hyperlipidaemia: Results in  in both LDL and triglycerides. Caused by type 2 diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, alcohol abuse, and chronic renal failure. Management Identify familial or 2° hyperlipidaemias, as  may diff er. Give lifestyle advice; aim for BMI of 20–25; encourage a Mediterranean-style diet—fruit, vegetables, fi sh, unsatu- rated fats; and red meat; exercise. Top  priority are those with known CVD (there is no need to calculate their risk: ipso facto they already have
