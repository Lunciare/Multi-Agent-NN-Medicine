on nerve fi bre size involved). Involvement of a single nerve (mononeuropathy) occurs with trauma or entrapment (carpal tunnel, p503); invol vement of several nerves (mononeuritis multiplex) is seen, eg in DM or vasculitis. Sensory loss from indi- vidual nerve lesions will follow anatomical territories (dermatomes, p454), which are usually more sharply defi ned than those of root lesions. Also ask What is the lesion? Are the cells diseased, dysfunctional, disconnected (after a stroke), or under- or overexcited (migraine; epilepsy)? Is there loss of a specifi c type of nerve cell, as in MND or subacute com bined degeneration of the cord (B12, p334). Arteriopaths get strokes, tropical travellers get wormy lesions. Why? Is there a systemic disease causing the neurology? Eg atrial fi brillation allowing an embolus to form, which then lodges in the patient’s dominant hemi- sphere, causing an infarct that presents with dysphasia. Do a full systems ex- amination and always beware the irregularly irregular pulse. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 444477 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 448 Drugs and the nervous system The brain is a gland that secretes both thoughts and molecules: both products are modulated by neurotransmitter systems.
