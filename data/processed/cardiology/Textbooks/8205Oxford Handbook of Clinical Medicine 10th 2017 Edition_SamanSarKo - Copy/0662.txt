culture. Today, ‘diffi cile’ might better refer to challenges of containment. Signs: T°; colic; diarrhoea with systemic upset—CRP, WCC, albumin, and colitis (with yellow adherent plaques on infl amed non-ulcerated mucosa—the pseudomembrane) progressing to toxic megacolon and multi-organ failure. Asymptomatic carriage: 2–5% of all adults. Only problematic with gut ecology disrupted by, eg antibiotics, leading to rapid proliferation and toxin expression. Predictors of fulminant C. diff colitis: >70yrs, past C. diff infection; use of anti- peristaltic drugs; severe leucocytosis; haemodynamic instability. Detection: Urgent testing of suspicious stool (characteristic smell—ask the nurses). Two-stage process with rapid screening test for C. diff protein (or PCR) followed by specifi c ELISA for toxins. AXR for toxic megacolon. : Stop causative antibiotic if possible. Mild disease: metronidazole 400mg/8h PO for 10–14d (vanco mycin 125mg/6h PO is better in severe disease). Intensive regimens of vancomycin 500mg/6h with IV and PR vancomycin may be needed for non-respond- ers. Urgent colectomy may be needed if toxic megacolon, LDH, or if deteriorating. Recurrent disease: Common (≈25%). Fidaxomicin, a minimally absorbed oral an- tibiotic, is associated with lower relapse rates. Faecal transplantation (introduction of a suspension prepared from the faeces of a screened donor via endoscopy or via NG/NJ
