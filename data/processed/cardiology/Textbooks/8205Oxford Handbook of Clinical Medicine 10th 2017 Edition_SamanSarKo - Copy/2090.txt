If fi ts continue … 3 SeekI CU help: Paralysis and anaesthesia with eg propofol is required. Close moni- toring, especially respiratory function, is vital. Consider whether this could be pseudoseizures (p490), particularly if there are odd features (pelvic thrusts; resist- ing attempts to open lids and your attempts to do passive movements; arms and legs fl ailing around). 4 Dexamethasone: 10mg IV if vasculitis/cerebral oedema (tumour) possible. As soon as seizures are controlled, start oral drugs (p492). Ask what the cause was, eg hypoglycaemia, pregnancy, alcohol, drugs, CNS lesion or infection, hypertensive encephalopathy, inadequate anticonvulsant dose/compliance (p490). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 882266 0022//0055//22001177
