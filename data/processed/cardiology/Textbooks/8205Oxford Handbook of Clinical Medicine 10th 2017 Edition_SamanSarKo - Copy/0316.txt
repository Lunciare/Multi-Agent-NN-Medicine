olaemia do not. Probable triggers include cocaine, amphetamine, marijuana, low magnesium, and artery instrumentation (eg during angiography). Treatment: Avoid triggers. Correct low magnesium. Stop smoking. PRN GTN. Cal- cium channel blockers ± long-acting nitrates. Avoid non-selective -blockers, aspi- rin, and triptans. Prognosis is usually very good. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 111177 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 118 Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) Defi nitions ACS includes unstable angina and myocardial infarctions (MIs). These share a common underlying pathology—plaque rupture, thrombosis, and infl amma- tion. However, ACS may rarely be due to emboli, coronary spasm, or vasculitis (p556) in normal coronary arteries. Myocardial infarction means there is myocardial cell death, releasing troponin. Ischaemia means a lack of blood supply, ±cell death. MIS have troponin rises, unstable angina does not. An MI may be a STEMI—ACS with ST- segment elevation (may only be present in V7–V9 if posterior STEMI) or new-onset LBBB; or an NSTEMI—trop-positive ACS without ST-segment elevation—the ECG may show ST depression, T-wave inversion, non-specifi c changes, or be normal. The de- gree of irreversible myocyte death varies, and signifi cant necrosis can occur without ST elevation. Risk factors Non-modifi able: age,  gender, family history of IHD (MI in 1st-degree relative <55yrs). Modifi able:
