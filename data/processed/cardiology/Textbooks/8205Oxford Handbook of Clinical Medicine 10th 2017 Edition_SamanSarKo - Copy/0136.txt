about other sounds and soft murmurs may be diffi cult. Even senior colleagues disagree with one another about the more diffi cult sounds and murmurs. The 1st heart sound (S1) Represents closure of mitral (M1) and tricuspid (T1) valves. Splitting in inspiration may be heard and is normal. • Loud SIn mitral stenosis, because the narrowed valve orifi ce limits ventricular 1 fi lling, there is no gradual decrease in fl ow towards the end of diastole. The valves are, therefore, at their maximum excursion at the end of diastole, and so shut rap- idly leading to a loud S1 (the ‘tapping’ apex). S1 is also loud if diastolic fi lling time is shortened, eg if the PR interval is short, and in tachycardia. • Soft S 1 occurs if the diastolic fi lling time is prolonged, eg prolonged PR interval, or if the mitral valve leafl ets fail to close properly (ie mitral incompetence). The intensity of S1 is variable in AV block, AF, and nodal or ventricular tachycardia. The 2nd heart sound (S2) Represents aortic (A2) and pulmonary valve (P2) closure. The most important abnormality of A2 is softening in aortic stenosis. • A is said to be
