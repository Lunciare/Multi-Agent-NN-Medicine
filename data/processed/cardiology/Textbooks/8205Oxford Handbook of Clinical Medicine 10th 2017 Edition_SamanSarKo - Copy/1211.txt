tinnitus fully to exclude an acoustic neuroma (p462). Causes Inner ear damage and hearing loss (leading to auditory cortex hyper-excit- ability), wax, excess noise, head injury, otitis media, post-stapedectomy, Ménière’s, anaemia (if pulsatile then think of carotid artery stenosis or dissection, AV fi stulae, and glomus jugulare tumours). Drugs: Aspirin (reversible), loop diur etics, aminogly- cosides. Mean age at onset: 40–50yrs. :≈1:1. Management Exclude serious causes. Psychological support is very important: reassure that tinnitus does not mean madness or serious disease and that it often improves in time. Cognitive therapy helps, as do ‘tinnitus coping training’ and pa- tient support groups. Drugs are disappointing: anticonvulsants (eg carbamazepine) are not of benefi t; misoprostol appears to help (small-scale trials only); hypnotics at night may be of some benefi t. Avoid tranquillizers, particularly if depressed (use tricyclic antidepr essants here). If Ménière’s disease is the cause, betahistine helps only a few. Masking may give relief: white noise (like an off -tuned radio) is given via a noise generator worn like a post-aural hearing aid. Hearing aids may help by amplifying desirable sounds. Cochlear nerve section is a drastic option that can relieve disabling tinnitus in 25% but at the expense of deafness.
