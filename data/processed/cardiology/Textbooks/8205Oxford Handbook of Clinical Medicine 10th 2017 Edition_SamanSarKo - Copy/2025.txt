output: nil for 18h; <0.5mL/kg/h if if catheterized catheterized Local signs of infection, incl. redness, swell- Mottled, ashen, or cyanotic skin. Non- ing, or discharge around wound blanching rash (p822) Rigors, or temperature <36°C Impaired immunity (illness or drugs) Recent surgery/trauma/invasive procedure When there is a suspicion of sepsis, the criteria in table 19.3 are used to assess the patient’s risk of death or serious illness from sepsis as follows: High risk: At least one high-risk criterion OR at least two moderate- to high-risk criteria with AKI or LACTATE >2. Moderate to high risk: At least one moderate- to high-risk criterion. Low risk: No moderate- or high-risk criteria. Acute management in sepsis Early recognition and treatment is key. See fi g 19.3.2 Antibiotics: These should be broad spectrum and start within 1h. Consider covering for non-bacterial microbes, eg give aciclovir if HSV encephalitis is suspected. Fluids: Give within 1h if high risk with SBP <90, AKI, or lactate >2 (consider if <2). • Give 500mL boluses of crystalloids with 130–154mmol/L sodium (eg 0.9% saline) over 15mins. Caution in heart failure. • If no improvement after two boluses, speak with a senior. Oxygen: Give oxygen as required for target saturations. These
