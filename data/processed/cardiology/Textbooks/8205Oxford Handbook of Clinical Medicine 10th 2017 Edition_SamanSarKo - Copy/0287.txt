line (V7: posterior axillary line). Good skin preparation (clean with non-alcoholic wipe, shave if hairy, etc.) will improve ECG qual- ity. Finish 12-lead ECGs with a long rhythm strip in lead II. QRS complexes: the long and the short QRS complexes represent ventricular depolariza- tion, and width represents time, so a broader QRS Fig 3.6 Placement of ECG leads. complex means depolarization of the ventricles is taking longer. Normally, a wave of depolarization reaches the ventricles via the spe- cialist conduction pathways—the bundles of His. This delivers the electrical activity to certain points of the ventricles, meaning the waves of depolarization need travel as short a distance as possible to depolarize all the ventricular myocardium. This al- lows rapid spread of depolarization and thus an effi cient contraction action as both ventricles contract from apex to outfl ow tracts together. Hence, the QRS complex is narrow (<120ms). Ventricular depolarization takes longer when depolarization is not initiated in this pattern. For example, if it originates in the ventricles (eg ventricular ectopics, VT) or if one or more branches of the bundles of His are blocked—bundle branch blocks —meaning depolarization is initiated in one ventricle but not the other, so it has
