Avoid LP before imaging (risks coning, ie cerebellar tonsils herniate through the foramen magnum). Tumour management Benign: Remove if possible but some may be inaccessi- ble. Malignant: Excision of gliomas is hard as resection margins are rarely clear, but surgery does give a tissue diagnosis, it debulks pre-radiotherapy, and makes a cavity for inserting carmustine wafers (delivers local chemotherapy). If a tumour is inaccessible but causing hydrocephalus, a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt can help. Chemo-radiotherapy is used post-op for gliomas or metastases, and as sole therapy if surgery is impossible. Oligodendroglioma with 1p/19q deletions is especially sensi- tive. In glioblastoma, temozolomide (alkylating agent) survival. Seizure prophylaxis (eg phenyt oin) is important, but often fails. Treat headache (eg codeine 60mg/4h PO). Cerebral oedema: Dexamethasone 4mg/8h PO; mannitol if ICP acutely (p831). Plan meticulous palliative treatment (p534). Prognosis Poor but improving (<50% survival at 5yrs) for CNS primaries; 40% 20yr survival for cerebellar haemangiob lastoma; benign tumours are curable by excision. Third-ventricle colloid cysts These congenital cysts declare themselves in adult life with amnesia,headache(often positional),obtundation(blunted consciousness), incontinence, dim vision, bilateral paraesthesiae, weak legs, and drop attacks. : Excision or ventriculo-peritoneal shunting. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension Think of this in those presenting as if with a
