Peripheral stigmata of disease Specifi c signs are associated with diff erent diseases: consider the nails (koilonychia = iron defi ciency), subcutaneous nodules (rheumatoid, neurofi broma?), and look for lymph nodes (cervical, axillary, inguinal). See specifi c systems for features to assess for, but for all systems consider: Skin colour: • Blue/purple = cyanosis (can also be central only, p34). • Yellow = jaundice (yellow skin can also be caused by uraemia, pernicious anaemia, carotenaemia—check the sclera: if they are also yellow it is jaundice). • Pallor: this is non-specifi c; anaemia is assessed from the palmar skin creases (when spread) and conjunctivae (fi g 8.3)—usually pale if
