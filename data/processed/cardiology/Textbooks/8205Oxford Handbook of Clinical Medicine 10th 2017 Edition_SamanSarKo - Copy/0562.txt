Subclinical thyroid disease Subclinical hypothyroidism Suspect if TSH >4mU/L with normal T4 and T3, and no symptoms. It is common: ~10% of those >55yrs have TSH. Risk of progression to frank hypothyroidism is ~2%, and increases as TSH; risk doubles if thyroid peroxi- dase antibodies are present, and is also increased in men. Management: • Confi rm that raised TSH is persistent (recheck in 2–4 months). • Recheck the history: if any non-specifi c features (eg depression), discuss benefi ts of treating (p220) with the patient—maybe they will function better. • Have a low threshold for carefully supervised treatment as your patient may not be so asymptomatic after all, and cardiac deaths may be prevented. Treat if: 1 TSH ≥10mu/L. 2 +ve thyroid autoantibodies. 3 Past (treated) Graves’. 4 Other organ-specifi c autoimmunity (type 1 DM, myasthenia, pernicious anaemia, viti- ligo), as they are more likely to progress to clinical hypothyroidism. If TSH 4–10, and vague symptoms, treat for 6 months—only continue if symptoms improve (or the patient is trying to conceive). If the patient does not fall into any of these categories, monitor TSH yearly. • Risks from well-monitored treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism are small (but there is an
