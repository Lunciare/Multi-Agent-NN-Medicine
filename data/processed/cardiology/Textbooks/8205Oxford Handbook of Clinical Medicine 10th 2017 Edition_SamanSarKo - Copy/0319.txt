myocardial necrosis. Diff erent hospitals use diff erent assays: check the required timing of troponin blood samples where you work (eg two samples 3h apart). Other cardiac enzymes (see fi g 3.22) are sensitive but less specifi c; their role in ACS diagnosis is decreasing as troponin testing improves. Echo: Regional wall abnormalities. Diff erential diagnosis (p94.) Stable angina, pericarditis, myocarditis, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (p145), aortic dissection (p655), PE, oesophageal refl ux/spasm, pneu- mothorax, musculoskeletal pain, pancreatitis. Management See p120, pp798–801. Mortality 50% of deaths occur within 2h of onset of symptoms. Up to 7% die before discharge. Worse prognosis if: elderly, LV failure, and ST changes. 16 __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 111188 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 119 Fig 3.21 Sequential ECG changes following acute MI.

Troponin Troponins are proteins involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction (fi g 3.23). When myocardial cells are damaged, troponins are released and en- ter the bloodstream. The levels of troponin in the blood can therefore help with diagnosing myocardial damage. Troponins I and T are most specifi c to the heart. Troponin levels are most commonly measured when ACS
