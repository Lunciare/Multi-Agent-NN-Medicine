renal interstitium. Low plasma osmolality inhibits ADH secretion, thus reducing renal water reabsorption. Glomerular fi ltration rate (GFR) Defi ned as the volume of fl uid fi ltered by the glo- meruli per minute (units mL/min), and is one of the primary measures of disease progression in chronic kidney disease. It can be estimated in a number of diff erent ways (see BOX). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 666688 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC Estimating GFR 669 Calculating GFR is useful because it is a more sensitive indication of the degree of renal impairment than serum creatinine. Subjects with low muscle mass (eg the elderly, women) can have a ‘normal’ serum creatinine, despite a signifi cant reduction in GFR. This can be important when prescribing nephrotoxic drugs, or drugs that are renally excreted, which may therefore accumulate to toxic levels in the serum. A number of methods for estimating GFR exist, all relying on a calculation of the clearance of a substance that is renally fi ltered and then not reabsorbed in the renal tubule. For example, the rate of clearance of creatinine can be used as a marker for the rate of fi ltration of fl uid and solutes in the glomerulus because it
