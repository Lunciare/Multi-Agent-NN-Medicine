of 3 months. Recurrence may be precipitated by further streptococcal infections, pregnancy, or use of the oral contraceptive pill. Cardiac sequelae aff ect mitral (70%), aortic (40%), tricuspid (10%), and pulmonary (2%) valves. Incompetent lesions develop during the attack, stenoses years later. Secondary prophylaxis Penicillin V 250mg/12h PO. Alternatives: sulfadiazine 1g dai- ly (0.5g if <30kg) or erythromycin 250mg twice daily (if penicillin allergic). Duration: If carditis+persistent valvular disease, continue at least until age of 40 (sometimes lifelong). If carditis but no valvular disease, continue for 10yrs. If there is no carditis, 5yrs of prophylaxis (until age of 21) is suffi cient. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 114422 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 143 Fig 3.42 Erythema marginatum.

Causes: Functional (LV dilatation); annular calcifi cation (elderly); rheumatic fever; infective endocarditis; mitral valve prolapse; ruptured chordae tendinae; papillary muscle dysfunction/rupture (eg post-MI); connective tissue disorders (Ehlers–Danlos, Marfan’s); cardiomyopathy; congenital (may be associated with other defects, eg ASD, AV canal); appetite suppressants (eg fenfl uramine, phentermine). Symptoms: Dyspnoea; fatigue; palpitations; symptoms of causative factor (eg fever). Signs: AF; displaced,
