Consider taking a manual reading with a diff erent set yourself. Often a quiet chat will bring the BP down (yours and your patient’s: keep your ears open, and the patient may reveal some new tangential but vital fact that the offi cial history glossed over). Many things aff ect BP readings from background noise to how much you touch the patient. If BP, eg 150/90, check both arms. If the systolic diff erence is >20mmHg, consider peripheral vascular disease, and if the patient could have a thoracic aortic aneurysm or co arctation (rare). NB: right arm diastolic is normally 2.4–5mmHg higher than left. Postural hypotension This is an important cause of falls and faints in the elderly. It is defi ned as a drop in systolic BP >20mmHg or diastolic >10mmHg after standing for 3min vs lying. Causes: Hypo volaemia (early sign); drugs, eg nitrates, diuretics, antihyperten- sives, antipsychotics; Addison’s (p226); hypopituitarism (ACTH); autonomic neu- ropathy (p505, DM, multisystem atrophy, p494); after a marathon run (peripheral resistance is low for some hours); idiopathic. Treatment: • Lie down if feeling faint. • Stand slowly (with escape route: don’t move away from the chair too soon!). • Consider referral to a
