obstruction or if passed into the common bile duct (CBD10). RUQ pain (radiates  back) ± jaundice. : Analgesia (see p636), rehydrate, NBM. Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy (see BOX ‘Early or delayed cholecystectomy?’). Do urinalysis, CXR, and ECG. Acute cholecystitis follows stone or sludge impaction in the neck of the gallblad- der (GB10), which may cause continuous epigastric or RUQ pain (referred to the right shoulder—see p609), vomiting, fever, local peritonism, or a GB mass. The main dif- ference from biliary colic is the infl ammatory component (local peritonism, fever, WCC; see table 13.16). If the stone moves to the CBD, obstructive jaundice and cholan- gitis may occur—see BOX ‘Complications of gallstones’. Murphy’s sign: lay 2 fi ngers over the RUQ; ask patient to breathe in. This causes pain & arrest of inspiration as an infl amed GB impinges on your fi ngers. It is only +ve if the same test in the LUQ does not cause pain. A phlegmon (RUQ mass of infl amed adherent omentum and bowel) may be palpable. Tests: WCC, US—a thick-walled, shrunken GB (also seen in chronic disease), peri cholecystic fl uid, stones, CBD (dilated if >6mm). Plain AXR only shows ~10% of gallstones; it may
