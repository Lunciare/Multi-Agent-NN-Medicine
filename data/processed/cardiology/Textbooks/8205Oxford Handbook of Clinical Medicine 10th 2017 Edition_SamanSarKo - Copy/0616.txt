If <300, continue test. • Collect urine every 2h; measure its volume and osmolality. • Venous sample for osmolality every 4h. • Stop test after 8h (16.00) if urine osmolality >600mOsmol/kg (ie normal). Stage 2 Diff erentiate cranial from nephrogenic DI. • Proceed if urine still dilute—ie urine osmolality <600mOsmol/kg. • Give desmopressin 2mcg IM. Water can be drunk now. • Measure urine osmolality hourly for the next 4h. Table 5.5 Interpreting the water deprivation test Diagnosis Urine osmolality Normal Urine osmolality >600mOsmol/kg in Stage 1 U:P ratio >2 (normal concentrating ability) Primary polydipsia Urine concentrates, but less than normal, eg >400–600mOsmol/kg Cranial DI Urine osmolality increases to >600mOsmol/kg after desmopres- sin (if equivocal an extended water deprivation test may be tried (no drinking from 18:00 the night before)) Nephrogenic DI No increase in urine osmolality after desmopressin Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) In SIADH, ADH continues to be secreted in spite of low plasma osmolality or large plasma volume. Diagnosis requires concentrated urine (Na+ >20mmol/L and osmo- lality >100mOsmol/kg) in the presence of hyponatraemia and low plasma osmolal- ity. Causes are numerous.
