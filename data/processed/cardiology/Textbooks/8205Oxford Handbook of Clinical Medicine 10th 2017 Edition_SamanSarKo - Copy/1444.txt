C4 (denotes consumption of complement, hence C3 and C4, and C3d and C4d, their degradation products). 3 ESR. Also: BP, urine for casts or pro- tein (lupus nephritis, below), FBC, U&E, LFTs, CRP (usually normal) think of SLE when- ever someone has a multisystem disorder and ESR but CRP normal. If CRP, think instead of infection, serositis, or arthritis. Skin or renal biopsies may be diagnostic. Drug-induced lupus Causes (>80 drugs) include isoniazid, hydralazine (if >50mg/24h in slow acetylators), procainamide, quinidine, chlorpromazine, minocycline, phenyto- in, anti-TNF agents. It is associated with antihistone antibodies in >95% of cases. Skin and lung signs prevail (renal and CNS are rarely aff ected). The disease remits if the drug is stopped. Sulfonamides or the oral contraceptive pill may worsen idiopathic SLE. Management Refer: complex cases should involve specialist SLE/nephritis clinics. • General measures: High-factor sunblock. Hydroxychloroquine, unless contraindi- cated, reduces disease activity and improves survival. Screen for co-morbidities and medication toxicity. For skin fl ares, fi rst trial topical steroids. • Maintenance: NSAIDs (unless renal disease) and hydroxychloroquine for joint and skin symptoms. Azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate as steroid-spar- ing agents. Belimumab (monoclonal antibody) used as an add-on therapy for auto- antibody positive disease
