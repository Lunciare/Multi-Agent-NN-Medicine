depending on the se- verity and rate of change in serum Na+. Cardiac failure or oedema may help to indi- cate the cause. Hyponatraemia also increases the risk of falls in the elderly. 3 Causes See fi g 14.3. Artefactual causes include: •blood sample was from a drip arm •high serum lipid/protein content causing serum volume, with Na+ concentration but normal plasma osmolality •if hyperglycaemic (20mmol/L) add ~4.3mmol/L to plasma Na+ for every 10mmol/L rise in glucose above normal. Iatrogenic hyponatraemia If 5% glucose is infused continuously without adding 0.9% saline, the glucose is quickly used, rendering the fl uid hypotonic and causing hy- ponatraemia, esp. in those on thiazide diuretics, women (esp. pre-menopausal), and those undergoing physiological stress (eg post-operative, septic). In some patients, only marginally low plasma Na+ levels cause serious eff ects (eg ~128mmol/L)—don’t attribute odd CNS signs to non-existent strokes/TIAS if Na+. Management • Correct the underlying cause; never base treatment on Na+ concentration alone. The presence of symptoms, the chronicity of the hyponatraemia, and state of hy- dration are all important. Replace Na+ and water at the same rate they were lost. • Asymptomatic chronic hyponatraemia, fl uid restriction is often suffi cient if asymptomatic,
