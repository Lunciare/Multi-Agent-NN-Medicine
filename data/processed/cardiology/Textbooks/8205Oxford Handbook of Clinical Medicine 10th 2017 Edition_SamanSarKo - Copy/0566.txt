Pre-op US and ©Dr I Maddison MIBI scan may localize an adenoma; intra-operative PTH sampling is myweb.lsbu.ac.uk. used to confi rm removal. Recurrence: ~8% over 10yrs.19 Cinacalcet (a ‘calcimimetic’) sensitivity of parathyroid cells to Ca2+ ( PTH secreti on); monitor Ca2+ within 1 week of dose changes; SE: myalgia; testosterone. Secondary hyperparathyroidism Ca2+, PTH (appropriately). Causes: vit D intake, chronic renal failure.  : Correct causes. Phosphate binders; vit D; cinacalcet if PTH ≥85pmol/L and parathyroidectomy tricky. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism Ca2+, PTH (inappropriately). Occurs after pro- longed secondary hyperparathyroidism, causing glands to act autonomously having undergone hyperplastic or adenomatous change. This causes Ca2+ from secretion of PTH unlimited by feedback control. Seen in chronic renal failure. Malignant hyperparathyroidism Parathyroid-related protein (PTHrP) is produced by some squamous cell lung cancers, breast and renal cell carcinomas. This mimics PTH resulting in Ca2+ (PTH is , as PTHrP is not detected in the assay). Hypoparathyroidism Primary hypoparathyroidism PTH secretion is  due to gland failure. Tests: Ca2+, PO43Ωor , ALP. Signs: Those of hypocalcaemia, p678 ± autoimmune co morbidi ties (BOX ‘Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes’). Causes: Autoimmune; congenital (Di George syn.,
