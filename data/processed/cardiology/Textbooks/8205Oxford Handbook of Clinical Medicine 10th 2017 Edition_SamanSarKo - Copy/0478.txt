Lung volume reduction/endobronchial valve/transplant. • NIV may be appropriate if hypercapnic on LTOT. • NB: air travel is risky if FEV1 <50% or PaO2 <6.7kPa on air. • Consider palliative care input. Indications for specialist referral • Uncertain diagnosis, or suspected severe COPD, or a rapid decline in FEV1. • Onset of cor pulmonale. • Bullous lung disease (to assess for surgery). • Assessment for oral corticosteroids, nebulizer therapy, or LTOT. • <10 pack-years smoking (= the number of packs/day ≈ years of smoking) or COPD in patient <40yrs (eg is the cause 1-antitrypsin defi ciency? p290). • Symptoms disproportionate to lung function tests. • Frequent infections (to exclude bronchiectasis). 4 Cochrane meta-analyses (2007) of trials (including TORCH) favour steroids + LABA (long-acting -agonist) vs
