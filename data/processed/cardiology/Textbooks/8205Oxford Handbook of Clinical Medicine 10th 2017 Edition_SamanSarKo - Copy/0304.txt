following MI, TIA/stroke, and for patients with angina or peripheral vascular disease. May have a role in primary prevention.7 ADP receptor antagonists (eg clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) also block platelet aggregation, but may cause less gastric irritation. They have a role if truly intoler- ant of aspirin; with aspirin after coronary stent insertion; and in acute coronary syndrome. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (eg tirofi ban) have a role in unstable angina/MI.8 Anticoagulants See p350. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs, previously NOACs), eg Xa inhibitors (eg apixaban) and direct thrombin inhibitors (dabigatran), are increas- ingly replacing warfarin9 for treatment of AF and clots, see p350. Warfarin remains the anticoagulant of choice for mechanical valves. Anticoagulants used in ACS include treatment dose LMWH, fondaparinux (Xa inhibitor), & bivalirudin (thrombin inhibitor). -blockers Block -adrenoceptors, thus antagonizing the sympathetic nervous system. Blocking 1-receptors is negatively inotropic and chronotropic; blocking 2-receptors induces peripheral vasoconst riction and bronchoconstriction. Drugs vary in their 1/2 selecti vity (eg propranolol is non-selective, and bisoprolol relative- ly 1 selective), but this does not seem to alter their clinical effi cacy. Uses: Angina, hypertension, antid ysrhythmic, post MI (mortality), heart failure (with caution). CI: Severe asthma/COPD, heart block. SES: Lethargy, erectile dysfunction, joie de
