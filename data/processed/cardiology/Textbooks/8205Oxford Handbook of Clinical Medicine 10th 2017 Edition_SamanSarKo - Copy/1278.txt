The dose must be decreased slowly: over at least 2–3 months, or >6 months for benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Other interventions Psychological therapies: Eg relaxation, CBT. May benefi t some, but do not improve seizure frequency so only use as an adjunct to medica- tion. Surgical intervention: Can be considered if a single epileptogenic focus can be identifi ed (such as hippocampal sclerosis or a small low-grade tumour). Neuro- surgical resection off ers up to 70% chance of seizure resolution, but carries the risk of causing focal neurological defi cits. Alternatives: vagal nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation (DBS). Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) More common in uncontrolled epilepsy, and may be related to nocturnal seizure-associated apnoea or asystole. Those with epilepsy have 3x mortality. >700 epilepsy-related deaths are recorded/ yr in the UK; up to 17% are SUDEPs. The charity SUDEP Action may be of some help to families. 13 Sodium valproate is associated with signifi cantly risk of birth and developmental defects in children born to exposed mothers.
