≈ 109/L (20–45%). Increased in (ie lymphocytosis): • Acute viral infections. • Chronic infections, eg TB, brucellosis, hepatitis, syphilis. • Leukaemias and lymphomas, especially chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Large numbers of abnormal (‘atypical’) lymphocytes are characteristically seen with EBV infection: these are T cells reacting against EBV-infected B cells. They have a large amount of clearish cytoplasm with a blue rim that fl ows around neighbouring RBCS. Other causes of ‘atypical’ lymphocytes: see p405. Decreased in (ie lymphopenia): • Steroid therapy; SLE; uraemia; Legionnaire’s disease; HIV infection; marrow infi l- tration; post chemotherapy or radiotherapy. T-lymphocyte subset reference values: CD4 count: 537–1571/mm3 (low in HIV infection). CD8 count: 235–753/mm3; CD4/CD8 ratio: 1 . 2–3 . 8. Eosinophils (fi g 8.22) 0.04–0.4 ≈ 109/L (1–6%). Increased in (ie eosinophilia): • Drug reactions, eg with erythema multiforme, p562. • Allergies: asthma, atopy. • Parasitic infections (especially invasive helminths). • Skin disease: especially pemphigus, eczema, psoriasis, dermatitis herpetiformis. Also seen in malignant disease (including lymphomas and eosinophilic leukaemia), PAN, adrenal insuffi ciency, irradiation, Löffl er’s syndrome (p704), Churg–Strauss sym- drome (p696) and during the convalescent phase of any infection. The hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) occurs when eosinophila >1 . 5 ≈ 109/L is sustained
