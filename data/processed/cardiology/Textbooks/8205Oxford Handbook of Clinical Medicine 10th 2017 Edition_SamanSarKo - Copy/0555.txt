with radioiodine (usually a transient eff ect). Retro-orbital infl am- mation and lymphocyte infi ltration results in swelling of the orbit. Symptoms Eye discomfort, grittiness, tear production, photophobia, diplopia, acuity, aff erent pupillary defect (p72) may mean optic nerve compression: Seek expert advice at once as decompression may be needed. Nerve damage does not necessarily go hand-in-hand with protrusion. Indeed, if the eye cannot protrude for anatomical reasons, optic nerve compression is more likely—a paradox! Signs Exophthalmos—appearance of protruding eye; proptosis—eyes protrude beyond the orbit (look from above in the same plane as the forehead); conjunctival oedema; corneal ulceration; papilloedema; loss of colour vision. Ophth almoplegia (especially of upward gaze) occurs due to muscle swelling and fi brosis. Tests Diagnosis is clinical. CT/MRI of the orbits may reveal enlarged eye muscles. Management Get specialist help. Treat hyper- or hypothyroidism. Advise to stop smoking (worse prognosis). Most have mild disease that can be treated sympto- matically (artifi cial tears, sunglasses, avoid dust, elevate bed when sleeping to periorbital oedema). Diplopia may be managed with a Fresnel prism stuck to one lens of a spectacle (aids easy changing as the exophthalmos changes). In more se- vere disease, try high-dose steroids (IV methylprednisolone
