( if B12 low) may be helpful, but these are non-standard tests. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 333344 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 335 Fig 8.27 The big, beefy tongue of B12 defi ciency glossitis. Other causes of glossitis: iron (or Zn) defi ciency, pellagra, contact dermatitis/specifi c food intolerances, Crohn’s disease, drugs (minocy- cline, clarithromycin, some ACE-i), TB of the tongue. Glossitis may be the presenting feature of coeliac disease or alcoholism. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 333355 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 336 An approach to haemolytic anaemia Haemolysis is the premature breakdown of RBCS, before their normal lifespan of ~120d. It occurs in the circulation (intravascular) or in the reticuloendothelial sys- tem, ie macrophages of liver, spleen, and bone marrow (extravascular). In sickle-cell anaemia, lifespan may be as short as 5d. Haemolysis may be asymptomatic, but if the bone marrow does not compensate suffi ciently, a haemolytic anaemia results. An approach is fi rst to confi rm haemolysis and then fi nd the cause—try to answer these four questions: 1 Is there increased red cell breakdown? • Anaemia with normal or MCV. • Bilirubin: unconjugated, from haem breakdown (pre-hepatic jaundice). • Urinary urobilinogen (no urinary conjugated bilirubin). • Serum LDH, as it is released from red cells. 2 Is
