Antibiotics are also given if infection elsewhere, although unlikely, would have severe consequences (eg when prostheses are involved). A single dose given before surgery has been shown to be just as good as more prolonged regimens in biliary and colo- rectal surgery. Additional doses may be given if high-risk/prolonged procedures, or if major blood loss. Wound infections are not necessarily trivial since sepsis may lead to haemorrhage, wound dehiscence, and initiate a fatal chain of events, so take measures to minimize the risk of wound infection: • Time administration correctly (eg IV prophylaxis should be given 30min prior to surgery to maximize skin concentration; metronidazole PR is given 2h before). • Use antibiotics which will kill anaerobes and coliforms. • Consider use of peri-operative supplemental oxygen. This is a practical method of reducing the incidence of surgical wound infections. • Practise strictly sterile surgical technique. (Ask for a hand with
