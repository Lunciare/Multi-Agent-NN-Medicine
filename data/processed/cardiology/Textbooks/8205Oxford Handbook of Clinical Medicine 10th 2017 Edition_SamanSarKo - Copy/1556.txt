Tests Do virology and TB tests (p394). US shows lump consistency: cystic, solid, com- plex, vascular. CT defi nes masses in relation to their anatomical neighbours. CXR may show malignancy or, in sarcoid, reveal bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Consider fi ne-needle aspiration (FNA). Midline lumps •If patient is <20yrs old, likely diagnosis is dermoid cyst (p594). •If it moves up on tongue protrusion and is below the hyoid, likely to be a thyroglossal cyst, a fl uid-fi lled sac resulting from incomplete closure of the thyroid’s migration path. : Surgery; they are the commonest congenital cervical cystic lump. •If >20yrs old, it is probably a thyroid isthmus mass. •If it is bony hard, the diagnosis may be a chon- droma (benign cartilaginous tumour).
