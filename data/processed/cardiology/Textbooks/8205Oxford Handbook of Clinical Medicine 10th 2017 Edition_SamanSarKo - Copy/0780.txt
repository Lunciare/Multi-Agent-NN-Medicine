4–5mmol/L of K+ so caution if K+and oligo/anuria. What about colloid? Blood components should be used in resuscitation due to haemorrhage. Human albumin solutions may be given only under specialist advice in hepatorenal syndrome and as second line to crystalloids in septic shock. Hypervolaemia, fl uid overload: Occurs due to aggressive fl uid resuscitation, oliguria, and in sepsis due to capillary permeability. Monitor weight daily in patients receiving IV fl uids. Treat with: • Oxygen supplementation if required. • Fluid restriction. Consider oral and IV volumes. Give antibiotics in minimal fl uid and consider concentrated nutritional support preparations. • Diuretics. Only in symptomatic fl uid overload. They are ineff ective and poten- tially harmful if used to treat oliguria without fl uid overload. • Renal replacement therapy (p306). AKI with fl uid overload and oligo/anuria needs urgent referral to renal/critical care. Acidosis • Mild = pH 7.30–7.36 (~bicarbonate >20mmol/L). • Moderate = pH 7.20–7.29 (~bicarbonate 10–19mmol/L). • Severe = pH <7.2 (~bicarbonate <10mmol/L): refer to renal/critical care. Treatment is of the underlying disorder which will stop acid production. Where the eff ect of treatment may be delayed, acidosis will persist and renal replace- ment may be indicated (p306).
