Caution in active hyperthyroidism as risk of thyroid storm (p835). 3 Thyroidectomy (usually total): Carries a risk of damage to recurrent laryngeal nerve (hoarse voice) and hypoparathyroidism. Patients will become hypothyroid, so thyroid replacement needed. 4 In pregnancy and infancy: Get expert help. See OHCS p24 & OHCS p182. Complications Heart failure (thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy,  in elderly), angina, AF (seen in 10–25%: control hyperthyroidism and war farinize if no contraindication), osteoporosis, ophthalmopathy, gynaecomastia. Thyroid storm (p835). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 221188 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolonircodnE Thyroid eye disease 219 Seen in 25–50% of people with Graves’ disease. The main known risk factor is smoking. The eye disease may not correlate with thyroid disease and the patient can be euthyroid, hypothyroid, or hyperthyroid at presentation. Eye disease may be the fi rst presenting sign of Graves’ disease, and can also be worsened by treat- ment, typically with radioiodine (usually a transient eff ect). Retro-orbital infl am- mation and lymphocyte infi ltration results in swelling of the orbit. Symptoms Eye discomfort, grittiness, tear production, photophobia, diplopia, acuity,
