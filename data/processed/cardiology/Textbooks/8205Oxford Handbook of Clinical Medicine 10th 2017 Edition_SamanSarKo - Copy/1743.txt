of hy- dration are all important. Replace Na+ and water at the same rate they were lost. • Asymptomatic chronic hyponatraemia, fl uid restriction is often suffi cient if asymptomatic, although demeclocycline (ADH antagonist) may be required. If hy- pervolaemic (cirrhosis, CCF), treat the underlying disorder fi rst. • Acute or symptomatic hyponatraemia, or if dehydrated, cautious rehydration with 0.9% saline may be given, but do not correct changes rapidly as central pontine myelinolysis2 may result. Maximum rise in serum Na+ 15mmol/L per day if chronic, or 1mmol/L per hour if acute. Consider using furosemide when not hypovolaemic to avoid fl uid overload. • Vasopressor receptor antagonists (‘vaptans’, eg tolvaptan) promote water excre- tion without loss of electrolytes, and appear to be eff ective in treating hypervolae- mic and euvolaemic hyponatraemia but are expensive. 4  In emergency: (Seizures, coma) seek expert help. Consider hypertonic saline (eg 1.8% saline) at 70mmol Na+/h ± furosemide. Aim for a gradual increase in plasma Na+ to ≈125mmol/L. Beware heart failure and central pontine myelinolysis.2 2 Central pontine myelinolysis: irreversible and often fatal pontine demyelination seen in malnourished alcoholics or rapid correction of Na+. There is subacute onset of lethargy, confusion, pseudobulbar palsy, para-
