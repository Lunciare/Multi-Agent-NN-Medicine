via mosquitoes which bite infected hosts and ingest microfi laria. These mature in the mosquito with infective larvae transferring to new hosts during feeding. Adult worms form nests in lymphatic vessels causing damage and lymphoedema. Transmission prevented by an annual dose of two drugs—5.63 billion treatments delivered by WHO since Fig 9.29 Blood smear of 2000.12 Types of fi larial worm: • Wuchereria bancrofti (fi g 9.29) ~90% of disease. W. bancrofti (290≈8.5μm). Courtesy of Prof. S. Upton, • Brugia malaya ~10%. Kansas University. • Brugia timori possible cause of disease. Presentation: Asymptomatic infection ± subclinical lym- phatic damage. Acute episodes of local infl ammation: pain, fever. Chronic damage: lymphoedema (fi g 9.30), hydrocele, chylocele, scrotal/penile swelling. CKD: proteinuria, haema- turia. Immune hyperr eactivity tropical pulmonary eo- sinophilia (cough, wheeze, fi brosis, eosinophil counts, IgE). Diagnosis: Microfi lariae in blood smear (fi g 9.29), antifi larial IgG, visualization of worms on USS/tissue sample. Treatment: Lymphoedema care. Prevention in high-risk populations: al- bendazole plus either diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or ivermec-Fig 9.30 Lymphoedema. Reproduced with permis- tin. DEC is contraindicated in onchocerciasis (p439), care with sion from World Health circulating Loa Loa (p439) due to risk of encephalopathy and Organization. © World renal
