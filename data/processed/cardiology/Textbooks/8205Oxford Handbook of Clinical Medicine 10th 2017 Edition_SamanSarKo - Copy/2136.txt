of over-resuscitation (‘fl uid creep’) which can lead to complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome. Treatment ‘Cool the burn, warm the patient.’ Do not apply cold water to extensive burns for long periods: this may intensify shock. Take care with circumferential full- thickness burns of the limbs as compartment syndrome may develop rapidly particu- larly after fl uid resuscitation. Decompress (escharotomy and fasciotomy) as needed. If transferring to a burns unit, do not burst blisters or apply any special creams as this can hinder assessment. Simple saline gauze or paraffi n gauze is suitable; cling fi lm is useful as a temporary measure and relieves pain. Titrate morphine IV for good analgesia. Ensure tetanus immunity. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not routinely used. Defi nitive dressings There are many dressings for partial thickness burns, eg bio- logical (pigskin, cadaveric skin), synthetic, and silver sulfadia zine cream alone or with cerium nitrate as Flammacerium®; it forms a leathery eschar which resists infection. Major full-thickness burns benefi t from early tangential excision and split- skin grafts as the burn is a major source of infl ammatory cytokines and forms a rich medium for bacterial growth. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 884466 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE Smoke inhalation 847 Consider
