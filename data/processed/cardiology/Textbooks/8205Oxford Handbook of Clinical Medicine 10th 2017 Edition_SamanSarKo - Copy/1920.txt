torsion of testis (p652): surgery not Doppler US. Prior to the advent of interventional radiology, a collapsed, shocked patient with an acute abdomen would have skipped CT and gone straight for a laparotomy. However, you should bear in mind that ruptured aneurysms are increasingly being managed by endovascular repair under fl uoroscopic guidance (p654) so this is one area where rapid imaging may be preferable to immediate intervention. Fig 16.43 This is a great educational image from ICU. The inexperienced doctor could be dis- tracted by the poor quality image, missing the lung bases: technicians do their best under dif- fi cult conditions. To ask for a new CXR here would be a mistake note the large right-sided tension pneumothorax needing immediate decompression! Lungs: The right lung fi eld is too black compared to the left, the right hemidiaphragm is depressed, and the right lung is seen collapsed against the mediastinum. Mediastinum: Left-shifted, obstructing venous return—so cardiac output, and a threat to life. Is it being pushed or pulled? Check hila, bones, and soft tis- sues. Since the right lung is collapsed and mediastinum shifted to left this suggests right ten- sion pneumothorax. Needle thoracocentesis decompression and a chest drain
