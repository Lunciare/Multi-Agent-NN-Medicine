Much of the superior sagittal sinus is not seen because it is fi lled with clot—a superior sagittal sinus thrombo- sis. The arrows point to where it should be seen. Posteriorly, the irregularity of the vessel indicates non-occlusive clot. Image and commentary courtesy of Prof. P. Scally. Fig 10.20 MRI showing thrombus (arrows) in the sagittal sinus (sagittal T1-weighted image, LEFT), and in the right transverse sinus (axial T2-weighted image, RIGHT). Often more than one sinus is involved. Image courtesy of Dr David Werring. Fig 10.21 Venous territories (compare with arterial territories on p451). SSS—superior sagittal sinus; TS—transverse sinus; SV—Sylvian veins; ICV—internal cortical veins. There is much greater variation in venous anatomy between individuals than there is in arterial anatomy, so this diagram is only a rough guide. The key point is to realize that infarction that crosses boundaries between arterial territories may be venous in origin. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 448811 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN 482 Subdural haematoma Consider this very treatable condition in all whose conscious
