caused by posterior or inferior cerebellar artery occlusion leading to brainstem infarction (fi g 15.21). Features: • Dysphagia, dys arthria (IX and X nuclei). • Vertigo, nausea, vomiting, nystagmus (vestibular nu- cleus). • Ipsilateral ataxia (inferior cerebellar peduncle). • Ipsilateral Horner’s syn- drome (descending sympathetic fi bres). • Loss of pain and temperature sensation on the ipsilateral face (V nucleus) and contralateral limbs (spinothalamic tract). There is no limb weakness as the pyramidal tracts are unaff ected. In the rarer medial medullary syndrome, vertebral or anterior spinal artery occlusion causes ipsilateral tongue paralysis (XII nucleus) with contralateral limb weakness (pyramidal tract, sparing the face) and loss of position sense.
