4 Fundi—papilloedema, subhyaloid haemorrhage, hypertensive retinopathy, signs of other disease (eg diabetic retinopathy). • Examine for CNS asymmetry (tone, spontaneous movements, refl exes). One way to test for hemiplegia in coma is to raise both arms together and compare how they fall under gravity. If one descends fast, like a lead weight, but the other descends more gracefully, you have found a valuable focal sign of cortical dys- function. The same applies to the legs.

Often defi ned by BP— systolic <90mmHg—or mean arterial pressure (MAP) <65mmHg—with evidence of tissue hypoperfusion, eg mottled skin, urine output (UO) of <0.5mL/kg/h, serum lactate >2mmol/L. Signs: GCS/agitation, pallor, cool peripheries, tachycardia, slow capillary refi ll, tachypnoea, oliguria. MAP = cardiac output (CO) ≈ systemic vascular resistance (SVR). CO = stroke volume ≈ heart rate.   shock can result from inadequate CO or a loss of SVR, or both. Inadequate cardiac output • Hypovolaemia: • Bleeding: trauma, ruptured aortic aneurysm, GI bleed. • Fluid
