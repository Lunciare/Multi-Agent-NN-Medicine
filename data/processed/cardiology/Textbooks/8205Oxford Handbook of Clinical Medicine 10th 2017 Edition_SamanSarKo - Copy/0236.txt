Social history Try to gain an impression of support network if suspect malignancy. Breast pain Is it premenstrual (cyclical mastalgia, OHCS p254)? Breast cancer (refer, eg, for mammography if needed)? If non-malignant and non-cyclical, think of: • Tietze’s syndrome (costochondritis plus swelling of the costal cartilage) • Bornholm disease/Devil’s grip (Coxsackie B virus, causing chest and abdominal pain, which may be mistaken for cardiac pain or an acute surgical abdomen. It resolves within ~2 weeks) • angina • gallstones • lung disease • thoracic outlet syndrome • oestrogens/HRT. If none of the above, wearing a fi rm bra all day may help, as may NSAIDS. Nipple discharge Causes: Duct ectasia (green/brown/red, often multiple ducts and bilateral), intra- ductal papilloma/adenoma/carcinoma (bloody discharge, often single duct), lacta- tion. Management: Diagnose the cause (mammogram, ultrasound, ductogram); then treat appropriately. Cessation of smoking reduces discharge from duct ecta- sia. Microdochectomy/total duct excision can be considered if other
