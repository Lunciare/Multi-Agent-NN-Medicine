chlortalidone, metolazone): Inhibit the NaCl transporter  decrease NaCl reabsorption and increase water loss. Used to treat BP (p140). Side eff ects: hy- ponatraemia, hypokalaemia, and hypomagnesaemia. However, calcium excretion is reduced (in contrast to loop diuretics)  can be used to treat recurrent kidney stones in patients with hypercalciuria. Excretion of uric acid is reduced (care in gout). Glucose intolerance can occur (mechanism may be related to hypokalae- mia) so care in DM. Increase in LDL cholesterol is not signifi cant with chronic use at low dose, especially in the context of benefi cial BP reduction. Cortical collecting duct Physiology Acid–base and K+ homeostasis. Aldosterone acts to retain Na+and excrete K+. Pathology Distal (type 1) renal tubular acidosis (RTA): Failure of acid (H+) excretion. Primary genetic disease or secondary to autoimmune disease (eg Sjögren’s syndrome, SLE), toxins (eg lithium). Can cause, or be caused by, nephrocalcinosis (eg medullary sponge kidney, sarcoid). Leads to bone demineralization, renal calculi. Hypoka- laemia can be severe. Diagnosis: urine fails to acidify (pH >5.3) despite metabolic acidosis. Treat with bicarbonate replacement and management of underlying dis- ease. Type 4 RTA: Hyperkalaemia and acidosis due to (real or apparent) hypoaldo- steronism, eg adrenal insuffi ciency,
