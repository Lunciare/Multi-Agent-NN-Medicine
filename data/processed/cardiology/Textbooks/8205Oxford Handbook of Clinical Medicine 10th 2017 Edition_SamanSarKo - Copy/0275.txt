is 60–100bpm. • Rhythm: If cycles are not clearly regular, use the ‘card method’: lay a card along the ECG, marking positions of three successive R waves. Slide the card to and fro to check that all intervals are equal. If they are not, note if: • there is slight but regular lengthening and then shortening (with respiration)— sinus arrhythmia, common in the young • there are diff erent rates which are multiples of each other—varying block • it is 100% irregular—atrial fi brillation (AF) or ventricular fi brill ation (VF). Sinus rhythm is characterized by a P wave followed by a QRS complex. AF has no dis- cernible P waves and QRS complexes are irregularly irregular. Atrial fl utter (p130, fi g 3.35 p131) has a ‘sawtooth’ baseline of atrial depolarization (~300/min) and regular QRS complexes. Ventricular rhythm has QRS complexes >0.12s with P waves follow- ing them or absent (fi g 3.12, p106). • Axis: The overall direction of depolarization across the patient’s anterior chest; this is the sum of all the ventricular electrical forces during ventricular depolarization. See BOX ‘Determining the ECG axis’. Left axis deviation can result from left anterior hemiblock, inferior MI, VT from a
