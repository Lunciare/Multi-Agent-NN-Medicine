service if: two 1st-degree relatives with colorectal cancer at average age <60yrs, or if criteria for an autosomal dominant colorectal cancer syndrome is met: • Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)): 1–3% of colorectal cancer. Autosomal dominant due to mutations in mismatch repair genes. Lifetime risk of colorectal cancer up to ~80%. Increased risk of other ‘Lynch cancers’: endometrium, ovary, urinary tract, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary tract. Suspect if ≥3 aff ected relatives (one 1st-degree), from two successive gen- erations, of whom one was aff ected <50yrs old. Colonoscopic surveillance (at least biennial) from 25–75yrs. • Familial adenomatous polyposis: Due to mutations in the APC tumour suppressor gene (5q) (fi g 11.2). <1% of colorectal cancer. Causes multiple colorectal adenomas (>100 in classical disease) which undergo malignant transformation. Gene pen- etrance approaches 100% by 50yrs. Surveillance sigmoidoscopy from 12yrs, with prophylactic surgery usually <25yrs guided by polyp number, size, and dysplasia. • Peutz–Jeghers syndrome: 1 in 25 000–280 000. Hamartomatous polpys. 10–20% risk of colorectal cancer, ~50–60% risk of GI cancer, ~60% risk of breast cancer. Due to germline mutations in STK11, a tumour suppressor gene (19p14). Surveillance in all (see p708). Prostate cancer 5–10% (~50% disease <55yrs) estimated
