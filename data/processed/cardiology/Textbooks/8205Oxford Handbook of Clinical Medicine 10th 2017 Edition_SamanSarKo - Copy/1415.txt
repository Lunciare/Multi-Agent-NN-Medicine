replacement (hips, or knees) is the best way to deal with severe OA that has a substantial impact on quality of life. Septic arthritis Consider septic arthritis in any acutely infl amed joint, as it can destroy a joint in under 24h and has a mortaility rate up to 11%. Infl ammation may be less overt if im- munocompromised (eg from medication) or if there is underlying joint disease. The knee is aff ected in >50% cases. Risk factors Pre-existing joint disease (especially rheumatoid arthritis); diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, chronic renal failure, recent joint surgery, prosthetic joints (where infection is particularly diffi cult to treat), IV drug abuse, age >80yrs.9 Investigations Urgent joint aspiration for synovial fl uid microscopy and culture is the key investigation (p541), as plain radiographs and CRP may be normal. The main diff erential diagnoses are the crystal arthropathies (p548). Blood cultures are es- sential (prior to antibiotics). Ask yourself ‘How did the organism get there?’ Is there immuno suppression, or another focus of infection, eg from indwelling IV lines, infected skin, or pneumonia (present in up to 50% of those with pneumococcal arthritis)?10 Treatment If in doubt start empirical IV antibiotics (after aspiration) until sensi- tivities
