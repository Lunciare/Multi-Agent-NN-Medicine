= Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events. Risk is scored based on age, heart rate, BP, re- nal function, Killip class of heart failure, and other events, eg raised troponin. Very complicated to calculate so recommendation by European Society of Cardiology is to use an online calculator, eg __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 779988 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE  Acute management of cardiac chest pain 799 Monitor closely; record ECG while in pain If SaO2 <90% or breathless, low-fl ow O2 Analgesia: Eg morphine 5–10mg IV + metoclopramide 10mg IV Nitrates: GTN spray or sublingual tablets as required Aspirin: 300mg PO. Consider need for second antiplatelet agent (see ‘Oral antiplatelet therapy’ in text) Measure troponin and clinical parameters to risk assess, eg GRACE score2 Invasive strategy (high-risk pt): Conservative strategy (low-risk pt): • Rise in troponin OR: • No recurrence of chest pain • Dynamic ST or T–wave changes • No signs of heart failure • Secondary criteria—diabetes, CKD, • Normal ECG LVEF <40%, early angina post MI, • —ve baseline (± repeat) troponin recent PCI, prior CABG, intermedi- May be discharged (check troponin ate to high-risk GRACE score interval required with your laboratory and retest after delay if necessary). Arrange further outpatient investiga- tion,
