(xanthopsia), delirium. GI: nausea. Gentamicin1,2 (p387) and tobramycin. 1, 2 The potential for oto- and nephrotoxic- ity is high if aminoglycosides are used inappropriately, so only prescribe for short therapeutic courses and follow local expert advice/guidelines. CI in severe renal or liver failure, ascites, burns, high cardiac output states (eg anaemia, Paget’s disease), children, and pregnancy. Signs of toxicity: tinnitus, deafness, nystag mus, vertigo, renal failure. Once-daily dosing with dose adjustment is prefered as this has fewer SES and better bactericidal activity (eg gentamicin 5mg/kg/d or tobramycin 4mg/ kg/d; check with pharmacist in obese patients or when using tobramycin in cystic fi brosis). An exception to this dosing is endocarditis: split dosing (eg gentamicin 1mg/kg/8h or 12-hourly in renal failure) increases the synergistic bactericidal eff ect of other agents. Trough (just before dose) levels and renal function should initially be monitored daily (can be twice weekly in stable patients with normal renal func- tion)—aim for trough: <1mg/L for both gentamicin and tobramycin. If the trough level is out of range, withold the next dose until level <1mg/L (recheck after 12–24h). Lithium2 (12h post dose). Guidelines vary: 0.4–0.8mmol/L is reasonable. Early signs of toxicity (Li+ >1.5mmol/L): tremor. Intermediate: lethargy. Late: (Li+
