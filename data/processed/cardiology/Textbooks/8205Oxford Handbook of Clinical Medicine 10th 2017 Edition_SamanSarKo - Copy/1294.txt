Idiopathic intracranial hypertension Think of this in those presenting as if with a mass (headache, ICP, and papilloede- ma)—when none is found. Most commonly seen in obese females in 3rd decade, who present with narrowed visual fi elds, blurred vision ± diplopia, VIth nerve palsy, and an enlarged blind spot, if papilloedema is present (it usually is). Consciousness and cognition are preserved. Associations Endocrine abnormalities (Cushing’s syndrome, hypoparathyroidism, TSH), SLE, CKD, IDA, PRV, drugs (tetracycline, steroids, nitrofurantoin, and oral con- traceptives). Management Weight loss, acetazolamide or topiramate, loop diuretics, and predni- solone (start at ~40mg/24h PO; more SE than diuretics). Consider optic nerve sheath fenestration or lumbar–peritoneal shunt if drugs fail and visual loss worsens. Prognosis Often self-limiting. Permanent signifi cant visual loss in 10%. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 449988 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN Localizing features 499 Temporal lobe: •Dysphasia (p86). •Contralateral homonymous hemia nopia (or upper quadrantanopia if only Meyer’s loop aff ected). •Amnesia. •Many odd or seemingly inexplicable phenomena, p491.
