been associated with an increased risk of bleeding.9 SSRIs are thought to increase gastric acidity and serotonin is thought to play a role in platelet ag- gregation. This may lead to an increased risk of ulcers and bleeding, particularly when co-prescribed with anticoagulants and drugs aff ecting intestinal lining (eg NSAIDS). NICE10 recommends cautious concomitant use of SSRIs with anticoagu- lants or NSAIDS and recommends gastroprotection (eg PPI) for older patients tak- ing NSAIDs or aspirin. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 5577 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 noitanimaxe dna yrotsiH 58 Gastrointestinal symptoms Faecal incontinence This is common in the elderly. Do your best to help, and get social services involved if concerned. Continence depends on many factors—mental function, stool (volume and consistency), anatomy (sphincter function, rectal distensibility, anorectal sensa- tion and refl exes). Defects in any area can cause loss of faecal continence. Causes: Often multifactorial. Is it passive faecal soiling or urgency-related stool loss? Consider the following: • Sphincter dysfunction: • Vaginal delivery is the commonest cause due to sphincter tears or pudendal nerve damage. • Surgical trauma, eg following procedures for fi stulas, haemorrhoids, fi ssures. • Impaired sensation—diabetes, MS, dementia, any spinal cord lesions (consider cord compression if acute faecal incontinence). • Faecal
