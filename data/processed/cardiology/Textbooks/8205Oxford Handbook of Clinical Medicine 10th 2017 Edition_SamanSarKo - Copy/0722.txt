isolation of HCV in the late 1980s, riding the wave of the AIDS scare, less than three decades have elapsed. In this time, the comparatively sim- ple genome of HCV has proven far easier than HIV to combat and the treatment of HCV has undergone nothing less than a revolution to the point where many common genotypes are considered curable. All patients with sustained detectable HCV should be considered for treatment. Options are evolving rapidly, but centre on the use of inhibitors of non-structural viral proteins (eg ledipasvir+sofosbuvir) which are much better tolerated than the previous mainstay of treatment, pegylated interferon. Interferon-free regimens therefore eliminate major barriers to compliance including treatment duration and SES, as well as achieving superior results: contemporary antiviral regimens can now realistically achieve the complete absence of PCR detectable virus in the blood 6 months post-treatment in almost 100% of genotype 1 patients, including patients with established cirrhosis. Ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue, can also increasingly be avoided in genotype 1, though it remains a useful treatment for the harder to treat genotypes 2 and 3. Here, reported rates of sustained undetectable viral levels now routinely exceed 90%. The costs of treatment are staggering, but cost-eff ec-
