Secretion by four para- thyroid glands is triggered by serum ionized Ca2+; controlled by Ωve feedback loop. Actions are: •osteoclast activity releasing Ca2+ and PO43Ω from bones •Ca2+ & PO43Ω reabsorption in the kidney •renal production of 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3. Vitamin D and calcitriol: Vit D is hydroxylated fi rst in the liver to 25-hydroxy-vit D, and again in the kidney to 1,25-dihydroxy-vit D (calcitriol), the biologically active form, and 24,25-hydroxy-vit D (inactive). Calcitriol production is stimulated by Ca2+, PO43Ω, and PTH. Actions are: •Ca2+ and PO43Ω absorption from the gut •inhibition of PTH release •enhanced bone turnover •Ca2+ and PO43Ω reabsorption in the kidney. Chole- calciferol (vit D3—from animal sources) and ergocalciferol (vit D2—from vegetables) are biologically identical in their activity. Disordered regulation of calcitriol underlies familial normocalca emic
