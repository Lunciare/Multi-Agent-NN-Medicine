the aff ected eye, the consensual pupillary relaxation response from the normal eye predominates. This is the Marcus Gunn sign, and may occur after apparent complete recovery from the initial lesion. Reaction to accommodation/convergence: If the patient fi rst looks at a distant object and then at the examiner’s fi nger held a few inches away, the eyes will con- verge and the pupils constrict. Aff erent fi bres in each optic nerve pass to the lateral geniculate bodies. Impulses then pass to the pre-tectal nucleus and then to the para- sympathetic nuclei of the IIIrd cranial nerves, causing pupillary constriction. • Holmes–Adie (myotonic) pupil: The aff ected pupil is normally moderately dilated and is poorly reactive to light, if at all. It is slowly reactive to accommodation; wait and watch carefully: it may eventually constrict more than a normal pupil. It is often associated with diminished or absent ankle and knee refl exes, in which case the Holmes–Adie syndrome is present. Usually a benign incidental fi nding. Rare causes: Lyme disease, syphilis, parvovirus B19, HSV, autoimmunity. >. • Argyll Robertson pupil: This occurs in neurosyphilis. The pupil is constricted and unreactive to light, but reacts to accommodation. Other possible
