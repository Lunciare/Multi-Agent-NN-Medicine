Epigastric pain ‘bores’ through to the back, eg relieved by sitting forward or hot water bottles on epigastrium/back (look for erythema ab igne’s mottled dusky greyness); bloating; steatorrhoea; weight; brittle diabetes. Symptoms relapse and worsen. Causes Alcohol; smoking; autoimmune; rarely: familial; cystic fi brosis; haemochro- matosis; pancreatic duct obstruction (stones/tumour); congenital (pancreas divisum). Tests Ultrasound ± CT: pancreatic calcifi cations confi rm the diagnosis, MRCP; AXR. Speckled calcifi cation; faecal elastase. Treatment Drugs: Give analgesia (coeliac-plexus block may give brief relief); lipase, eg Creon®; fat-soluble vitamins. Insulin needs may be high or variable (beware hy- poglycaemia). Diet: No alcohol; low fat may help. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT oil) may be tried (no lipase needed for absorpt ion, but diarrhoea may be worsened). Surgery: For unremitting pain; narcotic abuse (beware of this); weight: eg pancrea- tectomy or pancreaticojejunostomy (a duct drainage procedure). Complications Pseudocyst; diabetes; biliary obstruction; local arterial aneurysm; splenic vein thrombosis; gastric varices; pancreatic carcinoma. Carcinoma of the pancreas Epidemiology ≈3% of all malignancy; ~9000 deaths/yr (UK). UK incidence is rising. Typical patient  >70yrs old. Risk factors Smoking, alcohol, carcinogens, DM, chronic pancreatitis, waist circumference (ie adiposity), and possibly a high-fat and red or processed meat diet. Pathology Mostly
