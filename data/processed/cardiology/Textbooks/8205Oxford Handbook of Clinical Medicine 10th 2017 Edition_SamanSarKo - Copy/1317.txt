of the spinal canal and intervertebral foramina (fi gs 10.27, 10.28). As the neck fl exes and extends, the cord is dragged over these protruding bony spurs anteriorly and indented by a thickened ligamentum fl avum posteriorly. Presenting complaint Neck stiff ness (but common in anyone >50yrs old), crepitus on moving neck, stabbing or dull arm pain (brachialgia), forearm/wrist pain. Signs Limited, painful neck movement ± crepitus (examine gently). Neck fl exion may produce tingling down the spine (Lhermitte’s sign, p497). NB: this does not distinguish between cord or roots (or both) involvement. Root compression (radiculopathy): Pain/‘electrical’ sensations in arms or fi ngers at the level of the compression (table 10.11), with numbness, dull refl exes, LMN weakness, and eventual wasting of muscles innervated by the aff ected root. NB: UMN signs below level of the aff ected root suggests cord compression. Features of cord compression: Progressive symptoms (eg weak, clumsy hands; gait disturbance); UMN leg signs (spastic weakness, plantars); LMN arm signs (wast- ing, hyporefl exia); incontinence, hesitancy, and urgency are late features. Which nerve root is aff ected? See table 10.11.  MS; nerve root neurofi broma; subacute combined degeneration of the cord (B12); compression by bone or
