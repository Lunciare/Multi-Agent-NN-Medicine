for asthma. Sometimes bron- choscopic aspiration of mucus plugs is needed. 3 Aspergilloma (mycetoma): A fungus ball within a pre-existing cavity (often caused by TB or sarcoidosis). It is usually asymptomatic but may cause cough, haemoptysis (may be torrential), lethargy ± weight loss. Investigations: CXR (round opacity within a cavity, usually apical); sputum culture; strongly posi- tive serum precipitins; Aspergillus skin test (30% +ve). Treatment (only if symp- tomatic): consider surgical excision for solitary symptomatic lesions or severe haemoptysis. Oral itraconazole and other antifungals have been tried with lim- ited success. Local instillation of amphotericin paste under CT guidance yields partial success in carefully selected patients, eg in massive haemoptysis. 4 Invasive aspergillosis: Risk factors: 27 immunocompromise, eg HIV, leukaemia, burns, Wegener’s (p714), and SLE, or after broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. In- vestigations: sputum culture; BAL; biopsy; serum precipitins; CXR (consolidation, abscess). Early chest CT and serial serum measurements of galactomannan (an Aspergillus antigen) may be helpful. Diagnosis may only be made at lung biopsy or autopsy. Treatment: voriconazole is superior to IV amphotericin. 28 Alterna- tives: IV miconazole or ketoconazole (less eff ective). Prognosis: 30% mortality. 5 Extrinsic allergic alveolitis (EAA): See p198. Other fungal infections Candida and Cryptococcus may
