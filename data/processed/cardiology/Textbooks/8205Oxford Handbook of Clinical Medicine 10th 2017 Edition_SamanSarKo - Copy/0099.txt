rigors, sweats While some night sweating is common in anxiety, drenching sweats requiring changes of night-clothes are a more ominous symptom associated with infection (eg TB, brucellosis), lymphoproliferative disease, or other malignancies. Patterns of fever may be relevant (see p442). Rigors are uncontrolled paroxysms of shivering which occur as a patient’s tem- perature rises rapidly. Sweating excessively (hyperhidrosis) may be primary (eg hidradenitis sup- purativa may be very distressing to the patient)—or secondary to fever, pain or anxiety (cold & sweaty) or a systemic condition: the menopause, hyperthyroidism (warm & sweaty), acromegaly, malignancy, phaeochromocytoma, amyloidosis, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (+hyper thermia). Or it may refl ect gabapentin or opiate withdrawal, or a choline r gic or parasympathomimetic side-eff ect (ami- triptyline, bethanechol, distigmine, spider bites)—also hormonal drugs, eg levo- thyroxine, gonadorelin or somatostatin analogu es, vasopressin, and ephedrine. Also amiodarone, ciprofl oxacin, levodopa, lisinopril, rivastigmine, ritonavir, pioglitazone, venlafaxine. At the bedside: ask about all drugs, examine all over for nodes; any signs of hyperthyroidism? Any splenom egaly? Test the urine; do T°, ESR, TSH, FBC, & blood culture. : Antiperspirants (aluminium chloride 20%=Driclor®), sympathec- tomy, or iontophoresis may be tried. Insomnia This is trivial—until we ourselves have a few sleepless
