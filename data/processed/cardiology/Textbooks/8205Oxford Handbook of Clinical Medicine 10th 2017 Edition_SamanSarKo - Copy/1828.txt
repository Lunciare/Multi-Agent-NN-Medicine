hamartomas are excessive focal overgrowths of normal cells in an organ composed of the same cell type. Johannes LA Peutz, 1886–1957 (Dutch physician); Harold J Jeghers, 1904–1990 (US physician) Peyronie’s disease (Penile angulation.) Pathogenesis: A poorly understood connec- tive tissue disorder most commonly attributed to repetitive microvascular trauma during sexual intercourse, resulting in penile curvature and painful erec ti le dysfunc- tion (in 50%; p230). Preval ence: 3–9%. Typical age: >40yrs. Associations: Dupuytren’s (p698); atheroma; radical prosta tectomy.  : Haemangioma. Tests: Ultrasound/MRI. : Oral potassium para-aminobenzoate (Potaba®), intralesional verapamil, clostridial collagenase, or interferon 2B; topical verapamil 15% gel; iontophoresis with vera- pamil and dexamethasone. All have various success.59 Surgery: (If disease stable for >3 months) tunica plication ± penile prostheses. Manage associated depression (seen in 48%). Penile rehabilitation can help (p230).60 Francois Gigot de la Peyronie, 1678–1747 (French surgeon) Pott’s syndrome (Spinal TB.) Rare in the West, this is usually from an extra-spinal source, eg lungs. Features: Backache, and stiff ness of all back movements. Fever, night sweats, and weight loss occur. Progressive bone destruction leads to vertebral collapse and gibbus (sharply angled spinal curvature). Abscess formation may lead to cord compression, causing paraplegia, and bowel/bladder dysfunction (p466). X-
