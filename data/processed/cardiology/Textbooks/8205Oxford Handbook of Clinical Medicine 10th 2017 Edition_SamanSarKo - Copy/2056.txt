Fig 19.10 Management of narrow complex tachycardia (supraventricular tachycardia).  Irregular narrow complex tachycardia • Treat as AF—by far the most likely diagnosis. • Control rate with: • -blocker: eg metoprolol 1–10mg IV, give small increments to slow rate • rate-limiting Ca2+-channel blocker eg verapamil 5–10mg IV • digoxin is an alternative in heart failure (load with eg 500mcg PO then 500mcg PO after 8h and further 250mcg PO after 8h) • amiodarine (may also control rhythm—see last bullet point in this box). • Consider anticoagulation with warfarin or NOAC to  risk of stroke. • If onset defi nitely <48h, or if eff ectively anticoagulated for >3wk, consider car- dioversion with synchronized DC cardioversion under sedation (see p770). Chemi- cal cardioversion may be achieved with fl ecanide 300mg PO (only if defi nitely no structural heart damage) or amiodarone, 300mg IVI over 20–60min, then 900mg over 24h. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 880077 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 880088 Bradycardia Bradycardia is defi ned as a heart rate <60bpm.
