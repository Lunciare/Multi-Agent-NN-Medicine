The hunt goes on to fi nd them. You can run your own drug trial, choose what to publish, and watch how the data become skewed at: www.alltrials.net/news/the-economist-publication-bias. After half a decade, under ceaseless demand, and with the withholding of data become increasingly indefensible, the clinical study reports were released. These are normally used to provide authorities with a detailed trial report. They are not easy fodder for meta-analysis. Assessing 160 000 pages was uncharted territory for Cochrane. And the conclusion: oseltamivir shortens symptoms by <1d and hos- pitalization is not reduced. Other complications were unreliably reported. The WHO includes oseltamivir on its WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (19th edition, 2015) which means it is considered effi cacious, safe, cost-eff ective, and a minimum requirement for basic healthcare. Does this stand up to independent scrutiny? The evidence base is certainly tarnished. But a pandemic is not a RCT. And the threshold of evidence to reverse policy decisions may be diff erent from the threshold needed to introduce them. If
