structures. Screening All  at age 65yr are invited for screening in UK, decreases mortality from ruptured AAA. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) Death rates/year from ruptured AAAS rise with age: 125 per million in those aged 55–59; 2728 per million if over 85yrs. Symptoms & signs: Intermittent or continuous abdominal pain (radiates to back, iliac fossae, or groins; don’t dismiss this as renal colic), collapse, an expansile abdominal mass (it expands and contracts, unlike swellings that are purely pulsatile, eg nodes overlying arteries), and shock. If in doubt, assume a ruptured aneurysm. Unruptured AAA Defi nition: >3cm across. Prevalence: 3% of those >50yrs.  :  >3 : 1. Less common in diabetics. Cause: Degeneration of elastic lamellae and smooth muscle loss. There is a genetic component. Symptoms: Often none, they may cause abdominal/back pain, often discovered incidentally on abdominal examination (see BOX). Monitoring: RCTS have failed to demonstrate benefi t from early endovascular repair (EVAR, see later in paragraph) of aneurysms <5.5cm (where rupture rates are low). Risk of rupture below this size is <1%/yr, compared to ~25%/yr for aneurysms >6cm across. ~75% of aneurysms under monitoring will eventually need repair. Rup- ture is more likely if: •BP
