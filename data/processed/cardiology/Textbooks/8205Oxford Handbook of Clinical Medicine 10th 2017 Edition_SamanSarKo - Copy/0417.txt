The aorta overrides the VSD, accepting right heart blood. A few patients also have an ASD, which makes up the pentad of Fallot. Presentation: Severity of illness depends greatly on the degree of pulmonary stenosis. Infants may be acyanotic at birth, with a pulmonary stenosis mur- mur as the only initial fi nding. Gradually (especially after closure of the ductus arteriosus) they become cyanotic due to decreasing fl ow of blood to the lungs Fig 3.52 Tetralogy of Fallot. and increasing right-to-left fl ow across the VSD.

Adult patients are often asymp- tomatic. In the unoperated adult patient, cyanosis is common, although extreme cyanosis or squatting is uncommon. In repaired patients, late symptoms include exertional dyspnoea, palpitations, clubbing, RV failure, syncope, and even sudden death. Investigations: ECG shows RV hypertrophy with a right bundle-branch block. CXR may be normal, or show the hallmark of TOF, which is the classic
