Suprapubic catheter insertion is high risk and you should be trained before attempting it, speak to the urologists fi rst. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 776622 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 serudecorp lacitcarP Self-catheterization 763 This is a good, safe way of managing chronic retention from a neuropathic bladder (eg in multiple sclerosis, diabetic neuropathy, spinal tumour, or trauma). Never consider a patient in diffi culties from a big residual volume to be too old, young, or disabled to learn. 5-yr-old children can learn the technique, and can have their lives transformed—so motivation may be excellent. There may be fewer UTIs as there is no residual urine—and less refl ux obstructive uropathy. Assessing suit- ability entails testing sacral dermatomes: a ‘numb bum’ implies sensation of a full bladder; higher sensory loss may mean catheterization will be painless. Get help from your continence adviser who will be in a position to teach the patient or carer that catheterizations must be gentle (the catheter is of a much smaller calibre), particularly if sensation is lacking, and must number >4/d (‘always keep your catheter with you; don’t wait for an urge before catheterizing’).
