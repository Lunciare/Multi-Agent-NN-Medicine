sinus pauses. Some patients develop a ‘tachy brady syndrome’, suff ering from alternating tachycardic and bradycardic rhythms. This can prove diffi cult to treat medically as treating one circumstance (eg tachycardia) increases the risk from the other. Pacing for bradycardic episodes in combination with rate-slowing medications for tachycardic episodes may be required if the patient is symptomatic or unstable. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 112255 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 126 Narrow complex tachycardia Defi nition ECG shows rate of >100bpm and QRS complex duration of <120ms. Narrow QRS complexes occur when the ventricles are depolarized via the normal conduction pathways (fi g 3.26). Diff erential diagnosis Regular narrow complex tachycardias: See fi g 3.27. Irregular narrow complex tachycardias: • Normal variant: sinus arrhythmia (rate changes with inspiration/expiration); sinus rhythm with frequent ectopic beats. • Atrial fi brillation (AF): p131, fi g 3.35. • Atrial fl utter with variable block: eg P–P–P–QRS–P–P–QRS (3:1 block then 2:1 block). The atrial rhythm is regular but the ventricular rhythm (hence pulse) is irregular. • Multifocal atrial tachycardia: like focal atrial tachycardia but there are multiple groups of atrial cells taking it in turns to initiate a cardiac cycle. P-wave morphol- ogy and P-P intervals vary. Usually associated with
