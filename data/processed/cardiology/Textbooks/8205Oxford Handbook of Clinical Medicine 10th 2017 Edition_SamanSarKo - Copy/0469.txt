If used more than once daily, or night-time symptoms, go to Step 2. • Step 2: Add standard-dose inhaled steroid, eg beclometasone 200–800mcg/day, or start at the dose appropriate for disease severity, and titrate as required. • Step 3: Add long-acting 2-agonist (eg salmeterol 50mcg/12h by inhaler). If bene- fi t—but still inadequate control—continue and dose of beclometasone to 800mcg/ day. If no eff ect then stop LABA and dose of beclometasone to 800mcg/day. Leu- kotriene receptor antagonist or oral theophylline may be tried. • Step 4: Consider trials of: beclometasone up to 2000mcg/day; modifi ed-release oral theophylline; modifi ed-release oral 2-agonist tablets; oral leukotriene receptor an- tagonist, in conjunction with previous therapy. • Step 5: Add regular oral prednisolone (1 dose daily, at the lowest possible dose). Continue with high-dose inhaled steroids. Refer for specialist input. Drugs 2-adrenoceptor agonists: Relax bronchial smooth muscle (CAMP), acting within minutes. Salbutamol is best given by inhalation (aerosol, powder, nebulizer), but may also be given PO or IV. SE: tachyarrhythmias, K+, tremor, anxiety.
