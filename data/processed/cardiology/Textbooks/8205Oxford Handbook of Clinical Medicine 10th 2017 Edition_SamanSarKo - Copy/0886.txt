HbS should be reduced to <30%. • Inform their haematologist of admission early. The acute chest syndrome: Entails pulmonary infi ltrates involving complete lung segments, causing pain, fever, tachypnoea, wheeze, and cough. It is serious. Inci- dence: ~0.1 episodes/patient/yr. 13% in the landmark Vichinsky study needed ven- tilation, 11% had CNS symptoms, and 9% of those over 20 years old died. Prodromal painful crisis occur ~2.5 days before any abnormalities on CXR in 50% of patients. The chief causes of the infi ltrates are fat embolism from bone marrow or infection with Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, or viruses. : O2, analgesia, empirical antibiotics (cephalosporin + macrolide) until culture results known. Bronchodilators (eg sal- butamol, p182) have proved to be eff ective in those with wheezing or obstructive pulmonary function at presentation. Blood transfusion (exchange if severe). Take to ITU if Pa O2 cannot be kept above 9.2kPa (70mmHg) when breathing air. Patient-controlled analgesia is a good option if supportive measures and oral analgesia do not control pain. Start with morphine 1mg/kg in 50mL 5% glucose (paediatric dose) and try a rate of 1mL/h, allowing the patient to deliver extra boluses of 1mL when needed. Check respiratory rate and GCS every ¼h +
