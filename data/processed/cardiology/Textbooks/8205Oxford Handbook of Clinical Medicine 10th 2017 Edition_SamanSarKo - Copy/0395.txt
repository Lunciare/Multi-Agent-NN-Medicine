of prosthetic valves: systemic embolism, infective endocarditis, haemolysis, structural valve failure, arrhythmias. CABG See p123. Cardiac transplantation Consider this when cardiac disease is severely curtailing quality of life, and survival is not expected beyond 6–12 months. Surgery for congenital heart defects See p156. Aortic root surgery Replacement/repair if dissection or aneurysmal. 5 Remember that it is the tricuspid valve which is the valve most vulnerable to events arriving by vein, eg pathogens from IV drug abusers or hormones (particularly 5-HT) from carcinoid tumours. 6 Souttar’s own description of this landmark case is available online: H S Souttar.
