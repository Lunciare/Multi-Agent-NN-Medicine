features of ‘refeeding syndrome’, which include: rhab- domyolysis; red and white cell dysfunction; respiratory insuffi ciency; arrhythmias; cardiogenic shock; seizures; sudden death. Prevention Give high-dose Pabrinex ® during re-feeding window. Identify at-risk patients, assess and monitor closely during refeeding (glucose, lipids, sodium, po- tassium, phosphate, calcium, magnesium, and zinc). Close involvement of a nutri- tionist is required. Treatment is of the complicating features and includes parenteral phosphate ad- ministration (eg 18mmol/d) in addition to oral supplementation. The venous system at the thoracic outlet When trying to judge the position of a central venous line tip on CXR (see fi g 13.10) it helps to know the anatomical landmarks of the venous system (fi g 13.9). The subclavian veins join the inter- nal jugular veins behind the sternoclav- icular joints to form the brachiocephalic veins. These come together behind the right 1st sternocostal joint to form the superior vena cava (SVC), which runs from this point to the right 3rd sterno- costal joint. The right atrium starts here.
