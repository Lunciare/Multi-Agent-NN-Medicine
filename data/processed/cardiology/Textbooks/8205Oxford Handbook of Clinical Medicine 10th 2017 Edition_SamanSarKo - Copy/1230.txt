transthoracic. • Carotid artery stenosis. Do carotid Doppler US ± CT/MRI angiography. Benefi ts and risks of revascularization should be individualized by an expert but generally most with ≥ 70% stenosis and life expectancy ≥ 5yrs will benefi t while some (especially ) will benefi t with 50–69% stenosis7 (see p476). Carotid endarterectomy is the procedure of choice; endovascular carotid artery angioplasty with stenting is an alternative for those unfi t for surgery and achieves similar long-term outcomes but has higher peri-procedure stroke and mortality rates. • Hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia, and hyperhomocysteinaemia. • Vasculitis. ESR, ANCA (p556). VDRL to look for active, untreated syphilis (p412). • Prothrombotic states, eg thrombophilia (p374), antiphospholipid syndrome (p554). • Hyperviscosity, eg polycythaemia (p366), sickle-cell disease (p340). • Thrombocytopenia and other bleeding disorders. • Genetic tests. CADASIL (p470); Fabry disease (p698). Prognosis Overall mortality: 60 000/yr; UK 20% at 1 month, then 10%/yr. Full recov- ery: ≤ 40%. Drows i ness ≈ poor prognosis. Avoid pressure ulcers (fi g 10.16). 7 Interventions for 50–69% stenoses can be justifi able; individualize risk and check local guidelines. In particular, check which criteria used to estimate degree of stenosis since NASCET (North American Sympto- matic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial)
