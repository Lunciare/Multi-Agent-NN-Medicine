  shock can result from inadequate CO or a loss of SVR, or both. Inadequate cardiac output • Hypovolaemia: • Bleeding: trauma, ruptured aortic aneurysm, GI bleed. • Fluid loss: vomiting, burns, ‘third-space’ losses, eg pancreatitis, heat exhaustion. • Pump failure: • Cardiogenic shock, eg ACS, arrhythmias, aortic dissection, acute valve failure. • Secondary causes, eg PE, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade. Peripheral circulatory failure (loss of SVR) • Sepsis: (p792) Infection with any organism can cause acute vasodilation from infl ammatory cytokines. Gram –ves can produce endotoxin, causing sudden and severe shock but without signs of infection (fever,  WCC). Classically patients with sepsis are warm & vasodilated, but may be cold & shut down. Other diseases, eg pancreatitis, can give a similar picture associated with the infl ammatory cascade. • Anaphylaxis: p794. • Neurogenic: Eg spinal cord injury, epidural or spinal anaesthesia. • Endocrine failure: Addison’s disease, p836 or hypothyroidism; see p834. • Other: Drugs, eg anaesthetics, antihypertensives, cyanide poisoning. Assessment ABCDE (p779). With shock we are dealing primarily with ‘C ’ so get large-bore IV access ≈2 and check ECG for rate, rhythm (very fast or very slow will compromise cardiac output), and signs of ischaemia. •
