Image courtesy of Dr Elen Thomson, Leeds Teaching Hospitals. Fig 16.7 Knowing where lines and tubes should be placed is an essential skill. An ET tube (orange) should sit 3–7cm above the carina; this one is slightly high. The tip of the CVC (red, here a right internal jugular line) should lie in the SVC, as seen here, or just in the right atrium. The tip of the NG tube (green) must be seen below the diaphragm to ensure it is placed in the oesophagus, not the trachea. Do not confuse external leads (blue) with internal lines. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 772277 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygoloidaR 728 Plain abdominal x-ray These are rarely diagnostic and involve a radiation dose equivalent to 50 CXRS.
