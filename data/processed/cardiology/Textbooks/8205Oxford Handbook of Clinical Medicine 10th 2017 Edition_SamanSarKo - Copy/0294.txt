breath hold with very low radiation doses. It can diagnose signifi cant (>50%) stenosis in coronary artery disease with an accuracy of 89%. CT coronary angiography has a negative predictive value of >99%, which makes it an eff ective non-invasive alternative to routine transcatheter coronary angiography to rule out coronary artery disease.6 Medications are often given to slow the heart down and the imaging may be ‘gated’, meaning the scanner is programmed to take images at times corresponding to certain points on the patient’s ECG. This allows characterization of the heart at diff erent points in the cardiac cycle. See p740. Cardiac MR A radiation-free method of characterizing cardiac structure and func- tion including viability of myocardium. By varying the settings, diff erent defects can be found. MR is the fi rst-choice imaging method to look at diseases that directly af- fect the myocardium (fi g 3.16). Nowadays, pacemakers are available which are safe for MR scanning—check MR safety with your cardiac technicians before requesting MR for patients with pacemakers in situ. See p740. Nuclear imaging Perfusion is assessed at rest and with exercise- or pharmacolog- ically-induced stress. This test is particularly useful for assessing whether myocar- dium distal to
