DI •Idiopathic (50%). •Congenital: defects in ADH gene, DIDMOAD.16 •Tumour (may present with DI + hypopituitarism): craniopharyn gioma, metastases, pituitary tumour. •Trauma: temporary if distal to pituitary stalk as proximal nerve endings grow out to fi nd capillaries in scar tissue and begin direct secretion again. •Hypophysectomy. •Autoimmune hypophysitis (p232). •Infi ltration: histiocytosis, sarcoid o sis.17 •Vascular: haemorrhage.18 •Infection: meningoencephalitis. Causes of nephrogenic DI •Inherited. •Metabolic: low potassium, high calcium. •Drugs: lithium, demeclocycline. •Chronic renal disease. •Post-obstructive uropathy. Tests U&E, Ca2+, glucose (exclude DM), serum and urine osmolalities. Serum osmo l ality estimate ≈ 2 ≈ (Na+ + K+) + urea + glucose (all in mmol/L). Normal plasma osmolality is 285–295mOsmol/kg, and urine can be concentrated to more than twice this concentra- tion. Signifi cant DI is excluded if urine to plasma (U:P) osmolality ratio is more than 2:1, provided plasma osmolality is no greater than 295mOsmol/kg. In DI, despite raised plasma osmolality, urine is dilute with a U:P ratio <2. In primary polydipsia there may be dilutional hyponatraemia—and as hyponatraemia may itself cause mania, be cautious of saying ‘It’s water intoxication from psychogenic polydipsia’. Diagnosis Water deprivation test: See BOX ‘The 8-hour water deprivation test’. NB: it is often
