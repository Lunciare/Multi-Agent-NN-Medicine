Nodular lesions may be amelanotic in ~5%. Others: acral melanomas occur on palms, soles, and subungual areas; lentigo maligna melanoma evolves from pre-exisiting lentigo maligna. Breslow thickness (depth in mm), tumour stage, and presence of ulceration are important prognostic factors. : urgent excision can be cu- rative. Chemotherapy gives a response in 10–30% with metastatic disease (OHCS p592). Ipilimumab, a human monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4, an inhibitory T-cell re- ceptor, has been shown to improve survival in patients with metastatic melanoma.5,6 2 Squamous cell cancer: Usually presents as an ulcerated lesion, with hard, raised edges, in sun-exposed sites. May begin in solar keratoses (see later in topic), or be found on the lips of smokers or in long-standing ulcers (=Marjolin’s ulcer). Metastasis to lymph nodes is rare, local destruction may
