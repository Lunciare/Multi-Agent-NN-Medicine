to pick off the lower cranial nerves one by one. • I: Trauma; respiratory tract infection; meningitis; frontal lobe tumour. • II: Field defects may start as small areas of visual loss (scotomas, eg in glaucoma). Monocular blindness—lesions of one eye or optic nerve eg MS, giant cell arteritis. Bilateral blindness4—any cause of mononeuritis, eg diabetes, MS; rarely methanol, neurosyphilis. Field defects—bitemporal hemianopia—optic chiasm compres- sion, eg pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, internal carotid artery aneurysm (fi g 10.3, p451). Homonymous hemianopia—aff ects half the visual fi eld contralat- eral to the lesion in each eye. Lesions lie beyond the chiasm in the tracts, radiation, or occipital cortex, eg stroke, abscess, tumour. Optic neuritis (pain on moving eye, loss of central vision, relative aff erent pupillary defect, disc swelling from papillitis5)—causes demyelination (eg MS); rarely sinusitis, syphilis, collagen vas- cular disorders. Ischaemic papillopathy—swelling of optic disc due to stenosis of the posterior ciliary artery (eg in giant cell arteritis). Papilloedema (bilateral- ly swollen discs, fi g 12.20, p560)—most commonly ICP (tumour, abscess, enceph- alitis, hydrocephalus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension); rarer: retro-orbital lesion (eg cavernous sinus thrombosis, p480). Optic atrophy (pale optic discs and reduced acuity)—MS; frontal tumours; Friedreich’s ataxia; retinitis pigmen- tosa; syphilis;
