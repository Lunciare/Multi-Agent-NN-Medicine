MRI is used in the assessment of multif ocal/bilateral disease and patients with cosmetic implants who are identifi ed as high risk. Sentinel node biopsy Decreases needless axillary clearances in lymph node Ωve patients. • Patent blue dye and/or radiocolloid injected into periareolar area or tumour. • A gamma probe/visual inspection is used to identify the sentinel node. • The sentinel node is biopsied and sent for histology ± immunohisto chemistry; further clearance only if sentinel node +ve. Sentinel node identifi ed in 90%. False Ωve rates <5% for experienced surgeons. Prognostic factors in breast cancer Tumour size, grade, lymph node status, ER/PR
