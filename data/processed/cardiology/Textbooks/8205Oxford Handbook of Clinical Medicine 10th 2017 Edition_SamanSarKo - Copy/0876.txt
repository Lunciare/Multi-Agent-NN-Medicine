on the fi lm. • Hb electrophoresis will detect haemoglobinopathies. • The direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT, fi g 8.28) identifi es red cells coated with antibody or complement, the presence of which indicates an immune cause. • Enzyme assays are reserved for when other causes have been excluded. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 333366 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH 337 Fig 8.28 The direct Coombs test detects antibodies on RBCS. The indirect Coombs test is used in pre-natal testing and before blood transfusion. It detects antibodies against RBCs that are free in serum: serum is incubated with RBCS of known antigenicity. If agglutination occurs, the indirect Coombs test is positive.

Classify accord- ing to optimal binding temperature to RBCs: Warm AIHA: IgG-mediated, bind at body T° 37°C. : Steroids/immunosuppressants (± splenectomy). Cold AIHA: IgM-mediated, bind at T° (<4°C), activating cell-surface complement.
