(may be paroxysmal if aspiration pneu- monia). : See ‘Dysphagia’, p250. Tests Oesophagoscopy with biopsy is the investigation of choice ± EUS, CT/MRI for stag- ing (fi g 13.35), or laparoscopy if signifi cant infra-diaphragmatic component. Staging: See table 13.14. Treatment Survival rates are poor with or without treatment. If localized T1/T2 disease, radical curative oesophagectomy may be tried. Pre-op chemotherapy (cis- platin + fl uorouracil) for localized disease may improve survival, but causes some morbidity. If surgery is not indicated, then chemor adiotherapy may be better than radiotherapy alone. Palliation in advanced disease aims to restore swallowing with chemo/radiotherapy, stenting, and laser use. TNM staging in oesophageal cancer Spread of oesophageal cancer is direct, by submucosal infi ltration and local spread—or to nodes, or, later, via the blood.
