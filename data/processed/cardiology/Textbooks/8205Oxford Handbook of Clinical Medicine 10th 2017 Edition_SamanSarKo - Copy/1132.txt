Caused by blood-fl ukes (trematode worms) of the genus Schistosoma (table 9.27). 258 million people in 78 countries required treatment in 2014. The life cycle is shown in fi g 9.44. Disease develops after contact with contaminated freshwater (swim- ming, washing). Symptoms are due to an immune complex response to the migrating parasite (Katayama syndrome), or deposition of parasite eggs in body tissues. Presentation: ~50% asymptomatic or non-specifi c symptoms. Clinical syndromes: • Larval penetration: pruritic papular rash (‘swimmer’s itch’). • Migration of schistosomules: Katayama syndrome 2–8wks after exposure: fever, urticaria, diarrhoea,cough,wheeze, hepatos plenomegaly, eosinophilia. • Host response to egg deposition: • Intestinal disease: pain, diarrhoea, blood in stool, (granulomatous) hepatomeg- aly, splenomegaly. Heavy chronic infection can cause bowel perforation, hyper- plasia, polyposis, liver fi brosis, portal hypertensionvarices. • Urogenital disease: haematuria, dysuria, ureteric fi brosishydronephrosis, CKD, bladder fi brosis/cancer, genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, dyspareunia, vulval nodules, haemospermia, prostatitis. • Lung disease: pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. • CNS disease: rare, acute lower limb paraplegia, transverse (‘traveller’s’) myelitis. Diagnosis: Ova
