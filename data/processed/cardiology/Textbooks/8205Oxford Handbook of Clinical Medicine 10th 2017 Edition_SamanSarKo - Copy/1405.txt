button or picking up a coin. Legs: Observe legs: normal quadriceps bulk? Any swelling or deformity? With pa- tient lying supine: any leg length discrepancy? Internally/externally rotate each hip in fl exion. Passively fl ex knee and hip to the full extent. Is movement limited? Any crepitus? Find any knee effusion using the patella tap test. If there is fl uid, consider aspirating and testing for crystals or infection. With patient standing: observe feet: any deformity? Are arches high or fl at? Any callosities? These may indicate an ab- normal gait of some chronicity. Squeeze across metatarsophalangeal joints: see as for arms. Also: although not in the GALS system, palpate the heel and Achilles tendon to identify plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendonitis often associated with seronega- tive rheumatological conditions. Examine the patient’s shoes for signs of uneven wear. Gait: Observe walking: is the gait smooth? Good arm swing? Stride length OK? Nor- mal heel strike and toe off ? Can they turn quickly? Range of joint movement Is noted in degrees, with anatomical position being the neutral position—eg elbow fl exion 0°–150° normally, but with fi xed fl exion and lim- ited movement, range may be reduced to 30°–90°.
