meal, accidental or non-accidental overdose (check for ciculating oral hypoglycaemics). In non-diabetics you must EXPLAIN mechanism: Exogenous drugs, eg insulin, oral hypoglycaemics (p208)? access through diabetic in the family? Body-builders may misuse insulin to help stamina. Also: alcohol, eg a binge with no food; aspirin poisoning; ACE-i; -blockers; pentamidine; quinine sulfate; aminoglutethamide; insulin-like growth factor.14 Pituitary insuffi ciency. Liver failure, plus some rare inherited enzyme defects. Addison’s disease. Islet cell tumours (insulinoma) and immune hypoglycaemia (eg anti-insulin receptor antibodies in Hodgkin’s disease). Non-pancreatic neoplasms, eg fi brosarcomas and haema ngiopericytomas. When to investigate: • Whipple answered this (Whipple’s triad): symptoms or signs of hypoglycemia + plasma glucose + resolution of symptoms or signs post glucose rise. • Document BM during attack and lab glucose if in hospital (monitors often not reli- able at low readings). • Take a drug history and exclude liver failure. • 72h fasting may be needed (monitor closely). Bloods: glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and plasma ketones if symptomatic. If endogenous hyperinsulinism suspected, do insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, -hydroxybutyrate. Interpreting results: • Hypoglycaemic hyperinsulinaemia (HH): Causes: insulinoma, sulfonylureas, insulin injection (no detectable C-peptide—only released with endogenous insulin); non- insulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycaemia syndrome, mutation in the insulin-re- ceptor gene.
