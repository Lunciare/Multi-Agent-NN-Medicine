and rhythm. Character and volume are best assessed at the brachial or carotid arteries. A collapsing pulse may also be felt at the radial artery when the patient’s arm is elevated above their head. See fi g 2.10. Rate Is the pulse fast (100bpm, p126) or slow (60bpm, p124)? Rhythm An irregularly irregular pulse occurs in AF or multiple ectopics. A regularly irregular pulse occurs in 2° heart block and ventricular bigeminus. Character and volume • Bounding pulses are caused by CO2 retention, liver failure, and sepsis. • Small volume pulses occur in aortic stenosis, shock, and pericardial eff usion. • Collapsing (‘waterhammer’) pulses are caused by aortic incompetence, AV mal- formations, and a patent ductus arteriosus. • Anacrotic (slow-rising) pulses occur in aortic stenosis. • Bisferiens pulses occur in combined aortic stenosis and regurgitation. • Pulsus alternans (alternating strong and weak beats) suggests LVF, cardio- myopathy, or aortic stenosis. • Jerky pulses occur in H(O)CM. • Pulsus paradoxus (systolic pressure weakens in inspiration by >10mmHg) occurs in severe asthma, pericardial constriction, or cardiac tamponade. Peripheral pulses (See p36.) See p771 for arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling. Waterhammer pulse The waterhammer was a popular toy that consisted of a vacuum
