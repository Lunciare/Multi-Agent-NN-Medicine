valve prolapse may produce a late systolic murmur ± midsystolic click. • Early diastolic murmurs (EDMs) are high pitched and easily missed: listen for the ‘absence of silence’ in early diastole. An EDM occurs in aortic and, though rare, pul- monary regurgitation. If the pulmonary regurgitation is secondary to pulmonary hypertension resulting from mitral stenosis, then the EDM is called a Graham Steell murmur. • Mid-diastolic murmurs (MDMs) are low pitched and rumbling. They occur in mitral stenosis (accentuated presystolically if heart still in sinus rhythm), rheumatic fever (Carey Coombs’ murmur: due to thickening of the mitral valve leafl ets), and aortic regurgitation (Austin Flint murmur: due to the fl uttering of the anterior mitral valve cusp caused by the regurgitant stream). Intensity All murmurs are graded on a scale of 1–6 (see table 2.4), though in practice diastolic murmurs, being less loud, are only graded 1–4. Intensity is a poor guide to the severity of a lesion—an ESM may be inaudible in severe aortic stenosis. Area where loudest Though an unreliable sign, mitral murmurs tend to be loudest over the apex, in contrast to the area of greatest intensity from lesions of the aortic (right 2nd intercostal space), pulmonary
