value of 100% for both PKD1 and PKD2 mutations. Sensitivity is >93% for PKD1 but only 69% for diagnosis of PKD2 <30 years. Liver (90% by age 50) and pancreatic cysts (~10%) support the diagnosis. Genetic testing available but ~1500 diff erent mu- tations are described so use limited to diagnostic uncertainty, potential donors, and pre-implantation diagnosis. (Non-contrast) CT for renal colic as cysts obscure view on USS. Screening for intracranial aneurysms (MRI) recommended for age <65yrs if personal/family history of aneurysm/SAH. Treatment: Water intake 3–4L/day (if eGFR >30) may suppress cyst growth. BP should be treated to target <130/80mmHg: 1st- line ACE-i/ARB, 2nd-line thiazide-like, 3rd-line -blocker (not calcium channel blocker as Ca2+ entry is part of pathology although no specifi c outcome data). Treat infec- tion. Haematuria usually managed conservatively. Persistent/severe pain may need cyst decompression. Plan for RRT including pre-emptive transplantation. Ongoing re- search evaluating drugs which inhibit cyst growth including vasopressin antagonists (tolvaptan: decrease in kidney volume seen), somatostatin analogues, metformin, and transcription inhibitors. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease 1 in 20 000, chromosome 6. Presents ante/perinatally with renal cysts (‘salt and pep- per’ appearance on USS), congenital hepatic fi brosisportal hypertension. Poor prog- nosis if neonatal
