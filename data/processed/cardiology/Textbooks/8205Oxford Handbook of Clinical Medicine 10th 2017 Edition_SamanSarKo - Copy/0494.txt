Eff usions can be divided by their protein concentration into transudates (<25g/L) and exudates (>35g/L), see BOX. Blood in the pleural space is a haemothorax, pus in the pleural space is an em- pyema, and chyle (lymph with fat) is a chylothorax. Both blood and air in the pleural space is called a haemopneumothorax. Causes Transudates may be due to venous pressure (cardiac failure, constrictive pericarditis, fl uid overload), or hypoproteinaemia (cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, mal- absorption). Also occur in hypothyroidism and Meigs’ syndrome (right pleural eff usion and ovarian fi broma). Exudates are mostly due to increased leakiness of pleural cap- illaries secondary to infection, infl ammation, or malignancy. Causes: pneumonia; TB; pulmonary infarction; rheumatoid arthritis; SLE; bronchogenic carcin oma; malignant metastases; lymphoma; mesothelioma; lymphangitis carcinomatosis. Symptoms Asymptomatic—or dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain. Signs Decreased expansion; stony dull percussion note; diminished breath sounds occur on the aff ected side. Tactile vocal fremitus and vocal resonance are  (incon- stant and unreliable). Above the eff usion, where lung is compressed, there may be bronchial breathing. With large eff usions
