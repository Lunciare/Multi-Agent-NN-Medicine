and secondary infl ammation. Seen in tumour lysis syndrome when a high tumour burden and sensitivity to chemotherapy cause uric acid which precipitates in association with phosphate. In addition, serum uric acid is a risk factor for CKD: hypothesized stimulus for arterial disease with pathological autoregu- lation of renal blood fl ow, renin, and BP. Treatment: Tumour lysis: aggressive hy- dration, allopurinol/rasburicase to synthesis of uric acid. Chronic disease: unclear whether diet/treatment to uric acid (allopurinol, febuxostat) improves outcome. Radiation nephritis Renal impairment due to ionizing radiation. Presents 6 months–years after total body irradiation, local fi eld radiotherapy, or targeted radionucleotide therapy. Presents with BP, proteinuria/haematuria, progression to renal failure. Prognosis linked to BP. Treatment: Radiation dose with shielding. As CKD (pp304–5) with strict BP control. Aristolochic acid nephropathy Herbal remedies containing aristolochic acid can cause progressive CKD. Dispropor- tionate anaemia, mild proteinuria, and renal dysfunction. Biopsy: extensive fi brosis and tubular atrophy. Risk of urothelial malignancy ≈5, occurs in up to 40%. Aris- tolochic acid thought to be underlying cause of Balkan endemic nephropathy: clus- ter of CKD/renal failure in Balkan areas where aristolochic acid is detected in wheat. Treatment: Avoid exposure. Treat as CKD (pp304–5). Screen for malignancy.
