theophylline, aspirin, allopurinol, vitamin C and D, indinavir. Are there any predisposing factors? For example: • Recurrent UTIS (in magnesium ammonium phosphate calculi). • Metabolic abnormalities: • Hypercalciuria/hypercalcaemia (p676): hyperparathyroidism, neoplasia, sarc oido sis, hyperthyroidism, Addison’s, Cushing’s, lithium, vitamin D excess. • Hyperuricosuria/plasma urate: on its own, or with gout. • Hyperoxaluria. • Cystinuria (p321). • Renal tubular acidosis (pp316–7). • Urinary tract abnormalities: eg pelviureteric junction obstruction, hydro- nephrosis (renal pelvis or calyces), calyceal diverticulum, horseshoe kidney, ureterocele, vesicoureteric refl ux, ureteral stricture, medullary sponge kidney.11 • Foreign bodies: eg stents, catheters. Is there a family history? Risk of stones 3-fold. Specifi c diseases include X-linked nephrolithiasis and Dent’s disease (proteinuria, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis). Is there infection above the stone? Eg fever, loin tender, pyuria? This needs urgent intervention. Fig 13.46 Calcium oxalate Fig 13.47 Struvite stone. Fig 13.48 Cystine stone. monohydrate. Image courtesy of Dr Glen Austin. Image courtesy of Dr Glen Austin.
