the thyroid gland itself, and rarely caused by the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary. TRH from the hypothalamus acts on the pituitary gland Fig 5.12 Pathways involved in thyroid function. Basic tests See table 5.2. Free T4 and T3 are more useful than total T4 and T3 as the latter are aff ected by TBG. Total T4 and T3 are  when TBG is  and vice versa. TBG is  in pregnancy, oestrogen therapy (HRT, oral contraceptives), and hepatitis. TBG is  in nephrotic syndrome and malnutrition (both from protein loss), drugs (androgens, cortico steroids, phenytoin), chronic liver disease, and acromegaly. TSH is very useful: • Hyperthyroidism suspected: Ask for T3, T4, and TSH. All will have TSH (except the rare TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma). Most have T4, but ~1% have only raised T3. • Hypothyroidism suspected or monitoring replacement : Ask for only T4 and TSH. T3 does not add any extra information. TSH varies through the day: trough at 2PM; 30% higher during darkness, so during monitoring, try to do at the same time. Sick euthyroidism: In any systemic illness, TFTS may become deranged. The typical pattern is for ‘everything to be low’. The test should be repeated
