(p742) and biopsy if cholangiocarcinoma is suspected. Liver biopsy: (See p248.) May achieve a histological diagnosis; careful multidisciplinary discussion is required if potentially resectable, as bleeding or seeding along the bi- opsy tract can occur. If the lesion could be a metastasis, fi nd the primary, eg by CXR, mammography, colono scopy, CT, MRI, or marrow biopsy. Liver metastases Signify advanced disease. Treatment and prognosis vary with the type and extent of primary tumour. Chemotherapy may be eff ective (eg lympho- mas, germ cell tumours). Small, solitary metastases may be amenable to resection (eg colorectal cancer). In most, treatment is palliative. Prognosis: Often <6 months. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) Primary hepatocyte neoplasia accounts for 90% of primary liver cancers; it is common in China & Africa (40% of cancers vs 2% in UK). The patient: Fatigue, appetite, RUQ pain, weight, jaundice, ascites, haemobilia.34 : ≈ 3. Causes: HBV is the leading cause worldwide (esp. if high viral load; p278). HCV;35 AIH (p284); cirrhosis (alcohol, haemochrom atosis, PBC); non-alcoholic fatty liver; afl atox- in; Clonorchis sinensis; anabolic steroids. : 3-phase CT (delayed wash-out of contrast in a suspect mass); MRI; biopsy. Treatment: Resecting solitary tumours <3cm across  3yr survival from 13%
