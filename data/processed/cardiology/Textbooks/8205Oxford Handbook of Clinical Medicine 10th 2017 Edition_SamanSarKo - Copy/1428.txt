seen in juxta-articular bone (see fi g 12.6 on p541). There is no sclerotic reaction, and joint spaces are preserved until late. Treatment of acute gout High-dose NSAID (see BOX, p545) or if CI use colchicine (500mcg BD) which is eff ective but slower to work (BNF states max 6mg per course although rheumatologists will often use more).33 NB: in renal impairment, NSAIDS and colchicine are problematic. Steroids (oral, IM, or intra-articular) may also be used.34 Rest and elevate joint. Ice packs and ‘bed cages’ can be eff ective. Prevention Lose weight, avoid prolonged fasts, alcohol excess, purine-rich meats, and low-dose aspirin. Prophylaxis: Start if >1 attack in 12 months, tophi, or renal stones. The aim is to  attacks and prevent damage caused by crystal deposition. Use allopurinol and titrate from 100mg/24h, increasing every 4 weeks until plasma urate <0.3mmol/L (max 300mg/8h). SE: rash, fever, WCC. Allopurinol may trigger an attack so wait 3 weeks after an acute episode, and cover with regular NSAID (for up to 6 weeks) or colchicine (0.5mg/12h PO for up to 6 months). Avoid stopping allopurinol in acute attacks once established. Febuxostat (80mg/24h) is an alternative if allopuri- nol is CI or not tolerated.
