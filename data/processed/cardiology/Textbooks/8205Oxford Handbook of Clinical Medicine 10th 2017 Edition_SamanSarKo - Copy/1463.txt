vasculature may cause retinal artery occlusion (global or segmental retinal pallor) or amaurosis fugax (p476). Roth spots (small retinal infarcts occur in infective endocarditis. In der- matomyositis, there is orbital oedema with retinopathy showing cotton-wool spots (micro-infarcts). Retinal vein occlusion is caused by BP, age, or hyperviscosity (p372). Suspect in any acute fall in acuity. If it is the central vein, the fundus is like a stormy sunset (those angry red clouds are haemorrhages). In branch vein occlusion, changes are confi ned to a wedge of retina. Get expert help. Haematological disorders Retinal haemorrhages occur in leukaemia; comma- shaped conjunctival haemorrhages and retinal new vessel formation may occur in sickle-cell disease. Optic atrophy is seen in pernicious anaemia (and also MS). Metabolic disease Diabetes mellitus: p210. Hyperthyroid exophthalmos: p219. Lens opacities are seen in hypoparathyroidism. Conjunctival and corneal calcifi cation can occur in hypercalcaemia. In gout, conjunctival urate deposits may cause sore eyes. Systemic infections Septicaemia may seed to the vitreous causing endophtha l- mitis. Syphilis can cause iritis (+ pigmented retinopathy if congenital). Systemic fun- gal infections may aff ect the eye, eg in the immunocompromised or in IV drug users, requiring intra-vitreal antibiotics. AIDS and HIV CMV retinitis
