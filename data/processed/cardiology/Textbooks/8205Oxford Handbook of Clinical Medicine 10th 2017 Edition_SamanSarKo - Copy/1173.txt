neurotransmitters. If so, it is surely a seascape of exquisite beauty, no matter how disturbed cognition may become by the storms that whip the waves on the surface. A well-chosen prescription may off er a lifeboat from such storms, but before prescribing any drug that modu- lates neurotransmission, consider that you are about to release a blunt and poorly understood force into a delicate environment. • The drug (or a metabolite) must be able to pass through the blood–brain barrier to have an eff ect. •The conse- quences of any sedative eff ects may be severe. • There will be short- and long- term SEs (eg tardive dyskinesia with neuroleptic drugs). • Most drugs aff ect many neuro transmitters, increasing therapeutic scope (and uncertainty) eg risperidone (blocks D2, 5HT2, 1 and 2 receptors). • Metabolites of drugs may have equal or more important pharmacological eff ects resulting in clinically important interactions with drugs aff ecting eg hepatic metabolism. • One neurotrans mitter may have many eff ects, eg dopaminergic neurons go awry in Parkinson’s disease, schizo- phrenia, and addiction to drugs and gambling, by aff ecting motor control, motiva- tion, eff ort, reward, analgesia, stress, learning, attention, and cognition. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb
