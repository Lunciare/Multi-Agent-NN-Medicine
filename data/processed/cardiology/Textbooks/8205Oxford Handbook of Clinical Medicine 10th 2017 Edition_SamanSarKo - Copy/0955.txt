Regular IV immunoglobulin infusions may be needed if recurrent. Chemotherapy: Induction therapy with, eg lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexa- methasone. In suitably fi t patients this may be followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation. In those unsuitable for transplantation, induction therapy is typi- cally continued for 12–18 months, or until serum paraprotein levels have plateaued. Treatment is then typically held until (inevitably) paraprotein levels start to rise again, at which point further chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation may be considered. NB: lenalidomide is a teratogenic immunomodulator which has multiple SE, notably neutropenia and thromboembolism: monitor for sepsis and consider as- pirin or anticoagulation if risk , eg hyperviscosity or other comorbidities. Prognosis Worse if: >2 osteolytic lesions, 2-microglobulin >5.5mg/L, Hb <11g/L; albumin <30g/L. Risk stratifi cation increasingly based upon detection of specifi c cytogenetic abnormalities associated with high risk of progression. Causes of death: infection, renal failure. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 336688 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH Myeloma diagnosis Causes of bone pain/tenderness 369 Have a high index of suspicion, eg in • Trauma/fracture (steroids risk) bone pain or back pain which is not • Myeloma and other primary malig- improving.
