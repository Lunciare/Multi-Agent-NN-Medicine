primarily with ‘C ’ so get large-bore IV access ≈2 and check ECG for rate, rhythm (very fast or very slow will compromise cardiac output), and signs of ischaemia. • General review: Cold and clammy suggests cardiogenic shock or fl uid loss. Look for signs of anaemia or dehydration, eg skin turgor, postural hypotension? Warm and well perfused, with bounding pulse points to septic shock. Any features sug- gestive of anaphylaxis—history, urticaria, angioedema, wheeze? • CVS: Usually tachycardic (unless on -blocker, or in spinal shock—OHCS p757) and hypotensive. But in the young and fi t, or pregnant women, the systolic BP may remain normal, although the pulse pressure will narrow, with up to 30% blood volume depletion. Diff erence between arms (>20mmHg)—aortic dissection (p655)? • JVP or central venous pressure: If raised, cardiogenic shock likely. • Check abdomen: Any signs of trauma, or aneurysm? Any evidence of GI bleed? Management If BP unrecordable, call the cardiac arrest team. • Septic shock: See p792. • Anaphylaxis: See p794. • Cardiogenic shock: See p802. • Hypovolaemic shock: Identify and treat underlying cause. Raise the legs. • Give fl uid bolus 10–15mL/kg crystalloid via large peripheral line, if shock improves, repeat, titrate to
