CT is the standard choice of imaging to assess severity and for complications. US (if gallstones + AST). ERCP if LFTS worsen. CRP >150mg/L at 36h after admission is a predictor of severe pancreatitis. Management Severity assessment is essential (see BOX and table 13.17). • Nil by mouth, consider NJ feeding (decrease pancreatic stimulation). Set up IVI and give lots of crystalloid, to counter third-space sequestration, unt il vital signs are satisfactory and urine fl ow stays at >30mL/h. Insert a urinary catheter and consider CVP monitoring. • Analgesia: pethidine 75–100mg/4h IM, or morphine (may cause Oddi’s sphincter to contract more, but it is a better analgesic and not contraindicated). • Hourly pulse, BP, and urine output; daily FBC, U&E, Ca2+, glucose, amylase, ABG. • If worsening: ITU, O2 if PaO2. In suspected abscess formation or pancreatic ne- crosis (on CT), consider parenteral nutrition ± laparotomy &
