Treatment: supportive. Antibiotics only in invasive cases, refer to local sensitivities (macrolide, doxycycline, quinolone). Salmonella enterocolitis (non-typhoidal): Gram Ωve, anaerobic, motile bacilli. Pres- entation: diarrhoea, cramps, fever, usually within 12–36h of exposure. Invasive infec- tion (<10%) can cause bacteraemia/sepsis, meningitis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis. Diagnosis: stool culture. PCR. Treatment: supportive. Meta-analysis shows no evi- dence of benefi t for antibiotics in healthy people. Consider in severe/extra-intestinal disease according to local sensitivities (quinolone, macrolide). Yersinia enterocolitica: Gram Ωve rod. Presentation: incubation 4–7d. Diarrhoea, fever, pain (may mimic appendicitis), vomiting. May last 1–3wk. Also erythema nodosum, reactive arthritis (~1 month after diarrhoea). Diagnosis: stool culture, agglutination titres. Treatment: antibiotics in severe disease depending on local sen- sitivities (aminoglycosides, co-trimoxazole, quinolone).  See also: Staph. aureus pre-formed toxin (p388), GI parasites (pp432–3), Clostridium diffi cile (p411). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 443311 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 sesaesid suoitcefnI 432 Gastrointestinal parasites Giardiasis Giardia lamblia (fi g 9.38) is a fl agellate protozoan.

Duration of symptoms typically ~2–6wks. Most common diagnosis if persistent travel- ler’s diarrhoea (p429). Diagnosis: Stool microscopy for cysts and troph ozoites.
