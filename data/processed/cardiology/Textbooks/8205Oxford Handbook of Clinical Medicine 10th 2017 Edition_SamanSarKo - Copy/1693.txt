of rupture below this size is <1%/yr, compared to ~25%/yr for aneurysms >6cm across. ~75% of aneurysms under monitoring will eventually need repair. Rup- ture is more likely if: •BP •Smoker • •Positive family history. Modify risk factors if possible at diagnosis. Elective surgery: Reserve for aneurysms ≥5.5cm or expanding at >1cm/yr, or symptomatic aneurysms. Operative mortality: ~5%; complications in- clude spinal or visceral ischaemia and distal emboli from dislodged thrombus debris. Studies show that age >80yrs should not, in itself, preclude surgery. Stenting (EVAR): Major surgery can be avoided by inserting an endovascular stent via the femoral artery. EVAR has less early mortality but higher graft complications, eg failure of stent-graft to totally exclude blood fl ow to the aneurysm—‘endoleak’. See fi g 13.52. Emergency management of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm Mortality—treated: 41% and improving; untreated: ~100%.  Summon a vascular surgeon and an experienced anaesthetist; warn theatre.  Do an ECG, and take blood for amylase, Hb, crossmatch (10–40U may eventually be needed). Catheterize the bladder.  Gain IV access with 2 large-bore cannulae. Treat shock with O RhΩve blood (if not cross matched), but keep systolic BP ≤100mmHg to avoid rupturing a contained leak (NB: raised BP
