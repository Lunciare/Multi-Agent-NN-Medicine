(eg infarcts), haemorrhag- es, venous beading. These are signs of retinal ischaemia. Refer to a specialist. • Proliferative retinopathy: New vessels form. Needs urgent referral. • Maculopathy: (Hard to see in early stages.) Suspect if acuity. Prompt laser, intra vitreal steroids, or anti-angiogenic agents may be needed in macular oedema. Pathogenesis: Capillary endothelial change  vascular leak  microaneurysms  capillary occlusion  local hypoxia + ischae- mia  new vessel formation. High retinal blood fl ow caused by hypergly- caemia (and BP and pregnancy) triggers this, causing capillary pericyte damage. Microvascular occlusion causes cotton-wool spots (± blot haemor- rhages at interfaces with perfused retina). New vessels form on the disc or ischaemic areas, proliferate, bleed, fi brose, and can detach the retina. Aspirin2 (2mg/kg/d) may be recommended by ophthalmologists; there is no evidence that it  bleeding. • Cataracts: May be juvenile ‘snowfl ake’ form, or ‘senile’—which occur earlier in diabetic subjects. Osmotic changes in the lens induced in acute hyperglycaemia reverse with normoglycaemia (so wait before buying glasses). • Rubeosis iridis: New vessels on iris: occurs late and may lead to glaucoma. • Metabolic complications: p832. • Diabetic feet: p212. • Neuropathy: p212. 2 As DM has so
