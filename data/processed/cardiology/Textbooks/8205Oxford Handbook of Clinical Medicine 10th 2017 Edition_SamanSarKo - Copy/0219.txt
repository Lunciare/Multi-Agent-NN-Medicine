Shaking hands can tell you about thyroid disease (warm, sweaty, tremor), anxiety (cold, sweaty), and neurological disease (myotonic dystrophy patients have diffi culty relaxing their grip, a weak grip may suggest muscle wasting or peripheral neuropathy). The nails and skin can inform about systemic disease: Nail abnormalities • Koilonychia (spoon-shaped nails, fi g 2.40) suggests iron defi ciency, haemochromatosis, infection (eg fungal), endocrine disorders (eg acromegaly, hypo- thyroidism), or malnutrition. • Onycholysis (detachment of the nail from the nail- bed) is seen with hypert hyroidism, fungal infection, and psoriasis. • Beau’s lines (fi g 2.41) are transverse furrows from Fig 2.40 Koilonychia. temporary arrest of nail growth at times of biologi- cal stress: severe infection. Nails grow at ~0.1mm/d, the furrow’s distance from the cuticle allows dating of the stress. • Mees’ lines are single white transverse bands clas- sically seen in arsenic
