The glands are controlled by Ωve feedback via Ca2+ levels. PTH acts by: •osteoclast activity releasing Ca2+ and PO43Ω from bones •Ca2+ and PO43Ω reabsorption in the kidney •active 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D3 production is . Overall eff ect is Ca2+ and PO43Ω. Primary hyperparathyroidism Causes: ~80% solitary adenoma, ~20% hyper plasia of all glands, <0.5% parathyroid cancer. Presentation: Often ‘asymp tomatic’ (not in retro- spect!), with Ca2+ on routine tests. Signs relate to: 1 Ca2+ (p676): weak, tired, depressed, thirsty, dehydrated-but-polyuric; also renal stones, abdominal pain, panc reatitis, and ulcers (duodenal : gast ric ≈ 7:1). 2 Bone resorption eff ects of PTH can cause pain, fractures, and osteopenia/osteopo- rosis. 3 BP: so check Ca2+ in everyone with hypertension.
