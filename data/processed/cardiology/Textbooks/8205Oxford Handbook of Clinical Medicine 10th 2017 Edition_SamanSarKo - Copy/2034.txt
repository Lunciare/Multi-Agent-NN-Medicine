Bloods for FBC, U&E, glucose, lipids, troponin (p119, fi g 3.22) Brief assessment: • History of cardiovascular disease; risk factors for IHD • Examination: pulse, BP (both arms), JVP, murmurs, signs of CCF, upper limb pulses, scars from previous cardiac surgery, CXR if will not delay  • Contraindications to PCI or fi brinolysis? Aspirin: 300mg (unless already given by GP/paramedics) Ticagrelor: 180mg (or alternative antiplatelet—see ‘Aspirin’ in text) Morphine: 5–10mg IV + anti-emetic, eg metoclopramide 10mg IV STEMI on ECG and PCI available within 120min? Yes No Primary PCI Fibrinolysis Transfer to primary PCI centre for either rescue PCI if fi brinolysis unsuccessful or for angiography For further management see p120 Fig 19.5 Management of an acute STEMI. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 779977 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 798 Acute coronary syndrome—without ST-elevation First stabilize with medical therapy; early risk stratifi cation will identify those in need of further treatment and prompt angiography (involve cardiologists).4 Assessment Brief history: (See p36.)
