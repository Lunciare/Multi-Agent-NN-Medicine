patients; check ABGS frequently, and consider elective ventilation if rising PaCO2 or worsening acidosis. Aim to keep SaO2 at 94–98%, PaO2 ≥8kPa. Hypotension May be due to a combination of dehydration and vasodilation due to sepsis. If systolic BP is <90mmHg, give an intravenous fl uid challenge of 250mL colloid/crystalloid over 15min. If BP does not rise, consider a central line and give IV fl uids to maintain the systolic BP >90mmHg. If systolic BP remains <90mmHg despite fl uid therapy, request ITU assessment for inotropic support. Atrial fi brillation (p130.) Common in the elderly. It usually resolves with treatment of the pneumonia. -blocker or digoxin may be required to slow the ventricular re- sponse rate in the short term. Pleural eff usion Infl ammation of the pleura by adjacent pneumonia may cause fl uid exudation into the pleural space. If this accumulates faster than it is reabsorbed, a pleural eff usion develops. If small, it may be of no consequence. If larger and patient symptomatic, or infected (empyema), drainage is required (p192, p766). Empyema Pus in the pleural space. It should be suspected if a patient with a resolv- ing pneumonia develops a recurrent fever. Clinical features: CXR indicates
