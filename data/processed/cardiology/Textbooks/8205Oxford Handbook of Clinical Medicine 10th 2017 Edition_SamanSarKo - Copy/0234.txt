or neoplastic disease of the bowel. Nocturia occurs with ‘irritative bladder’, diabetes mellitus, UTI, and reversed diurnal rhythm (seen in renal and cardiac failure). Haematuria (RBC in urine) is due to neoplasia or glomeru- lonephritis (p310) until proven otherwise. Rule out UTI. Voiding diffi culty This includes poor fl ow, straining to void, hesitancy, intermittent stream, incontinence (eg overfl ow), retention (acute or chronic), incomplete emptying (±UTI from residual urine). Remember faecal impaction as a cause of retention with overfl ow. Causes: Obstructive: prostatic hyperplasia, early oedema after bladder neck repair, uterine prolapse, retroverted gravid uterus, fi broids, ovarian cysts, urethral foreign body, ectopic ureterocele, bladder polyp, or cancer. Bladder overdistension—eg after epi- dural for childbirth. Detrusor weakness or myopathy causes incomplete emptying + dribbling overfl ow incontinence (do cystometry/electro myography; causes include neurological disease and interstitial cystitis (OHCS p306); it may lead to a contr acted bladder, eg requiring substitution enterocystoplasty). Drugs: epidural anaesthesia; tricyclics, anticholinergics. CNS: suprapontine (stroke); cord lesions (cord injury, mul- tiple sclerosis); peripheral nerve (prolapsed disc, diabetic or other neuropathy); or refl ex, due to pain (eg with herpes infections). 6 In the elderly, nocturia (1–2/night) may be ‘normal’ because of: i) loss of ability
