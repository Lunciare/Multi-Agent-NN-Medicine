Abnormal LFTS can be found in ~17% of the asymptomatic general population. Also, remember that a normal LFT does not exclude liver disease. Tests of hepatocellular injury or cholestasis Aminotransferases: (AST, ALT) Released in the bloodstream after hepatocellular injury. ALT is more specifi c for hepatocellular injury (but also expressed in kidney and muscle). AST is also expressed in the heart, skeletal muscle, and RBCS. Alkaline phosphatase: May originate from liver, bone (so raised in growing chil- dren) or placenta. Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT; GT): Present in liver, pancreas, renal tubules, and intestine—but not bone, so it helps tell if a raised ALP is from bone (GGT) or liver (GGT). NB: it is not specifi c to alcohol damage to the liver. Tests of hepatic function Serum albumin, serum bilirubin, PT (INR). Hepatocellular predominant liver injury AST & ALT. Evaluate promptly, consid- er medications, collateral history from family (‘Could he be consuming alcohol?’); ultrasound for fatty liver, metastases , viral serology (hepatitis A, B, C, E, EBV, CMV). Alcoholic liver disease: AST/ALT ratio is typically 2:1 or more. When the history is not reliable, normal ALP, GGT, and macrocytosis suggest this condition. Acute viral hepatitis: ALT; bilirubin may be . NB: AST
