Handbook of Clinical medicine

The brain is a gland that secretes both thoughts and molecules: both products are modulated by neurotransmitter systems. Some target sites for drugs: 1 Precursor of the transmitter (eg levodopa). 2 Interference with the storage of transmitter in vesicles within the pre-synaptic neuron (eg tetrabenazine). 3 Binding to the post-synaptic receptor site (eg bromocriptine). 4 Binding to the receptor-modulating site (eg benzodiazepines). 5 Interference with the breakdown of neurotransmitter within the synaptic cleft (eg acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; monoamine oxidase inhibitors—MAOIS). 6 Reduce reuptake of transmitter from synaptic cleft into pre-synaptic cell (eg selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors—SSRIS, eg fl uoxetine; or serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors—SNRIS, eg mirtazapine). 7 Binding to pre-synaptic autoreceptors (eg pindolol, a -blocker with partial 5HT au- toreceptor antagonist eff ects, can be used to augment antidepr essant therapy). Important neurotransmitters (and some associated drugs) are listed in table 10.1. Storms on the sea of neurotransmission The complex and subtle mixture of chemicals that bathes our hundreds of trillions of synapses has been likened to a ‘sea’ of neurotransmitters. If so, it is surely a seascape of exquisite beauty, no matter how disturbed cognition may become by the storms that whip the waves on the surface. A well-chosen
