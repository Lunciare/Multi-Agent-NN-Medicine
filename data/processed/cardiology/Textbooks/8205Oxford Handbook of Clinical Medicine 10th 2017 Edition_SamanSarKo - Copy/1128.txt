• Intestinal amoebiasis: dysentery (often insidious onset/relapsing), pain, colitis, ap- pendicitis, toxic megacolon. Amoeboma = infl ammatory abdominal mass, usually caecal/RIF ± obstruction. • Extra-intestinal (invasive) disease. Amoebic liver abscess in ~1%. Single mass con- taining ‘anchovy-sauce’ pus. High swinging fever, RUQ pain/tenderness. LFT normal or  (cholestatic). 50% have no history of amoebic dysentery. Also peritonitis (rup- ture of colonic abscess), pleuropulmonary abscess, cutaneous/genital lesions. Fig 9.40 The lifecycle of Entamoeba histolytica is in two stages: cysts and trophozoites. Cysts (10–15μm across) typically contain four nuclei (upper right image). During excystation in the gut lumen, nuclear division is followed by cytoplasmic division, giving rise to eight trophozoites. Tropho zoites (10–50μm across) contain one nucleus with a central karyosome (lower right image). Trophozoites inhabit the caecum and colon. Re-encystation of the trophozoites occurs in the colon, and excretion of cysts in faeces perpetuates the lifecycle.
