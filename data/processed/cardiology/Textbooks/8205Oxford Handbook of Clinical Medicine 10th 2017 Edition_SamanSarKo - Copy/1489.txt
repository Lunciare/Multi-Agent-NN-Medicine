Consider use of peri-operative supplemental oxygen. This is a practical method of reducing the incidence of surgical wound infections. • Practise strictly sterile surgical technique. (Ask for a hand with scrubbing up if you are not sure—theatre staff will be more than pleased to help!) Antibiotic regimens Adhere to local guidelines. BNF examples include: • Appendicectomy; colorectal resections and open biliary surgery:A single dose of IV piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5g/8h or gentamicin 1.5mg/kg + metronidazole 500mg or co-amoxiclav 1.2g alone. • Oesophageal or gastric surgery: 1 dose of IV gentamicin or piperacillin/tazo- bactam or co-amoxiclav (doses as for appendicectomy). • Vascular surgery: 1 dose of IV piperacillin/tazobactam or fl ucloxacillin 1–2g + gentamicin. Add metronidazole if risk of anaerobes (eg amputations, gangrene, or diabetes). • MRSA: For high-risk patients add teicoplanin or vancomycin to the above-listed regimens.
