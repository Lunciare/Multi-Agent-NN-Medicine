with peptic ulcer disease. Suspect in those with multiple peptic ulcers, ulcers distal to the duo- denum, or a family history of peptic ulcers (or of islet cell, pituitary, or parathyroid adenomas). Tests: (fi g 15.23) Fasting serum gastrin level (>1000pg/mL). Measure three fasting levels on diff erent days. Hypoc hlorhydria (reduced acid production, eg in chronic atrophic gastritis) should be excluded as this also causes a raised gastrin level: gastric pH should be <2. The secretin stimulation test is useful in suspected cases with only mildly raised gastrin levels (100–1000pg/mL). The adenoma is often small and diffi cult to image; a combination of somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, endoscopic ultrasound, and CT is used to localize and stage the adenoma. OGD evalu- ates gastric/duodenal ulceration. : High-dose proton pump inhibitors, eg omepra- zole: start with 60mg/d and adjust according to response. Measuring intragastric pH helps determine the best dose (aim to keep pH at 2–7). All gastrinomas have malig- nant potential—and surgery is better sooner than later (with lymph node clearance generally recommended if >2cm in size). Surgery may be avoided in MEN1, as adeno- mas are often multiple, and metastatic disease is rare. If well-diff erentiated (G1 and G2) somatostatin
