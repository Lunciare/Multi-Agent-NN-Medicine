autosomal recessive disorder of a copper transporting ATPase, ATP7B. Physiology Total body copper content is ~125mg. Intake ≈ 3mg/day (absorbed in proximal small intestine). In the liver, copper is incorporated into caeruloplasmin. In Wilson’s disease, copper incorporation into caeruloplasmin in hepatocytes and ex- cretion into bile are impaired. Copper accumulates in liver, and later in other organs. Signs Children present with liver disease (hepatitis, cirrhosis, fulmin ant liver fail- ure); young adults often start with CNS signs: tremor; dysarthria, dys pha gia; dyski- nesias; dystonias; dementia; Parkinsonism; ataxia/clumsiness. Mood: Depress ion/mania; labile emotions; libido; personality change. Ignoring these may cause years of needless misery: often the doctor who is good at combin- ing the analytical and integrative aspects will be the fi rst to make the diagnosis. Cognition: Memory; slow to solve problems; IQ; delusions; mutism. Kayser–Fleis cher (KF) rings: Copper in iris (see 6 in following list); they are not invariable. Also: Haemolysis; blue lunulae (nails); arthritis; hypermobile joints; grey skin. Tests Equivocal copper studies need expert interpretation. 1 Urine: 24h copper excretion is high, eg >100mcg/24h (normal <40mcg). 2 LFT: non-specifi c (but ALT >1500 is not part of the picture). 3 Serum copper: typically <11μmol/L. 4 Serum
