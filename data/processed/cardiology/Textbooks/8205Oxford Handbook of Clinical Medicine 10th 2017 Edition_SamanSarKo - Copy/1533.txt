veins. Fig 13.10 Right arm PICC (peripherally inserted cen- tral catheter) still with a wire in the lumen. This is a radiograph at the time of insertion to determine if placement is correct. The tip lies in the SVC—ie good positioning for TPN or long-term antibiotic therapy. The tip of a Hickman line, for cytotoxic administra- tion, is better in the right atrium, to avoid possible irritation of the SVC and consequent thrombosis or stenosis. NB: this image was acquired in the angiog- raphy room, where radio-opaque material appears black (it is easier to see contrast media against a white background). A similar eff ect may be achieved by digitally inverting a standard X-ray.

This group face a greater risk of post- operative infection and cardiac complications. Tight glycaemic control is therefore essential and improves outcome. Aim to achieve an HbA1C of <69mmol/mol prior to elective surgery. Patients are often well informed about their diabetes—involve them fully in managing their diabetic care. Check your hospital’s policy for managing dia- betic patients who will be NBM before
