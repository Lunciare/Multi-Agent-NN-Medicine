referral of abdominal pain Gut Division points Somatic referral Arterial supply Fore Proximal to 2nd part of duodenum Epigastrium Coeliac axis Mid Above to ⅔ along transverse colon Periumbilical Superior mesenteric Hind Distal to above Suprapubic Inferior mesenteric Early infl ammation irritates the structure and walls of the appendix, so a colicky pain is referred to the mid-abdomen—classically periumbilical. As the infl ammation progresses and irritates the parietal peritoneum (especially on examination), the somatic, lateralized pain settles at McBurney’s point, ⅔ of the way along from the umbilicus to the right anterior superior iliac spine. These principles also help us understand patterns of referred pain. In pneumo- nia, the T9 dermatome is shared by the lung and the abdomen. Also, irritation of the underside of the diaphragm (sensory innervation is from above through the phrenic nerve, C3–5) by an infl amed gallbladder or a subphrenic abscess refers pain to the right shoulder: dermatomes C3–5.  • Ectopic (do a pregnancy • Cholecystitis • Crohn’s disease test!) • Diverticulitis • Perforated ulcer • UTI (test urine!) • Salpingitis/PID • Food poisoning • Mesenteric adenitis • Dysmenorrhoea • Meckel’s diverticulum • Cystitis.
