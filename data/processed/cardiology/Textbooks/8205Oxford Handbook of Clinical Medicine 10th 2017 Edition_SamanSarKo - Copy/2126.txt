signs, autonomic dysfunction (labile BP, HR, sweating, urinary incontinence), mutism, confusion, coma, WCC, CK; it may be treated with cooling. Dantrolene 1–2.5mg/kg IV (p572) (max 10mg/kg/day) can help, bromocriptine and amantadine are alternatives. Carbon tetrachloride poisoning This solvent, used in many industrial processes, causes vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, seizures, coma, renal failure, and tender hepatomegaly with jaundice and liver failure. IV acetylcysteine may improve prog- nosis. Seek expert help. Organophosphate insecticides Inactivate cholinesterase—the resulting increase in acetylcholine causes the SLUD response: salivation, lacrimation, urination, and di- arrhoea. Also look for sweating, small pupils, muscle fasciculation, coma, respiratory distress, and bradycardia. Treatment: Wear gloves; remove soiled clothes. Wash skin. Take blood (FBC and serum cholinesterase activity). Give atropine IV 2mg every 10min till full atropinization (skin dry, pulse >70, pupils dilated). Up to 3d treatment may be needed. Also give pralidoxime 30mg/kg IVI over 20min, then 8mg/kg/h, max 12g in 24h. Even if fi ts are not occurring, diazepam 5–10mg IV slowly seems to help. Paraquat poisoning (Found in weed-killers.) This causes D&V, painful oral ulcers, alveolitis, and renal failure. Diagnose by urine test. Give activated charcoal at once (100g followed by a laxative, then 50g/3–4h). Get expert help. Avoid O2
