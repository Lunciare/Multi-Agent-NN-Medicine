and be transferred to a primary PCI centre after the infusion for either rescue PCI (if residual ST elevation) or angiography (if successful). Use beyond 12h if evidence of ongoing ischaemia or in stable patients presenting after 12–24h may be appropriate—seek specialist advice. • Thrombolysis: Benefi t reduces steadily from onset of pain, target time is <30min from admission; use >12h from symptom onset requires specialist advice. Do not thrombolyse ST depression alone, T-wave inversion alone, or normal ECG. Thrombolysis is best achieved with tissue plasminogen activators (eg tenect- eplase as a single IV bolus). CI: •Previous intracranial haemorrhage. •Ischaemic stroke <6months. •Cerebral malignancy or AVM. •Recent major trauma/surgery/ head injury (<3wks). •GI bleeding (<1 month). •Known bleeding disorder. •Aortic dissection. •Non-compressible punctures <24h, eg liver biopsy, lumbar puncture. Relative CI: •TIA <6 months. •Anticoagulant therapy. •Pregnancy/<1wk post par- tum. •Refractory hypertension (>180mmHg/110mmHg). •Advanced liver disease. •Infective endocarditis. •Active peptic ulcer. •Prolonged/traumatic resuscitation. Patients with STEMI who do not receive reperfusion (eg presenting >12h after symptom onset) should be treated with fondaparinux, or enoxaparin/unfraction- ated heparin if not available. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 779966 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE  Management of an acute STEMI 797 Attach ECG monitor and record a 12-lead ECG IV
