leukaph eresis, as viscosity rises (risk of leukostasis). • DIC: The release of procoagulants into the circulation causes widespread activa- tion of coagulation, consuming clotting factors and platelets and causing risk of bleeding. Fibrin strands fi ll small vessels, haemolysing passing RBCs. Fibrinolysis is also activated. Causes: Malignancy, sepsis, trauma, obstetric events. Signs: (fi g 8.44) Bruising, bleeding anywhere (eg venep uncture sites), renal failure. Tests: Platelets; PT; APTT; fi brinogen (correlates with severity); fi brin degra- dation products (D-dimers). Film: broken RBCS (schisto cytes). : Treat the cause. Replace platelets if <50≈109/L, cryoprecipitate to replace fi brinogen, FFP to re- place coagulation factors. Heparin is controversial. The use of all-transretinoic acid (ATRA) has signifi cantly reduced the risk of DIC in acute pro myelocytic leu- kaemia (the commonest leukaemia associated with DIC). • Preventing sepsis: Give fl uoroquinolone (eg ciprofl oxacin) before neutropenia gets serious. Granulocyte colony stimulators (G-CSF) can increase the production of WBCs (granulocytes) from bone marrow, but should not be given routinely in chemo- therapy. Herpes, pneumocystis, and CMV prophylaxis has a role. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 335522 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygolotameaH MASCC score 353 The Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) assess- ment tool can be used
