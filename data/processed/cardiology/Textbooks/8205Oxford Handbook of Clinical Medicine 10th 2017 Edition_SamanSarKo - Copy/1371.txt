months. Calcium is highly protein-bound and needs correcting to the serum albumin concentration. PTH levels should be suppressed (see pp676–7). Causes: PTH-related protein produced by the tumour (see p529), local osteolysis, eg myeloma, tumour production of calcitriol. Signs and symptoms: Weight loss, anorexia, nausea, polydipsia, polyuria, constipa- tion, abdominal pain, dehydration, weakness, confusion, seizure, coma. Management: Aggressive rehydration. Bisphosphonates (if eGFR ≥30), eg zoledronic acid IV, usually normalize calcium within 3 days and can be given as a repeated infu- sion. Calcitonin produces a more rapid (2h) but short-term eff ect and tolerance can develop. Long-term treatment is by cont rol of t he underlying malignancy. 1 Pemberton described this ‘useful’ sign of venous obstruction due to a goitre in 1946. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 552288 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 erac evitaillap dna ygolocnO Brain metastases 529 Aff ect up to ~40% of patients with cancer. Most commonly: lung, breast, colorectal, melanoma. Poor prognosis: median survival 1–2 months; better prognosis with single lesion, breast cancer (see also p830). Signs and symptoms: Headache (~50%, often worse in the morning, when cough- ing or bending), focal neurological signs (~30%), ataxia (~21%), fi ts (~18%), nausea, vomiting, papilloedema. Management: Urgent CT/MRI depending on underlying diagnosis, disease stage, and
