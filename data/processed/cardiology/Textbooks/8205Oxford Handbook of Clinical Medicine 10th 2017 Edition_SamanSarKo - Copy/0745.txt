rese c tion. 5yr survival ~30%. Post-op complications include liver failure, bile leak, and GI bleeding. Stenting of obstructed extrahepatic biliary tree, percutaneously or via ERCP (p742), improves quality of life. Liver transplantation rarely possible. Prognosis: ~5 months. Benign tumours Haemangiomas: The commonest benign liver tumours. They are often an incidental fi nding on ultrasound or CT and don’t require treatment. Avoid biopsy! Adenomas: Common. Causes: anabolic steroids, oral contraceptive pill; pregnancy. Only treat if symptomatic, or >5cm. 34 Haemobilia is late in HCC. Think of bleeding into the biliary tree whenever Quincke’s triad obtains: RUQ pain, upper GI haemorrhage, and jaundice. It may be life-threatening. 35 5yr cumulative risk if cirrhosis is present is 30% in Japan and 17% in USA. 36 Operative mortality: 1.6%. Recurrence is more likely if histology showed neoplastic emboli in small vessels. Get early warning of recurrence by arranging imaging, eg if AFP >5.45mcg/L (esp. if trend is ris- ing). Fibrolamellar HCC, which occurs in children and young adults, has a better prognosis. 37 Milan criteria for liver transplantation in HCC: 1 nodule <5cm or 2–3 nodules <3cm. 38 TACE=transarterial chemoembolization, eg with drug-eluting beads; it causes fever and abdo pain in 50%. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb
