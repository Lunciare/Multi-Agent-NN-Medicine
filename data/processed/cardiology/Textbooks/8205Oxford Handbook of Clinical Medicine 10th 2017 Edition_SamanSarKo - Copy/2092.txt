EEG monitoring in ICU. NB: never spend longer than 20min on someone with status epilepticus without having help at the bedside from an anaesthetist Fig 19.20 Management of status epilepticus. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 882277 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 828 Head injury If the pupils are unequal, diagnose rising intracranial pressure (ICP), eg from ex- tradural haemorrhage, and summon urgent neurosurgical help (p482). Retinal vein pulsation at fundoscopy helps exclude ICP. Initial management See fi g 19.21. Write full notes. Record times. Stabilization of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) remains the 1st priority. If GCS ≤8 then seek urgent anaesthetic and ICU help to protect airway.15 • Involve neurosurgeons early, especially if GCS, or if ICP suspected. • Examine the CNS. Chart pulse, BP, T°, respirations + pupils every 15min. • Assess anterograde amnesia (loss from the time of injury, ie post-traumatic) and retrograde amnesia (for events prior to injury)—extent of retrograde loss corre- lates with severity of injury, and never occurs without anterograde amnesia. • Nurse semi-prone if no spinal injury; meticulous care to airway and bladder. Perform a CT head <1h if: • GCS <13 on initial assessment, or GCS <15 at 2h following injury. • Focal neurological defi cit. • Suspected
