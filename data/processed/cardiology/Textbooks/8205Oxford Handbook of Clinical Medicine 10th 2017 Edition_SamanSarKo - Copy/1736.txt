calculated by measuring the excreted creatinine in a 24h urine collection and comparing it with the serum creatinine concentra- tion. However, the accuracy of collection is vital but often poor, making this an unreliable and inconvenient method. GFR can also be measured by injection of a radioisotope followed by sequential blood sampling (51Cr-EDTA) or by an isotope scan (eg DTPA 99Tc, p190). These meth- ods allow a more accurate estimate of GFR than creatinine clearance, since smaller proportions of these substances are reabsorbed in the tubules. They also have the advantage of being able to provide split renal function. Inulin clearance: The gold standard for calculating GFR, because 100% of fi ltered inulin (not insulin) is retained in the luminal fl uid and therefore refl ects exactly the rate of fi ltration of water and solutes in the glomerulus. However, measuring inulin clearance again requires urine collection over several hours, and also a constant IV infusion of inulin, and is therefore inconvenient to perform. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 666699 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC 670 Acid–base balance Arterial blood pH is closely regulated in health to 7.40 ± 0.05 by various mechanisms including bicarbonate, other plasma buff ers such as deoxygenated haemoglobin, and the
