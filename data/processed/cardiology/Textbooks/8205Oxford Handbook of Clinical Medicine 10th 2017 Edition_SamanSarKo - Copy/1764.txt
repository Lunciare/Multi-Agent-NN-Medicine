Bone mineral density (g/cm2) is compared with that of a young healthy adult. The ‘T-score’ is the number of standard deviations (SD, p751) the bone mineral density (BMD) is from the youthful average. Each decrease of 1 SD in BMD ≈ 2.6-fold  in risk of hip fracture. Table 14.5 Interpreting DEXA bone scan results T-score >0 BMD is better than the reference. 0 to Ω1 BMD is in the top 84%: no
