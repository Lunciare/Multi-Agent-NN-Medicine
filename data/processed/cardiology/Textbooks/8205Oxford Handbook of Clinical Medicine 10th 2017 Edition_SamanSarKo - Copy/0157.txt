Breathing patterns Hyperventilation: Tachypnoea (ie >20 breaths/min) or deep (hyperp noea, ie tidal volume). Hyperpnoea is not unpleasant, unlike dyspnoea. It may cause respiratory alkalosis, hence paraesthesiae ± muscle spasm (Ca2+). The main cause is anxiety: associated dizziness, chest tightness/pain, palpita tions, and panic. Rare causes: response to metabolic acidosis; brainstem lesions. • Kussmaul respiration is deep,
