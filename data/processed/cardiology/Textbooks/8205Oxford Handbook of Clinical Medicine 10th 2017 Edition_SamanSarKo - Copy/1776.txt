Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT, GT) • Liver disease (particularly alcohol-induced damage, cholestasis, drugs). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) • Myocardial infarction (p118). • Liver disease (suggests hepatocyte damage). • Haemolysis (esp. sickle cell crisis), pulmonary embolism, and tumour necrosis. Troponin • Subtypes troponin T and troponin I are used clinically. • Cardiac damage or strain (MI—p118, pericarditis, myocarditis, PE, sepsis, CPR). • Chronic kidney disease (troponin T only; elevation less marked; aetiology unknown). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 668888 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 yrtsimehc lacinilC Enzyme inducers and inhibitors 689 Hepatic drug metabolism is mainly by conjugation or oxidation. The oxidative pathways are catalysed by the family of cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, the most important of which is the CYP 3A4 isoenzyme. The cytochrome P450 pathway may be either induced or inhibited by a range of commonly used drugs and foods (table 14.7). This can lead to important interactions or side-eff ects. For example, phenytoin reduces the eff ectiveness of the contraceptive pill due to more rapid oestrogen metabolism, and ciprofl oxacin retards the metabolism of methylxanthines (ami- nophylline) which leads to higher plasma levels and potentially more side-eff ects. The BNF contains a list of the major interactions between drugs. Table 14.7 Common inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450
