bacteria in urine may provide additional information. There is no ‘gold-standard’ bacterial count. Lower UTI: Bladder (cystitis), prostate (prostatitis). Upper UTI: Pyelonephritis = infection of kidney/renal pelvis. Abacterial cystitis/ure- thral syndrome: A diagnosis of exclusion in patients with dysuria and frequency, without demonstrable infection. Urethritis: See pp412–3. Incidence Annual incidence of UTI in women is 10–20%. 10% of men and 20% of women >65 years have asymptomatic bacteriuria (>65 years MSU is no longer diagnos- tic and clinical assessment is mandatory). Pyelonephritis = 3 per 1000 patient years. Classifi cation • Uncomplicated: normal renal tract structure and function. • Complicated: structural/functional abnormality of genitourinary tract, eg obstruc- tion, catheter, stones, neurogenic bladder, renal transplant. Risk factors • Bacterial inoculation: Sexual activity, urinary incontinence, faecal incontinence, constipation. • Binding of uropathogenic bacteria: Spermicide use, oestrogen, menopause. • Urine fl ow: Dehydration, obstructed urinary tract (p640). • Bacterial growth: DM, immunosuppression, obstruction, stones, catheter, renal tract malformation, pregnancy. Symptoms • Cystitis: Frequency, dysuria, urgency, suprap ubic pain, polyuria, haematuria. • Acute pyelonephritis: Fever, rigor, vomiting, loin pain/tenderness, costovertebral pain, associated cystitis symptoms, septic shock. • Prostatitis: Pain: perineum, rectum, scrotum, penis, bladder, lower back.
