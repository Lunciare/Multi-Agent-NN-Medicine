creatinine, including the eff ects of muscle mass and dilution, no other biomarker has been able to supersede it (yet). The clinical approach to AKI is shown in fi g 7.3.3 Epidemiology AKI is common, occurring in up to 18% of hospital patients and ~50% of ICU patients. Risk factors for AKI include pre-existing CKD, age, male sex, and comorbidity (DM, cardiovascular disease, malignancy, chronic liver disease, complex surgery). Causes Commonest causes: 1 Sepsis. 2 Major surgery. 3 Cardiogenic shock. 4 Other hypovolaemia. 5 Drugs. 6 Hepatorenal syndrome. 7 Obstruction. Aetiology can be divided according to site (table 7.4) as: • pre-renal: perfusion to the kidney. • renal: intrinsic renal disease. • post-renal: obstruction to urine.
