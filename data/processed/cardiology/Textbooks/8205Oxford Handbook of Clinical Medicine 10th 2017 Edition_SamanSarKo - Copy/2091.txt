seizures are controlled, start oral drugs (p492). Ask what the cause was, eg hypoglycaemia, pregnancy, alcohol, drugs, CNS lesion or infection, hypertensive encephalopathy, inadequate anticonvulsant dose/compliance (p490). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 882266 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE  Management of convulsive status epilepticus 827 Open and secure the airway (adjuncts as necessary) Remove false teeth if poorly fi tting Oxygen, 100% + suction (as required) IV access and take blood: U&E, LFT, FBC, glucose, Ca2+ Toxicology screen if indicated Anticonvulsant levels IV bolus—to stop seizures: eg lorazepam 4mg Give 2nd dose of lorazepam if no response after 10–20min Thiamine 250mg IV over 30min if alcoholism or malnourishment suspected Glucose 50mL 50% IV, unless glucose known to be normal Treat acidosis if severe (contact ICU) Correct hypotension with fl uids IV infusion: If seizures continue, start phenytoin, 15–18mg/kg IVI, at a rate of 50mg/min. Monitor ECG and BP. 100mg/6–8h is a maintenance dose (check levels) General anaesthesia: Continuing seizures after 60–90mins of above therapies require expert help with paralysis (eg propofol infusion) and ventilation with continuous EEG monitoring in ICU. NB: never spend longer than 20min on someone with status epilepticus without having help at the bedside from an anaesthetist Fig 19.20 Management of status epilepticus.
