mannitol) can be useful but may lead to rebound ICP after prolonged use (~12–24h): Give 20% solution 0.25–0.5g/kg IV over 10–20min (eg 5mL/kg). Eff ect is seen after ~20min and lasts for 2–6h. Follow serum osmolality—aim for about 300mosmol/kg but don’t exceed 310 Corticosteroids are not effective in reducing ICP except for oedema surrounding tumours: Eg dexamethasone 10mg IV and follow with 4mg/6h IV/PO Consider other measures, eg sedation, anti-epileptics, therapeutic hypothermia Restrict fl uid to <1 . 5L/d Monitor the patient closely; consider monitoring ICP Aim to make a diagnosis Treat cause or exacerbating factors, eg hyperglycaemia, hyponatraemia Defi nitive treatment if possible Fig 19.22 Immediate management plan for raised intracranial pressure. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 883311 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 832 Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) Mechanism Normally the body metabolizes carbohydrates, leading to effi cient en- ergy production. Ketoacidosis is an alternative metabolic pathway used in starva- tion states; it is far less effi cient, and produces acetone as a byproduct (hence the fruity breath of patients in ketosis). In acute diabetic ketoacidosis, there is excessive glucose, but because of a lack of insulin, this cannot be taken up into cells to be metabolized, so pushing the body into a starvation-like state where
