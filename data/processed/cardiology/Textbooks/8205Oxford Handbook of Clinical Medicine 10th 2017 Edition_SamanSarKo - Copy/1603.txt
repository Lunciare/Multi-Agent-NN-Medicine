Endoscopic stenting should be considered for palliation in malignant obstruction and as a bridge to surgery in acute obstruction. Stenting  need for colostomy, has less complica- tions than emergency surgery, shortens intensive care and total hospital stays, and prevents unnecessary opera tions. Surgery with liver resection may be curative if single-lobe hepatic metastases and no extrahepatic spread. Radiotherapy is mostly used in palliation for colonic cancer. It is occasionally used pre-op in rectal cancer to allow resection. Post-op radiotherapy is only used in pa- tients with rectal tumours at high risk of local recurrence. Chemotherapy Adjuvant chemotherapy for stage 3 disease has been shown to re- duce disease recurrence by 30% and mortality by 25%. Benefi ts for stage 2 disease are more marginal and warrant an individualized approach. The FOLFOX regimen has become standard (fl uorouracil,
