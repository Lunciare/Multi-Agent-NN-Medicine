and AF’). Consider ablation if symptomatic or frequent episodes. Atrial fl utter See pp130–1, fi g 3.35. Treatment: Similar to AF regarding rate and rhythm control and the need for anticoagulation.29 DC cardioversion is preferred to pharmacological cardioversion; start with 70–120J. IV amiodarone may be needed if rate control is proving diffi cult. Recurrence rates are high so radiofrequency ablation is often recommended for long-term management. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 113300 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC Anticoagulation and AF 131 Acute AF: Use heparin until a full risk assessment for emboli (see below) is made— eg AF started <48h ago and elective cardioversion is being planned. If >48h, ensure ≥3wks of therapeutic anticoagulation before elective cardiov ersion; NB trans-oe- sophageal-guided cardioversion is an option if urgent cardioversion is required. Use a DOAC (eg apixaban) or warfarin (target INR 2–3) if high risk of emboli (past ischaemic stroke, TIA, or emboli; 75yrs with BP, DM; coronary or peripheral arte- rial disease; evidence of valve disease or LV function/CCF—only do echo if unsure). 30 Use no anticoagulation if stable sinus rhythm has been restored, no risk factors for emboli, and AF recurrence unlikely (ie no failed cardioversions, no structural heart disease, no previous recurrences, no sustained
