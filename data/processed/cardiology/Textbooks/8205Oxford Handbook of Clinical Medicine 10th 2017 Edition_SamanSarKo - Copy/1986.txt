(see p775), though NICE recommends that all routine internal jugular catheters should be placed with US guidance. Even if the line is not placed under direct US visualization, a look to check vessel size, position in relation to artery, and patency (no thrombus or stenosis) is extremely useful. For contraindications, see table 18.2. Table 18.2 Contraindications to central venous cannulation Absolute Relative Infection at insertion site Coagulopathy Ipsilateral carotid endarterectomy Newly inserted cardiac pacemaker leads Thrombus within the vein Venous stenosis Ipsilateral abnormal anatomy Sites of insertion These include the internal jugular vein (see p775 and p43), sub- clavian vein, and the femoral vein. The choice depends largely on operator experi- ence, but evidence suggests that the femoral approach is associated with a higher rate of line infection and thrombosis. Overall, the internal jugular approach (with ultrasound guidance) is most commonly used and risks fewer complications than the subclavian. If possible, get written consent (p568). Check clotting and platelets. The technique for internal jugular (routine) and femoral (emergency) are given here. Complications (~20%.) Insertion is not without hazard, so decide whether the pa- tient requires a line fi rst, and then ask for help if you are inexperienced. Bleeding; arterial
