All hospi- tal inpatients should be assessed for DVT/PE risk and off ered prophylaxis if appropri- ate. 65% of below-knee DVTs are asymptomatic; these rarely embolize to the lung. Risk factors Age, pregnancy, synthetic oestrogen, trauma, surgery (especially pel- vic/orthopaedic), past DVT, cancer, obesity, immobility, thrombophilia (p374). Signs •Calf warmth/tenderness/swelling/erythema. •Mild fever. •Pitting oedema.  Cellulitis; ruptured Baker’s cyst. Both may coexist with a DVT. Tests Calculate Wells score (see table 13.5) before ordering D-dimer. D-dimer is sen- sitive but not specifi c for DVT (also  in infection, pregnancy, malignancy, and post-op). Wells score: ≤1 point = DVT unlikely: Perform D-dimer. If negative, DVT excluded. If positive, proceed to USS (if USS negative, DVT excluded; if positive, treat as DVT). ≥2 points = DVT likely: Do D-dimer and USS. If both negative, DVT excluded. If USS posi- tive, treat as DVT. If D-dimer positive and USS negative, repeat USS in 1 week. Do thrombophilia tests (p374) before commencing anticoagulant therapy if there are no predisposing factors, in recurrent DVT, or if DVT in unusual site. Look for un- derlying
