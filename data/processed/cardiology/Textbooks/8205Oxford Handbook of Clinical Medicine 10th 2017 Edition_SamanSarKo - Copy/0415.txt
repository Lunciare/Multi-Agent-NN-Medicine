2:1000 births); acquired (post-MI). Symptoms: May present with severe heart failure in infancy, or remain asymptomatic and be detected incidentally in later life. Signs: Classically, a harsh pan systolic murmur is heard at the left sternal edge, with a systolic thrill, ± left para sternal heave. Smaller holes, which are haemo- dynamically less signifi cant, give louder murmurs. Signs of pulmonary hypertension. Complications: AR, IE/SBE, pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger’s complex (above), heart failure from volume overload. Tests: ECG: normal, LAD, LVH, RVH. CXR: normal heart size ± mild pulmonary plethora (small VSD) or cardiomegaly, large pulmonary arteries and marked pulmonary plethora (large VSD). Cardiac catheter: step up in O2 saturation in right ventricle. Treatment: Initially medical as many close sponta- neously. Indications for surgical closure: failed medical therapy, symptomatic VSD, shunt >3 : 1, SBE/IE. Endovascular closure may be possible. 71 Coarctation of the aorta Congenital narrowing of the descending aorta; usually occurs just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. More common in boys. Associations: Bicuspid aortic valve; Turner’s syndrome. Signs: Radiofemoral delay; weak femoral pulse; BP; scapular bruit; systolic murmur (best heard over the left scapula); cold feet. Complications: Heart failure from high afterload; IE; intracer- ebral
