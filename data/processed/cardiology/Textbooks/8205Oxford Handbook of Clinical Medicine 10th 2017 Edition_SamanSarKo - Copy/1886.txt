original alignment by an angle depending on the amount of energy they absorb. • When the RF pulse stops, the nuclei fl ip back (or relax) into their original alignment, emitting the energy (called an echo) that was absorbed from the RF pulse. • Measuring and plotting the energy of the returning signal according to location (provided the nuclei haven’t moved) gives a picture of fat, tissue, and water as distributed throughout the body. • The hydrogen nuclei in fl owing blood move after receiving the RF pulses. The echo is not detected, and so the vessel lumen appears black (fl ow void). Rather than radiodensity or attenuation, the correct descriptive terminology for the greyscale seen in MRI is signal intensity: high signal appears white and low signal black (see table 16.4). Weighting is a quality of MRI that is dependent on the time between the RF pulses (repetition time, TR) and the time between an RF pulse and the echo (echo time, TE). MR images are most commonly T1-weighted (good for visualizing anatomy) or T2-weighted (good for visualizing disease) but can also be a mixture of both, called proton density (PD) weighting. FLAIR sequences produce heavily T2-weighted images. A
