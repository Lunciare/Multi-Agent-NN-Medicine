Palpate: Note any masses, tenderness, guarding (involuntary tensing of abdominal muscles—pain or fear of it), or rebound tenderness (greater pain on removing hand than on gently depressing abdomen—peritoneal infl ammation); Rovsing’s sign (ap- pendicitis, p608); Murphy’s sign (cholecystitis, p634). Palpating the liver: Assess size (see BOX ‘Causes of hepatomegaly’), regularity, smoothness, and tenderness. Pulsa- tile (tricuspid regurgitation)? The scratch test is another way to fi nd the lower liver edge (if it is below the costal margin): start with diaphragm of stethoscope at right costal margin. Gently scratch the abdominal wall, starting in the right lower quad- rant, working towards the liver edge. A sharp increase in transm ission of the scratch is heard when the border of the liver is reached. Palpating the spleen: If suspect splenomegaly but cannot detect it, assess patient in the right lateral position with your left hand pulling forwards from behind the rib cage. Palpating the kidneys: See fi g 2.30, p61. May be non palpable unless slim. Enlarged? Nodular? Palpating the aorta: Normally palpable transmitted pulsation in thin individuals. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 6622 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 noitanimaxe dna yrotsiH Percussion 63 Confi rm the lower border and defi ne the upper border of the liver and
