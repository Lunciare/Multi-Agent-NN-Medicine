Causes Oral, pharyngeal, or oesophageal? Mechanical or motility related? (See BOX ‘Causes of dysphagia’.) Five key questions to ask 1 Was there diffi culty swallowing solids and liquids from the start? Yes: motility disorder (eg achalasia, CNS, or pharyngeal causes). No: Solids then liquids: suspect a stricture (benign or malignant). 2 Is it diffi cult to initiate a swallowing movement? Yes: Suspect bulbar palsy, especially if patient coughs on swallowing. 3 Is swallowing painful (odynophagia)? Yes: Suspect ulceration (malignancy, oesophagitis, viral infection or Candida in immunocompromised, or poor steroid inhaler technique) or spasm. 4 Is the dysphagia intermittent or is it constant and getting worse? Intermittent: suspect oesophageal spasm. Constant and worsening: suspect malignant stricture. 5 Does the neck bulge or gurgle on drinking? Yes: Suspect a pharyngeal pouch (see OHCS p570).
