These are variously attributed to interstitial oedema and engorged peripheral lym- phatics. Cardiomegaly—cardiothoracic ratio >50% on a PA fi lm. Dilated prominent upper lobe veins (upper lobe diversion). Pleural Eff usions. Other features include peribronchial cuffi ng (thickened bronchial walls) and fl uid in the fi ssures. (b) ‘Bat’s wing’, peri-hilar pulmonary oedema indicating heart failure and fl uid overload. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 113355 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 136 Heart failure—management Acute heart failure This is a medical emergency (p800). Chronic heart failure Stop smoking. Stop drinking alcohol. Eat less salt. Optimize weight & nutrition.33 • Treat the cause (eg if dysrhythmias; valve disease). • Treat exacerbating factors (anaemia, thyroid disease, infection, BP). • Avoid exacerbating factors, eg NSAIDS (fl uid retention) and verapamil (Ωve inotrope). • Annual ’fl u vaccine, one-off pneumococcal vaccine. • Drugs: 1 Diuretics: Give loop diuretics to relieve symptoms, eg furosemide 40mg/24h PO or bumetanide 1–2mg/24h PO. Increase dose as necessary. SE: K+, renal im- pairment. Monitor U&E and add K+-sparing diuretic (eg spironolactone) if K+ <3.2mmol/L, predisposition to arrhythmias, concurrent digoxin therapy, or pre- existing K+-losing conditions. If refractory oedema, consider adding a thiazide, eg metolazone 5–20mg/24h PO. Diuretics improve symptoms but studies show- ing mortality
