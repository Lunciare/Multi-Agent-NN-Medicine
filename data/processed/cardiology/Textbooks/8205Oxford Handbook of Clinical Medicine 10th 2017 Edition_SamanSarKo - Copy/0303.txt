Arrhythmias may be induced, and the eff ectiveness of control by drugs assessed. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 111122 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC (a) 113 (b) (c) Fig 3.18 (a) Coronary artery anatomy. (b) and (c) Images from angiography. (b) shows stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). In (c), the same patient has had their LAD stented, al- lowing contrast to fl ow freely through to the distal vessel. The stenting is a type of angioplasty (a procedure to widen the lumen of a blood vessel); in the context of coronary arteries, it is called PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention). PPCI (primary PCI) is PCI performed acutely for a patient with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), see p120.

Used in low dose (eg 75mg/24h PO) for secondary prevention following MI, TIA/stroke, and for patients with angina or peripheral vascular disease. May have a role in primary prevention.7 ADP receptor antagonists (eg clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor) also block platelet aggregation,
