to resection. As a result, pre-operative imaging may need to be more extensive. A new skill has to be learned and taught. Day-case surgery Advances in surgical techniques as well as perioperative care mean better results for the patient (shorter waiting lists, fewer infections, fewer days off work, and patient satisfaction). Many operations can now be performed as day cases. Theoretically any procedure is suitable, provided the time under general anaesthetic does not exceed ~1h. The use of regional anaesthesia helps to avoid the SE of nausea and disorientation that may accompany a general anaesthetic, thus facilitating discharge. Bear in mind that the following groups of patients may not be suitable for day-case surgery: •Severe dementia. •Severe learning diffi culties. •Living alone (and no helpers). •Children if supervision diffi cult—changes in expectation, delays, and pain relief can be problematic. •BMI >32 (p244). •ASA category ≥ III (p567) thus potentially unstable comorbidities—discuss with the anaesthetist. •Infection at the site of the operation. Exposing patients to our learning curves? The jury is still out… All surgeons get better over time (for a while), as they perform new techniques with increasing ease and confi dence.
