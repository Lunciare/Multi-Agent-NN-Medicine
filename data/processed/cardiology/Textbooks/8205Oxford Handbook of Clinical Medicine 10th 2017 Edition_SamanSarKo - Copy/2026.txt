sodium (eg 0.9% saline) over 15mins. Caution in heart failure. • If no improvement after two boluses, speak with a senior. Oxygen: Give oxygen as required for target saturations. These will be 94–98% (or 88–92% if the patient is at risk of CO2 retention, eg in severe COPD). Critical care review: Speak with critical care early if intensive care support (eg inotropes, ventilation, haemofi ltration, intensive monitoring) may be required. Surgical involvement: Eg emergency wound debridement. Manage acute complications: Shock (p790), AKI (p298), DIC (p352), ARDS (p186), ar- rhythmias (may spontaneously resolve when sepsis improves). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 779922 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0099 seicnegremE 793  Acute management of sepsis in adults Recognize the need to assess for sepsis • Consider possibility of sepsis in any patient with signs or symptoms that are suggestive of infection (eg productive cough or off ensive oozing wound) • Consider non-specifi c signs (patient/carer concern; altered mental state; feeling generally unwell), particularly when there is reason to have low threshold for sepsis assessment (see BOX) Gather information History: Full medical history: take time to clarify the time course of symp- toms and any travel history Examination: • General: capillary refi ll time, mottled/ashen skin, conscious level • Localize
