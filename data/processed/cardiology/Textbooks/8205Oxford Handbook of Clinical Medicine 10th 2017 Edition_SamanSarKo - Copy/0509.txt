Infl ammatory cell infi ltrate and pulmonary fi brosis of unknown cause. It is the commonest cause of interstitial lung disease. Symptoms Dry cough; exertional dyspnoea; malaise; weight; arthralgia. Signs Cyanosis; fi nger clubbing; fi ne end-inspiratory crepitations. Complications Respiratory failure; risk of lung cancer. Tests Blood: ABG (PaO2; if severe, PaCO2); CRP; immunoglobulins; ANA (30% +ve), rheumatoid factor (10% +ve). Imaging: (fi g 4.20) Lung volume; bilateral lower zone reticulo-nodular shadows; honeycomb lung (advanced disease). CT: Shows similar changes to the CXR but is more sensitive and is an essential for diagnosis. Spirom- etry: Restrictive (p162); transfer factor. BAL: May indicate activity of alveolitis: lymphocytes (good response/prognosis) or neutrophils and eosinophils (poor response/prognosis). 99TCm-DTPA scan: (diethylene-triamine-penta-acetic acid) May refl ect disease activity.59 Lung biopsy: May be needed for diagnosis. The histological changes observed on biopsy are referred to as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). Management Supportive care: oxygen, pulmonary rehabilitation, opiates, palliative care input. All
