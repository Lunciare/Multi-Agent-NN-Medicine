tis, AKI, pulmonary haemorrhage, ARDS, myo/pericarditis. (Weil’s disease described in 1886: fever, jaundice splenomegaly, renal failure, CNS symptoms. Term now applied to all severe disease.) Diagnosis: In UK18 via National Leptospirosis Service ( gov.uk/guidance/leptospira-reference-unit-services). Culture (blood/CSF) +ve during 1st phase. Serology. PCR. Treatment: Doxycycline, penicillin. Confl icting evidence of benefi t for steroids in severe disease. Yersinia pestis (plague) Gram Ωve, obligate intracellular pathogen transmitted by small animals and their fl eas by bite, direct contact, inhalation or ingestion (rare). ~300 cases/yr worldwide. Presen- tation: Incubation: 3–7d. Flu-like symptoms, then one of three disease forms: 1 Bubonic: most common form. Yersinia pestis enters at bite and travels via lym- phatics. Infl amed, painful lymph node is termed ’bubo’ and can suppurate. 2 Septic aemic: direct spread without ‘bubo’, or advanced stage after ‘bubo’. 3 Pneumonic: lung disease. Most virulent, least common. Usually from advanced bu- bonic form but can then transmit via droplets to other humans without fl eas/animals. Diagnosis: Culture bubo fl uid, blood, sputum. Rapid antigen testing available. Treatment: Reduces mortality from 60% to <15%: streptomycin, tetracycline.12 Toxoplasmosis Fig 9.34 Oocysts in cat faeces can stay in the soil for months, where rats eat them. The rats get
