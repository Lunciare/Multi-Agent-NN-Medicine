spiral. • Aerobes/anaerobes: some bacteria cannot sur- vive without oxygen (obligate aerobes), whilst others cannot grow in its presence (obligate an- aerobes). Many more can survive in either en- vironment (facultative anaerobes). Some types of infection are more likely to involve aerobic or anaerobic bacteria, eg GI infections are typi-Fig 9.3 (a) Gram-positive versus cally anaerobic. (b) Gram-negative cell membranes.

Bacteriostatic: Stops replication without killing existing bacteria. Capsulate bacteria: Bacteria with a thick outer capsule, eg Haemophilus infl uen- zae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. These are destroyed in the spleen. Following splenectomy (or splenic infarction, eg sickle cell anaemia) there is an increased risk of infection by capsulate bacteria and prophylactic vac- cination should be off ered (p407). Commensal: An organism that lives in/on a host without causing harm. Endotoxin: A lipopolysaccharide complex found on the outer membrane of Gram- negative bacteria. Can elicit an infl ammatory response. Activates complement via the alternative pathway. Enterotoxin: Exotoxin that targets the gut, eg Clostridium diffi cile
