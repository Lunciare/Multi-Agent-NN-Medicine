aim for <140/85mmHg, p140); hyperlipidaemia (p690); DM (p206); help to stop smoking (p93). • Antiplatelet drugs: As with stroke, give aspirin 300mg OD for 2wks, then switch to clopidogrel 75mg OD. If this is contraindicated or not tolerated, give aspirin 75mg OD combined with slow-release dipyridamole. • Anticoagulation indications: Cardiac source of emboli (see p473). • Carotid endarterectomy: Perform within 2wks of fi rst presentation if 70–99% ste- nosis8 and operative risk is acceptable (higher risk in: , >75y, systolic BP, contralat- eral artery occl uded; ipsilateral carotid syphon/external carotid stenosed). Do not stop aspirin preoperatively. Surgery is preferred to endovascular carotid artery an- gioplasty with stenting in those fi t enough to tolerate due to higher peri-procedure stroke and mortality rates with stenting. Driving Prohibited for at least 1 month, see p158. Prognosis Long-term risks of stroke or cardiovascular events following TIAs are de- pendent on underlying vascular risk factors: calculate using the ABCD2 score (see BOX and table 10.6). 8 Interventions for 50–69% stenoses can be justifi able; individualize risk and check local guidelines. In particular, check which criteria used to estimate degree of stenosis since NASCET (North American Sympto- matic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial) criteria tend to include
