prolonged QT interval see p711. Long QT can lead to VT and sudden death. • ST segment: Usually isoelectric. Planar elevation (>1mm) or depression (>0.5mm) usu- ally implies infarction (p119, fi gs 3.9, 3.10, pp103–4) or ischaemia, respectively. • T wave: Normally inverted in aVR, V1, and occasionally V2. Normal if inverted in isola- tion in lead III. Abnormal if inverted in I, II, and V4–V6. Peaked in hyperkalaemia (fi g 14.4, p675) and fl attened in hypokalaemia. • J wave: See p849. The J point is where the S wave fi nishes and ST segment starts. A J wave is a notch at this point. Seen in hypothermia, SAH, and Ca2+. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 9966 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0066 enicidem ralucsavoidraC 97 Fig 3.3 Schematic diagram of a normal ECG trace.
