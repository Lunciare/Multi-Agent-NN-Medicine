syndrome. Primary (idiopathic) or secondary to: • malignancy: lung, breast, GI, prostate, haematological • infection: hepatitis B/C, Streptococcus, malaria, schistosomiasis • immunological disease: SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, sarcoidosis, Sjögren’s • drugs: gold, penicillamine. Indolent disease with spontaneous remission in ~25%. Diagnosis: Anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibody in 70–80% of idiopathic dis- ease. Diff usely thickened GBM due to subepithelial deposits (IgG4 dominant in idi- opathic, other IgGs in secondary disease). ‘Spikes’ on silver stain. Treatment: ACE-i/ARB and blood pressure control in all. Immunosuppression (‘Ponticelli’ regimen: corticosteroids plus cyclophosphamide/chlorambucil) only in those at high risk of progression (proteinuria >4g without response to ACE-i/ ARB for 6 months, creatinine by 30% in 6–12 months but eGFR still >30). The role of targeted immunosuppression in those positive for anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibodies remains unknown. In secondary disease proteinuria can remit with treatment of the underlying cause. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis ~10% of adult nephrotic syndrome (higher in low- and middle-income countries due to infection). Divided into: • immune-complex associated: driven by increased or abnormal immune com- plexes which deposit in the kidney and activate complement. An underlying cause can be found in most adult cases, eg infection, cryoglobulinaemia, mono- clonal gammopathy, autoimmunity • C3 glomerulopathy: due to
