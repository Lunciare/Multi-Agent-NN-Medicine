Demyelination heals poorly, eventually causing axonal loss; >80% of patients develop progressive disabil- ity. The exact cause of the disease remains unknown; it is most likely a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is >30% concordance in identical twins, and unusual geographical distribution, with increasing incidence with latitude in some parts of the world (NB: adult migrants take their risk with them; children ac- quire the risk of where they settle)—leading to hypotheses of the roles of vitamin D and infection. Mean age of onset is 30yrs. : ≥3:1. Presentation Usually monosymptomatic: ~20% present with unilateral optic neuri- tis (pain on eye movement and rapid central vision).
