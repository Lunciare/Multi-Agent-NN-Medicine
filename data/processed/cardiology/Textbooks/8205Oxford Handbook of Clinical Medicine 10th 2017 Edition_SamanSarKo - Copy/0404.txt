Symptoms and signs: ACS-like symptoms, heart failure symptoms, palpitations, tachycardia, soft S1, S4 gallop (p44).Tests: ECG: ST changes and T-wave inversion, atrial arrhythmias, transient AV block, QT prolongation. Bloods: CRP, ESR, & troponin may be raised; viral serology and tests for other likely causes. Echo: diastolic dysfunction, regional wall abnormalities. Cardiac MR if clinically stable. Endomyocardial biopsy is gold stand- ard. : Supportive. Treat the underlying cause. Treat arrhythmias and heart failure (p136). NSAID use is controversial. Avoid exercise as this can precipitate arrhythmias. Prognosis: 50% will recover within 4wks. 12–25% will develop DCM and severe heart failure. DCM can occur years after apparent recovery. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) A dilated, fl abby heart of unknown cause. Associa- tions: alcohol, BP, chemotherapeutics, haemochromatosis, viral infection, autoim- mune, peri- or postpartum, thyrotoxicosis, congenital (X-linked). Prevalence: 0.2%. Presentation: Fatigue, dyspnoea, pulmonary oedema, RVF, emboli, AF, VT. Signs: Pulse, BP,
