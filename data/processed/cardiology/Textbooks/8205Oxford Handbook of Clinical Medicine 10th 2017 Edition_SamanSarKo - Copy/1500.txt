kg/4h IV over 15min in children <50kg; up to 60mg/kg/d). Caution in liver impair- ment. NSAIDS, eg ibuprofen 400mg/8h PO (see BNFC for dosing in children) are good for musculoskeletal pain and renal or biliary colic. CI: peptic ulcer, clotting disorders, anticoagulants. Cautions: asthma, renal or hepatic impairment, heart failure, IHD, pregnancy, and the elderly. Aspirin is contraindicated in children due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome (OHCS p652). Opioid drugs for severe pain Morphine (eg 10–15mg/2–4h IV/IM) or diamor phine (5–10mg/2–4h PO, SC, or slow IV, but you may need much more) are best. NB: these are ‘controlled’ drugs. For palliative care, see p532. Alternative delivery routes in- clude transdermal (once baseline requirements are established) or sublingual.
