Mexican hats are rather small (microcytic). There is also poikilocytosis (poikilos is Greek for varied—so this simply means that the red blood cells are of varied shape).

Disorders of haemostasis fall into these three groups. The pattern of bleeding is important—vascular and platelet disorders lead to prolonged bleeding from cuts, bleeding into the skin (eg easy bruising and purpura), and bleeding from mucous membranes (eg epistaxis, bleeding from gums, menorrhagia). Coagulation disorders cause delayed bleeding into joints and muscle. 1 Vascular defects Congenital: Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome (p708), conne ctive tissue disease (eg Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, OHCS p642, pseudoxanthoma elasticum). Acquired: Senile purpura, infection (eg meningococcal, measles, dengue fever), steroids, scurvy (perifollicular haemorrhages), Henoch–Schönlein purpura (p702). 2 Platelet disorders Decreased marrow production: Aplastic anaemia (p364), megaloblastic anaemia, marrow infi ltration (eg leukaemia, myeloma), marrow suppression (cytotoxic drugs, radiotherapy). Excess destruction: Immune: im- mune thrombocytopenia (ITP, see BOX ‘Immune thrombocytopenia’), other auto- immune causes, eg SLE, CLL, drugs, eg heparin, viruses; Non-immune: DIC (p352), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), or HUS (p315),
