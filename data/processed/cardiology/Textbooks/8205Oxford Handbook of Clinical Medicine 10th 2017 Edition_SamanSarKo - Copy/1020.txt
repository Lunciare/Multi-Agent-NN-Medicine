psychiatric or cognitive disorder, multi- drug resistant disease, patient request. Universal access to diagnosis and treatment of TB is part of social justice. WHO has developed an ‘End TB’ strategy aiming to reduce TB deaths by 90% by 2030, and TB incidence by 90% by 2035 (www.who.int/tb/strategy/en). Drug-resistant TB NAAT (p394) for drug resistance should be requested for all patients with risk fac- tors for drug-resistance: previous TB treatment, contact with drug-resistant disease, birth or residence in a country where ≥5% new cases are drug resistant (fi g 9.10). Drug resistance may be: • to any single agent in table 9.10. • multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB): resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid. • extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB): resistant to rifampicin, isoniazid, one inject- able agent (capreomycin, kanamycin or amikacin) and one fl uoroquinolone. If rifampicin resistance is detected, treat with at least six agents to which the my- cobacterium is likely to be sensitive. Test for resistance to 2nd-line drugs. Remember infection control measures. Seek expert advice for all drug-resistant cases. Fig 9.10 Percentage of new TB cases with multi-drug resistant TB.
