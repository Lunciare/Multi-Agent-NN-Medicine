hypotension: Unsteadiness or LOC on standing from lying in those with inadequate vasomotor refl exes: the elderly; autonomic neuropathy (p505); antihypertensive medication; overdiuresis; multisys- tem atrophy (MSA; p494). Anxiety: Hyperventilation, tremor, sweating, tachycardia, paraesthesiae, light-headedness, and no LOC suggest a panic attack. Drop attacks: Sudden fall to the ground without LOC. Mostly benign and due to leg weakness but may also be caused by hydrocephalus, cataplexy, or narcolepsy. Factitious black- outs: Pseudoseizures, Münchausen’s (p706). Examination Cardiovascular, neurological. Measure BP lying and standing. Investigation All with recurrent syncope (or falls) need cardiac assessment—ur- gently if associated with palpitations, arrhythmias, 3rd-degree AV block, or pro- longed QT interval (p711). ECG ± 24h ECG (arrhythmia, long QT, eg Romano–Ward, p96); U&E, FBC, Mg2+, Ca2+, glucose; tilt-table test;3 EEG, sleep EEG; echocardiogram; CT/MRI brain; ABG if practical (PaCO2 in attacks suggests hyperventilation as the cause). While the cause is being elucidated, advise against driving (see p158). 3 Patient is subject to continuous ECG and BP monitoring while strapped to a table and moved rapidly from resting horizontal position to vertical. Induction of symptoms with inappropriate BP drop >30mmHg or bradycardia suggests neurally mediated syncope. Consider pacing. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 446600 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0088 ygolorueN Blackout history 461
