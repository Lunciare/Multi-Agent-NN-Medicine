may be required. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP): Must be considered in any patient with ascites who deteriorates suddenly (may be asymptomatic). Common organisms are E. coli, Klebsiella, and streptococci. : eg piperacillin with tazobactam 4.5g/8h for 5d or until sensitivities known. Give prophy- laxis for high-risk patients (albumin, PT/INR, low ascitic albumin) or those who have had a previous episode: eg ciprofl oxacin 500mg PO daily. Encephalopathy: Recurrent episodes may be reduced in frequency with prophylactic lactulose and rifaximin (p274). Renal failure: hepatic clearance of immune complexes leads to trapping in kidneys ( IgA nephropathy ± hepatic glomerulosclerosis). See also p275 for hepato- renal syndrome. Prognosis Overall 5yr survival is ~50%. Poor prognostic indicators: encephalopa- thy; serum Na+ <110mmol/L; serum albumin <25g/L; INR. Liver transplantation is the only defi nitive treatment for cirrhosis (p277). Acute indications: Acute liver failure meeting King’s College criteria (see BOX ‘King’s Col- lege Hospital criteria in acute liver failure’ p275) Chronic indications: Advanced cir- rhosis of any cause; hepatocellular cancer (1 nodule <5cm or ≤5 nodules <3cm). __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 227766 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG 277 Fig 6.27 Spider naevi: a central arteriole, from which numerous vessels radiate (like the legs of a spider).
