Treatment: STEC-HUS: supportive. aHUS: plasma infusion/exchange, eculizumab (anti-C5) in England via the national aHUS centre, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) Symptoms overlap with HUS (see previous paragraph). Pentad: microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, platelets, AKI , neurological symptoms (headache, palsies, sei- zure, confusion, coma), and fever. Due to a congenital defi ciency of, or acquired anti- bodies to, the ADAMTS13 protease which normally cleaves multimers of von Willebrand factor (VWF). Large VWF multimers cause platelet aggregation and fi brin deposition in small vessels, leading to a multisystem thrombotic microangiopathy. Diagnosis: Clinical. ADAMTS13 activity. Treatment: TTP is a haematological emergency: get expert help. Plasma infusion/exchange removes antibodies/replaces ADAMTS13 and may be life-saving. Corticosteroids. Consider rituximab for non-responders/relapse. Atherosclerotic renovascular disease Part of a systemic atheromatous vascular disease including cardio-, cerebro-, and peripheral vascular disease (ask about claudication, check foot pulses), BP, and lipids. Leads to renin–angiotensin upregulation which causes treatment-resistant BP and/or a deterioration in renal function on ACE-i/ARB. Acute decompensated heart failure (no LV impairment on echo) with fl ash pulmonary oedema in up to 10%. Di- agnosis: >1.5cm asymmetry in renal size (but sensitivity and specifi city). Doppler studies of native kidneys not consistently accurate for diagnosis. CT or MR (avoids
