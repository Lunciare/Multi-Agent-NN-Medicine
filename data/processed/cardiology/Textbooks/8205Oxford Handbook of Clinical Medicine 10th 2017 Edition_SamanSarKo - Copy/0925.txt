(fi g 8.50), skin involvement. CNS involvement at presentation is rare. Diagnosis WCC is often , but can be normal or even low. Blast cells may be few in the peripheral blood, so diagnosis depends on bone marrow biopsy, immuno- phenotyping, and molecular methods. On biopsy, AML is diff erentiated from ALL by Auer rods (fi gs 8.51– 8.53). Cytogenetic analysis (eg type of mutation) guides treat- ment recommendations and prognosis. Complications • Predisposition to infection by both the disease and the treat- ment; may be bacterial, fungal, or viral—prophylaxis is given for each during ther- apy. Be alert to septicaemia (p352): common organisms present oddly and rare organisms can infect commonly (particularly the fungi Candida and Aspergillus). Be aware that AML itself causes fever. • Chemotherapy causes plasma urate levels (from tumour lysis)—so give allopurinol with chemotherapy, and keep well hydrat- ed with IV fl uids. • Leukostasis (p352) may occur if WCC. Treatment • Supportive care: As for ALL. Walking exercises can relieve fatigue. • Chemotherapy: Very intensive, resulting in long periods of marrow suppression with neutropenia + platelets . The main drugs used include daunorubicin and cyt arabine, with ~5 cycles given in 1-week blocks to get
