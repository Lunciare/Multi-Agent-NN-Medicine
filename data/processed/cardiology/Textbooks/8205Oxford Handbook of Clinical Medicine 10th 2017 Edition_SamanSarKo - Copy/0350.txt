anticoagulation if stable sinus rhythm has been restored, no risk factors for emboli, and AF recurrence unlikely (ie no failed cardioversions, no structural heart disease, no previous recurrences, no sustained AF for >1yr). Chronic AF: Chronic AF may be paroxysmal (terminates in <7d but may recur), persistent (lasts >7d), or permanent (long-term, continuous AF, sinus rhythm not achievable despite treatment). In all cases, the need for anticoagulation should be assessed using the CHA2DS2-VASc score to assess embolic stroke risk (consider anti- coagulation if score  >0,  >1), and balancing this against the risks of anticoagula- tion to the patient, assessed with the HAS-BLED score. Long-term anticoagulation should be with a DOAC (see p350) or warfarin. CHA2DS2-VASc—Congestive cardiac failure (1 point), Hypertension (1), Age 65–74y (1), Age >74y (2), Diabetes (1), previous Stroke/TIA/thromboembolism (2), Vascular disease (1), Sex Category (1 if female). A score of 2 = an annual stroke risk of 2.2%. Online calculators can be helpful, eg www.mdcalc.com. HAS-BLED—1 point for each of: • labile INR • age >65 • use of medications that can predispose to bleeding (eg NSAIDs, anti-platelets) • alcohol abuse • uncontrolled hypertension • history of, or predisposition to, major bleeding • renal disease
