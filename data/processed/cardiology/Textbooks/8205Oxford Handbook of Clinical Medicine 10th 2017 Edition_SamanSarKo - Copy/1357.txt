In modern- day use, the term refers primarily to the use of cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of cancer. The aim is to deliver enough cytotoxic drug to a cancer-cell target which is expressed diff erently compared to normal tissue. Cytotoxic drugs are given at intervals (cycles of treatment) to allow recovery of normal tissue. Chemotherapy is the only systemic treatment for cancer (surgery and radiotherapy are local treat- ments). This is important as most cancers are considered to be systemic either due to metastases, or the potential to metastasize in the future. Chemotherapy should be prescribed and given only under expert guidance by people trained in its use. Includes: • Single-agent: Rarely curative as genetically resistant cells are selected out. • Combination chemotherapy: A combination of drugs with diff erent mechanisms of action and diff erent side-eff ect profi les reduces the likelihood of resistance and toxicity. The drugs used should have: • cytotoxic activity for that tumour, preferentially able to induce remission • diff erent mechanisms of
