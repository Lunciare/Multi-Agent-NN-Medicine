On occasion, other areas of myocardium will set the pace (see earlier in chapter). If the heart is not pacing itself fast enough, artifi cial pacing may be required. Options include ‘percus- sion pacing’—fi st strikes to the precordium, used only in periarrest situations; trans- cutaneous pacing—electrical stimulation via defi brillator pads (p770); temporary transvenous pacing (p776); and a subcutaneously implanted permanent pacemaker. Indications for temporary cardiac pacing include • Symptomatic bradycardia, unresponsive to atropine. • After acute anterior MI, prophylactic pacing is required in: • complete AV block • Mobitz type I AV block (Wenckebach) • Mobitz type II AV block • non-adjacent bifascicular, or trifascicular block (p100). • After inferior MI, pacing may not be needed in complete AV block if reasonably stable, rate is >40–50, and QRS complexes are narrow. • Suppression of drug-resistant tachyarrhythmias by overdrive pacing, eg SVT, VT. • Special situations: during general anaesthesia; during cardiac surgery; during elec- trophysiological studies; drug overdose (eg digoxin, -blockers, verapamil). See p776 for further details and insertion technique. Indications for a permanent pacemaker (PPM) include
