pen/pencil, sternal pressure (not a rub), or suprascapular squeeze. Abnormal responses to pain can help to localize the damage: • Flexion = decorticate posture (arms bent inwards on chest, thumbs tucked in a clenched fi st, legs extended) implies damage above the level of the red nucleus in the midbrain.1 • Extension = decerebrate posture (adduction and internal rotation of shoulder, pro- nation of forearm) indicates midbrain damage below the level of the red nucleus. NB: an abbreviated coma scale, AVPU, is sometimes used in the initial assessment (‘primary survey’) of the critically ill: A = alert V = responds to vocal stimuli P = responds to pain U = unresponsive NB: GCS scoring is diff erent in young children; see OHCS p201. 1 Red nucleus output reinforces upper limb antigravity fl exion. When its output is damaged, the unregu- lated reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tracts reinforce extension tone of upper and lower limbs.
