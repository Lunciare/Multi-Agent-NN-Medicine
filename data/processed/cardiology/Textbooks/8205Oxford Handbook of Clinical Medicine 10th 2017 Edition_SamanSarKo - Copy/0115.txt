Can be due to radiotherapy, malignant infi ltration, infection, fi lariasis, or rarely primary lymphoedema (Milroy’s syndrome p706). Weight loss Weight loss can be both a symptom (ie reported by the patient) and a sign (identifi ed by physician). A feature of chronic disease, depression, malnutrition, malignancy, chronic infections (eg TB, HIV/enteropathic AIDS), diabetes mellitus, and hyperthy- roidism (typically in the presence of increased appetite). Severe generalized muscle wasting is also seen as part of a number of degenerative neurological diseases and in cardiac failure (cardiac cachexia), although in the latter, right heart failure may not make weight loss a major complaint. Do not forget ano- rexia nervosa (OHCS p382) as an underlying cause of weight loss. Rule out treatable causes, eg diabetes is easy to diagnose—TB can be very hard. For example, the CXR may look like cancer so don’t forget to send bronchoscopy samples for ZN stain and TB culture. Unintentional weight loss should always ring alarm bells, so assess patients carefully. Cachexia General muscle wasting from famine, or eating (dementia; stroke; MND, p506; ano- rexia nervosa), malabsorption (enterop athic
