germ cell tumour, 12%; lymphoma. Signs: Typically painless testis lump, found after trauma/infection ± haemosperm- ia, secondary hydrocele, pain, dyspnoea (lung mets), abdominal mass (enlarged nodes), or eff ects of secreted hormones. 25% of seminomas & 50% of NSGCTS pre- sent with metastases. Risk factors: Undescended testis; infant hernia; infertility. Staging: 1 No evidence of metastasis. 2 Infradiaphragmatic node involvement (spread via the para-aortic nodes not inguinal nodes). 3 Supra diaphragmatic node involvement. 4 Lung involvement (haematogenous). Tests: (Allow staging.) CXR, CT, excision biopsy. -FP (eg >3IU/mL)13 and -hCG are useful tumour markers and help monitor treatment (p531); check before & during . : Radical orchidectomy (inguinal incision; occlude the spermatic cord before mobilization to risk of intra-operative spread). Options are constantly updated (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy). Seminomas are exquisitely radiosensitive. Stage 1 seminomas: orchidectomy + radiotherapy cures ~95%. Do close follow- up to detect relapse. Cure of NSGCT, even if metasta ses are present, is achieved by 3 cycles of bleomycin + etoposide + cisplatin. 5yr survival >90% in all groups. Encourage regular self-examination (prevents late presentation). 13 FP is not  in pure seminoma; may also be  in: hepatitis, cirrhosis, liver cancer, open neural tube defect. __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 665500
