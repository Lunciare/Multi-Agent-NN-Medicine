obscured, examine the red refl ex, with your focus on the margin of the pupil, to look for a cataract. Try to get a view of the fovea by asking the patient to look directly at the ophthalmoscope Pathology here needs prompt oph- thalmic review. If in doubt, ask for slit lamp examination or photography of the retina. • III p, IV, & VI—eye movements. Ask the patient to keep their head still and follow your fi nger as you trace an imaginary ‘H’. IIIrd nerve palsy—ptosis, large pupil, eye down and out. IVth nerve palsy—diplopia on looking down and in (often no- ticed on descending stairs)—head tilting compensates for this (ocular torticollis). VIth nerve palsy—horizontal diplopia on looking out. Nystagmus is involuntary, often jerky, eye oscillations. Horizontal nystagmus is often due to a vestibular le- sion (acute: nystagmus away from lesion; chronic: towards lesion), or cerebellar lesion (unilateral lesions cause nystagmus towards the aff ected side). If it is more in whichever eye is abducting, MS may be the cause (internuclear ophthalmoplegia, see fi g 2.34). If also deafness/tinnitus, suspect a peripheral cause (eg VIIIth nerve lesion, barotrauma, Ménière’s, p462). If it varies with head position, suspect benign positional
