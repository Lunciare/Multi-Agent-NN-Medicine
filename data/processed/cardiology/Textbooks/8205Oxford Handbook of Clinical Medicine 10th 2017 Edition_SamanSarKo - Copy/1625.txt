Diverticulosis means that diverticula are present, and diver- ticular disease implies they are symptomatic. Diverticulitis refers to infl ammation of a diverticulum. Diverticula can be aquired or congenital and may occur elsewhere, but the most important are acquired colonic diverticula, to which this page refers. Pathology Most within sigmoid colon with 95% of complications at this site, but right-sided and massive single diverticula can occur. High intraluminal pressures (due, perhaps, to lack of dietary fi bre) force the mucosa to herniate through the muscle layers of the gut at weak points adjacent to penetrating vessels. 30% of Westerners have diverticulosis by age 60. The majority are asymptomatic. Diagnosis Diverticula are a common incidental fi nding at colonoscopy (fi g 6.11, p249). CT abdomen is best to confi rm acute diverticulitis and can identify extent of disease and any complications (eg colovesical fi stulae). Colonoscopy risk perforation in acute setting. AXR may
