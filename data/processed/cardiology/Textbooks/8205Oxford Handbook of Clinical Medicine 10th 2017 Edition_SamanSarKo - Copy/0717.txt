from serum Na+, creatinine, bilirubin, and INR.29 Post-op: 12–48h on ITU, with enteral feeding starting as soon as possible and close monitoring of LFT. Immunosuppression examples: tacrolimus ± mycophenolate mofetil (or azat hioprine) + prednisolone. Hypera cute rejection is a result of ABO incompatibility. Acute rejection (T-cell mediated, at 5–10d): the patient feels unwell with pyrexia and tender hepatomegaly—often managed by altering the immuno- suppressives. Other complications: sepsis (esp. Gram Ωve and CMV), hepatic artery thrombosis, chronic rejection (at 6–9 months), disease recurrence, and, rarely, graft-versus-host disease. Average patient survival at 1yr is ~80% (5yr survival 60–90%; depends on the pre-op disease). 28 Clues as to which patients with chronic HCV will get cirrhosis: platelet count ≤140 x 109/L, globulin/albu- min ratio ≥1, and AST/ALT ratio ≥1—100% +ve predictive value but lower sensitivity (~30%). 29 Online calculators available, eg at www.odt.nhs.uk __OOHHCCMM__1100ee..iinnddbb 227777 0022//0055//22001177 1199::0077 ygoloretneortsaG 278 Viral hepatitis Hepatitis A RNA virus. Spread: Faecal–oral or shellfi sh. Endemic in Africa and S Amer- ica, so a problem for travellers. Most infections are in childhood. Incubation: 2–6wks. Sympt oms: Fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, arthralgia—then: jaundice (rare in chil- dren), hepatosplenomegaly, and adenopathy. Tests: AST and ALT rise 22–40d after exposure
