AFB are seen, treatment should be commenced and the patient isolated (in hospital only if clinical indication, or public health reason for admission; or at home). • Sputum culture. More sensitive than smear testing. Culture takes 1–3 weeks (liquid media) or 4–8 weeks (solid media). Can assess drug sensitivity. • Nucleic acid amplifi cation test (NAAT). Direct detection of M. tuberculosis in sputum by DNA or RNA amplifi cation. Rapid diagnosis (<8hrs). Can also detect drug resistance (see p395). Extra-pulmonary TB: • Investigate for coexisting pulmonary disease. • Obtain material from aspiration or biopsy (lymph node, pleura, bone, synovium, GI/GU tract) to enable AFB staining, histological examination (caseating granu- loma) and/or culture. • NAAT can be carried out on any sterile body fl uid, eg CSF, pericardial fl uid. Offer HIV test for all. Treatment Antibiotics used in the treatment3 of TB are detailed in table 9.10.
