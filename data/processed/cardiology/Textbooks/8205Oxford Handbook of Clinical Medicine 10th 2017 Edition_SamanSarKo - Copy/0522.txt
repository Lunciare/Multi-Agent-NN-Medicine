What is the best diet for obese patients with type 2 diabetes? Dietary carbohydrate is a big determinant of postprandial glucose levels, and low-carbohydrate diets improve glycaemic control. How do low-carbohydrate, ke- togenic diets (<20g of carbohydrate daily; LCKD) compare with low-glycaemic in- dex, reduced-calorie diet (eg 500kcal/day defi cit from weight maintenance diet)? In one randomized study over 24 weeks, LCKD had greater improvements in HbA1c (Ω15 vs Ω5mmol/L), weight (Ω11kg vs Ω7kg), and HDL. Diabetes drugs were reduced or eliminated in 95% of LCKD vs 62% of LGID participants.6 NB: eff ects on renal func-
