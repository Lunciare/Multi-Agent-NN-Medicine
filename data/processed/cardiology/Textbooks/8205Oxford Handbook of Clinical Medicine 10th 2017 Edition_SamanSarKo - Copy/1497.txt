10s; thiopental is an alternative) or, if airway obstruction or diffi cult IV ac- cess, gaseous (eg sevofl urane or nitrous oxide, mixed in O2). • Airway control: Either using a facemask, an oropharyngeal (Guedel) airway or by intubation. The latter usually requires muscle relaxation with a depolarizing/ non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker (OHCS p622). • Maintenance of anaesthesia: Either a volatile agent added to NO/O mixture, 2 2 or high-dose opiates with mechanical ventilation, or IV infusion anaesthesia (eg propofol 4–12mg/kg/h IVI). • Recovery: Change inspired gases to 100% oxygen only, then discontinue any an- aesthetic infusions and reverse muscle paralysis. Extubate once spontaneously breathing, place patient in recovery position, and give oxygen by facemask. • For further details, see the Anaesthesia chapter in OHCS (p612).  Local anaesthetic toxicity and maximum doses Anaesthetists are masters of the drug dose by weight! It is important to remem- ber the maximum doses for local anaesthetics, not least because we use them so frequently, but because the eff ects of overdose can be lethal. Handy to remember (though it can be worked out with a pen, paper, and SI units) is that a 1% concentration is equivalent to 10mg/mL. Local anaesthetics are also
