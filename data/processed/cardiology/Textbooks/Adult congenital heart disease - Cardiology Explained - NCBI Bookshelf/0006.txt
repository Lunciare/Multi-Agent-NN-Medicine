a low mortality rate. Correction of an ostium primum defect, with its associated anomalies, is more difficult and carries a higher mortality rate. More recently, percutaneous device closure of small and moderate size ASDs has been possible. In this procedure, a "butterfly" device (eg, the Clamshell occluder, the Starflex occluder, or the Amplatzer occluder) is manipulated noninvasively into the heart and "opened", whereupon it grasps the defect on either side and closes it (see Figures 5 and 6). Figure 5 The Clamshell occluder for closure of an atrial septal defect. IVC: inferior vena cava; LA: left atrium; RA: right atrium. Figure 6 The Amplatzer occluder (a) before and (b) after deployment. Primum ASD requires prophylaxis for infective endocarditis, while secundum ASD does not. Eisenmenger syndrome This is the name given to reversal in the direction of a cardiac shunt caused by the development of pulmonary hypertension. It applies regardless of whether the shunt is atrial or ventricular. Initial flow is always from high pressure (left) to low pressure (right), but pulmonary pressure can rise above systemic pressure and cause a reversal of flow. Signs of pulmonary hypertension are RVH, pulmonary systolic click, and loud pulmonary valve closure. CXR shows large
