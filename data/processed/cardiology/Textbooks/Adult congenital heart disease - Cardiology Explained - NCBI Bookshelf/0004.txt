infective endocarditis. Atrial septal defect Three types of atrial septal defect (ASD) can occur: ostium secundum is the most common type (70%). It can be large, but usually does not affect the atrioventricular valves (see Figures 3 and 4) ostium primum – the hole is situated close to the atrioventricular valves and can be associated with an atrioventricular septal defect sinus venosus is a defect situated near the entrance of the superior vena cava (SVC) or inferior vena cava to the right atrium. It is unusual and is often associated with partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage (usually drainage of the right upper lobe into the SVC) Figure 4 Atrial septal defect (ASD) shown by (a) transesophageal echocardiography, and (b) transesophageal Doppler. Pathophysiology The shunt of blood from the left atrium to the right atrium results in: increased volume load and dilatation of the right atrium and right ventricle (RV) increased pulmonary blood flow and enlargement of the pulmonary arteries increase in size of the pulmonary veins reduced filling of the left ventricle (LV) and aorta 2/6 Over time, the aorta and LV shrink, and pulmonary vascular resistance increases and causes Eisenmenger syndrome (see below). Recognizing ASD Most patients with secundum
