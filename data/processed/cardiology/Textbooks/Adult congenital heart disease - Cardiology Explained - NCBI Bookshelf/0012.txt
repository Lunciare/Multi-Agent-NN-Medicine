ASD: atrial septal defect. Ebstein's anomaly Ebstein's anomaly is the downward displacement of a portion of the tricuspid valve with atrialization of a large part of the RV (see Figure 12). There is often an associated ostium secundum ASD. The atrialized portion of the ventricle hinders rather than helps the forward flow of blood and there is tricuspid regurgitation. Occasionally Ebstein's anomaly is asymptomatic, but it generally presents in childhood or early adulthood with dyspnea, fatigue, signs of tricuspid regurgitation, and right-sided cardiac failure. Patients with Ebstein's anomaly require prophylaxis for endocarditis.
