Figure 9 Fallot's tetralogy with an "over-riding aorta". perimembranous VSD RV outflow obstruction (pulmonary stenosis) RVH The chief symptom is cyanosis on exercise. Children typically "squat" for relief of dyspnea after exercise (almost pathognomonic). Chest pain, arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure are more common in adults than in children. Clubbing is common. Surgical correction usually involves resection of the hypertrophied RV infundibulum and VSD closure with incorporation of the aorta into the RV. Adult Fallot's patients often suffer impaired exercise capacity due to poor RV function. Transposition of the great arteries In transposition of the great arteries (TGA), the RV connects to the aorta and the LV connects to the pulmonary artery (see Figure 10). The result, following peripartum closure of the foramen ovale, is two parallel circulations – a physiology that is not compatible with life. The neonate would die instantly were it not for the common coexistence of a patent foramen ovale, ASD, VSD, or PDA. In infants, an improvement in symptoms can be achieved by creating a large defect in the atrial septum to allow mixing of the blood between systemic and pulmonary circulations (Rashkind's procedure – see Figure 11). This is performed by passing a balloon
