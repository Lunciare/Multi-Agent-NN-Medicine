the presenting feature, must be aggressively treated both before and after surgery (it commonly persists). Figure 7 Coarctation of the aorta. Pulmonary valve stenosis Patients with mild to moderate pulmonary stenosis usually remain asymptomatic until the onset of atrial flutter/fibrillation or right heart failure, which lead to breathlessness, ascites, peripheral edema, and a visit to the doctor. Fatigue, slight dyspnea, and effort syncope occur with severe narrowing. The physical signs depend on the severity of the obstruction and secondary effects on RV function. In severe stenosis, the arterial pulse is small and the jugular venous pulse exhibits a large "a" wave. On palpation, there is nearly always a systolic thrill in the second left intercostal space and there is a left parasternal heave. An early systolic "ejection" click and a loud ejection murmur are best heard in the second intercostal space. The second sound is normal in mild cases, but in more severe cases it is widely split and the second (pulmonary) element is soft. ECG shows RVH in severe stenosis, while CXR shows a dilated pulmonary trunk with oligemic lung fields. Balloon valvotomy is indicated in severe pulmonary stenosis. Surgical valvotomy is an alternative. Patent ductus arteriosus Patent ductus
