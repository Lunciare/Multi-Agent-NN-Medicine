defect and ventricular septal defect. Note the wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound in atrial septal defect. With small VSDs, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is normal. With larger ones, there is evidence of biventricular enlargement (tall R waves and deep S waves in leads V1–V6), especially when pulmonary vascular resistance is high. Similarly, with a small defect the chest x-ray (CXR) is normal, but with a large shunt there is cardiomegaly and prominence of the pulmonary vessels. Large shunts should be closed surgically. However, if pulmonary hypertension has developed, surgery is usually contraindicated as closing it may worsen the pulmonary hypertension. The main complication of VSD is infective endocarditis. Vegetations may appear at the tricuspid valve, opposite or around the defect, or on the aortic valve. In certain lesions, aortic incompetence may develop due to loss of support of the valve. The prognosis for adults with uncomplicated VSD is good. Few patients have defects large enough to cause serious hemodynamic problems, but all are exposed to the risk of infective endocarditis. Atrial septal defect Three types of atrial septal defect (ASD) can occur: ostium secundum is the most common type (70%). It can be large, but usually does not
