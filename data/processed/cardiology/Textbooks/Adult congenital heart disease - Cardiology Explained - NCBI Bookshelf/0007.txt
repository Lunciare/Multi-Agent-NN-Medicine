pulmonary pressure can rise above systemic pressure and cause a reversal of flow. Signs of pulmonary hypertension are RVH, pulmonary systolic click, and loud pulmonary valve closure. CXR shows large main pulmonary arteries and branches with peripheral pruning. After the development of Eisenmenger physiology, only heart–lung transplantation is of value in management. Bicuspid aortic valve Bicuspid aortic valves often function normally throughout most of a patient's life. However, fibrosis and calcification ultimately lead to aortic stenosis (see Chapter 9, Valve disease) and an eventual requirement for surgical correction. 3/6 Coarctation of the aorta Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the lumen, usually just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery (see Figure 7). Most commonly, the patient presents in their twenties or thirties, usually with hypertension. Without surgery, 50% die before the age of 30 years. Potential treatments include resection of the narrowed segment with end-to-end anastomosis, repair involving the subclavian artery, and balloon angioplasty – the role of which remains controversial. Hypertension, which is often the presenting feature, must be aggressively treated both before and after surgery (it commonly persists). Figure 7 Coarctation of the aorta.
