stenosis, while CXR shows a dilated pulmonary trunk with oligemic lung fields. Balloon valvotomy is indicated in severe pulmonary stenosis. Surgical valvotomy is an alternative. Patent ductus arteriosus Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) describes a preservation of the connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta that exists in the fetus (see Figure 8). Since aortic diastolic pressure is higher than pulmonary artery systolic pressure, there is continuous flow into the pulmonary circulation, creating the characteristic continuous ("machinery") murmur, heard best just below the left clavicle. In hemodynamically insignificant lesions (>50% of cases), patients are asymptomatic. Patients with bigger shunts develop cardiac failure at an age that depends on the severity of the lesion. Eisenmenger syndrome can occur with PDA. Treatment is surgical closure of the duct; this can be carried out percutaneously. Figure 8 Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Fallot's tetralogy Fallot's tetralogy is one of the causes of cyanotic congenital heart disease. The features derive from an abnormally positioned aorta that "over-rides" the interventricular septum (see Figure 9). This causes: Figure 9 Fallot's tetralogy with an "over-riding aorta". perimembranous VSD RV outflow obstruction (pulmonary stenosis) RVH The chief symptom is cyanosis on exercise. Children typically "squat" for relief of dyspnea
