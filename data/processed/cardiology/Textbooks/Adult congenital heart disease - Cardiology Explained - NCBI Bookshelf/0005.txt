left ventricle (LV) and aorta 2/6 Over time, the aorta and LV shrink, and pulmonary vascular resistance increases and causes Eisenmenger syndrome (see below). Recognizing ASD Most patients with secundum ASD remain asymptomatic throughout their thirties, but visit their doctor in middle-age with the onset of breathlessness and fatigue (note the nonspecific signs). Symptoms are usually progressive and worsened by the development of atrial arrhythmias. Patients with primum ASD tend to present earlier and with more severe symptoms. The classic sign of ASD is wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound, together with a systolic murmur due to high flow across the pulmonary valve (see Table 1). Primum ASD may be accompanied by mitral regurgitation. ECG might indicate RBBB and either RVH and right axis deviation (secundum) or left axis deviation (primum) (see Table 1). CXR may show cardiomegaly with a prominent pulmonary trunk. Management ASDs that are large enough to give clear physical signs should be closed. Closure of an ostium secundum defect is relatively easy and carries a low mortality rate. Correction of an ostium primum defect, with its associated anomalies, is more difficult and carries a higher mortality rate. More recently, percutaneous device closure of small
