large defect in the atrial septum to allow mixing of the blood between systemic and pulmonary circulations (Rashkind's procedure – see Figure 11). This is performed by passing a balloon catheter into the left atrium via the right atrium. After inflation, the balloon catheter is pulled back forcefully into the right atrium, creating a tear in the septum. This procedure is usually effective in the neonatal period and allows the child to live until the latter part of the first year of life, when the Mustard operation can be performed. This involves rerouting venous return by inserting an intra-atrial baffle. The definitive treatment is the arterial switch operation, in which the arteries are switched back to their appropriate ventricles. The biggest challenge with this procedure is reattaching the coronary arteries, the anatomical organization of which is variable in TGA. In addition, the "low pressure" LV must take on filling of the systemic circulation. Figure 10 Transposition of the great arteries (right-hand image).
