Valve disease - Cardiology Explained

a very limited role in older 2 patients. This is because the postoperative valve area is rarely >1 cm and because complications are frequent (10%) and serious. This procedure can act as a "bridge" to reduce the requirement for surgery (with its inherent risk) in adult patients with refractory pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock. Aortic valve replacement in the elderly Due to the limitations of medical therapy and balloon valvotomy, AVR should be considered for all elderly patients with symptomatic AS. However, the decision as to whether to carry out AVR is rarely straightforward and must take into account the risks as viewed by both the surgeon and the patient. Comorbidity in the form of LVH or CAD greatly increases the risk associated with 3/13 surgery. In addition, specific valve problems, such as heavy calcification and narrow LV outflow tract or annulus, make the procedure more complex. The decision is highly individual. Aortic regurgitation AR is associated with classic clinical signs (see Table 2): waterhammer (collapsing) pulse – detected by comparing the character of the radial pulse at the level of the heart with its character on elevation of the arm (use several fingers). Elevation accentuates the steep rise-and-fall character
