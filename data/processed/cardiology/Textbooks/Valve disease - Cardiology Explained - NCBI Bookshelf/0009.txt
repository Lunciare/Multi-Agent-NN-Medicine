Valve disease - Cardiology Explained

comparing the character of the radial pulse at the level of the heart with its character on elevation of the arm (use several fingers). Elevation accentuates the steep rise-and-fall character of this pulse, which seems to slap faster and harder against the fingers Corrigan's sign – visible arterial pulsation in the neck de Musset's sign – nodding of the head in time with the heartbeat Duroziez's sign – caused by retrograde diastolic flow in the femoral artery. Place the stethoscope on the femoral pulse and occlude the artery distally. The turbulent flow will be picked up as a "to-and-fro" murmur Quincke's sign – capillary pulsation in the nail beds that is visible on applying gentle pressure to induce a degree of whitening Traube's sign – a "pistol-shot" sound heard over the femoral pulse Müller's sign – pulsation of the uvula An early diastolic murmur is heard at the left lower sternal edge when the patient is sitting forward and holding his or her breath in expiration. There could also be a coexistent aortic systolic flow murmur, caused by the large stroke volume (rather than reflecting organic AS). There may be a mid diastolic murmur at the apex (Austin Flint murmur)
