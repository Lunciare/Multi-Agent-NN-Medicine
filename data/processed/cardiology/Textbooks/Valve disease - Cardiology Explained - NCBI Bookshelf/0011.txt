Valve disease - Cardiology Explained

helpful in reducing preload and afterload, possibly in combination with dobutamine or dopamine. Intra-aortic balloon pumping is absolutely contraindicated (it increases aortic diastolic pressure and worsens the regurgitation), while β-blockers, often used in the management of dissection, should be used with caution in associated acute severe AR as they dampen the compensatory tachycardia. Chronic aortic regurgitation An early diastolic murmur is always justification for referral to a cardiologist for assessment and echo. Causes Rheumatic involvement of the aortic valve, resulting in thickening of the cusps and fusion of the commissures – the valve neither opens nor closes completely. 4/13 Dilatation of the aortic root resulting from aneurysm of the ascending aorta – this is commonly seen in Marfan's syndrome. Dilatation of the aortic annulus can also result from connective tissue disease, such as ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter's syndrome, relapsing polychondritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus. Dissecting aneurysm involving the aortic root. Syphilitic aortitis causing aortic aneurysm and dilatation of the valve ring that may involve the coronary ostia. Table 2 outlines the causes of aortic regurgitation. Natural history and therapeutic options Chronic AR represents a condition of combined volume and pressure overload on the LV. The ejection fraction (EF) –
