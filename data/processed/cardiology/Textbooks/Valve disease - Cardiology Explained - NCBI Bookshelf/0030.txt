Valve disease - Cardiology Explained

peaks between the second and third trimesters, predominantly due to an increase in stroke volume, although the heart rate also increases by up to 20%. Total peripheral resistance falls disproportionately, reducing the diastolic blood pressure and widening the pulse pressure. Occasionally, in the supine position the inferior vena cava can be compressed by a gravid uterus, leading to an abrupt decrease in venous return. This can result in light headedness, but quickly resolves on changing position. The increased blood volume and cardiac output can accentuate stenotic murmurs, while the lowered peripheral resistance can actually reduce regurgitant murmurs. In general, echo demonstrates a degree of "physiological" chamber enlargement that, in a significant minority of women, may be associated with functional MR. In some conditions (eg, cyanotic heart disease, Eisenmenger syndrome, and severe pulmonary hypertension), the changes resulting from pregnancy greatly increase risk and most cardiologists would counsel against pregnancy. The following are also associated with increased risk, either to the mother or fetus: severe AS MR/AR with class III–IV symptoms MS with class II–IV symptoms pulmonary pressures >75% of systemic EF <40% mechanical prosthetic valves requiring anticoagulation AR in Marfan's syndrome Although risk is increased, many patients with valvular abnormalities can
