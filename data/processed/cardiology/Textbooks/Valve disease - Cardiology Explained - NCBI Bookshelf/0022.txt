Valve disease - Cardiology Explained

dilatation to push the LV onto the downward portion of the Frank–Starling curve and dysfunction results (see Figure 7). Importantly, the loading conditions mean that this dysfunction might not be reflected in an abnormal EF (the EF in a patient with MR and normal LV function is >60%). Figure 7 Frank–Starling curve showing left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Asymptomatic patients with mild MR and no evidence of LV dilatation or dysfunction can be followed on a yearly basis and undergo echo less frequently than that. Asymptomatic patients with moderate MR should have an echo annually. Asymptomatic patients with severe MR should be followed up every 6–12 months and undergo echo to detect silent LV dysfunction. Exercise testing is useful to document changes in exercise tolerance. The timing of surgery is determined by the EF, LV end systolic dimension (LVESD), the presence of AF, and symptoms. It is indicated for those with: class II–IV symptoms, EF >60%, LVESD <45 mm EF 30%–60%, LVESD 45–55 mm (regardless of symptoms) asymptomatic patients with AF and normal EF symptomatic patients with normal EF and pulmonary hypertension (>50 mm Hg) asymptomatic patients with EF 50%–60% and LVESD <45 mm, or EF >60% and LVESD 45–55 mm
