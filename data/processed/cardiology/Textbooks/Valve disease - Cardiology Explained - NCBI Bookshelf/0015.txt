every 6–12 months. Mitral stenosis The MV apparatus consists of three components: two leaflets, the fibrous annulus, and the chordae tendineae, which connect the leaflets to the papillary muscles (see Figure 1). The anterior leaflet is larger than the posterior leaflet (see Figure 2). The normal area of the MV orifice is 4–5 cm2. Symptoms of mitral stenosis (MS) develop when the orifice is <2.5 cm2 and a 2 critical stenosis occurs when it is approximately 1 cm (see Figure 3). The signs and causes of MS are outlined in Table 3. Figure 1 The structure of the mitral valve apparatus. Figure 2 A calcified mitral valve posterior leaflet in diastole. Figure 3 Mitral stenosis with left atrial dilatation. This figure shows a thickened mital valve arrow. The spontaneous contrast is a good illustration of the thrombogenicity of the blood in the left atrium. This is believed to be the first step before the formation (more...) Table 3 Common murmurs in mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation with their associated signs and causes. Causes Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of MS, although it pre-dates the symptoms by at least 10 years. Other acquired causes are rare – eg,
