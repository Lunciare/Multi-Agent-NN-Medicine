percutaneous and surgical therapy are outlined in Table 5. Table 5 Current recommendations for surgical therapy. Medical therapy Prophylaxis against rheumatic fever and endocarditis should be considered for all patients with MS. Agents with negative chronotropic properties, such as β-blockers or calcium-channel blockers, may benefit those in sinus rhythm with symptoms relating to exertional tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation AF develops in 40% of patients with symptomatic MS and should be treated according to standard protocols (see Chapter 8, Arrhythmia). The value of anticoagulation therapy for those with AF and those with a prior embolic event with or without AF is clear. However, there is no evidence that oral anticoagulation is beneficial in those with MS who have neither AF nor a prior embolic event. The frequency of embolic events does not seem to be related to the severity of MS, the size of the LA, or the presence of symptoms. There is some controversy over whether 7/13 percutaneous mitral valvotomy should be performed in patients with new-onset AF and moderate or severe MS who are otherwise asymptomatic. Mitral regurgitation Acute mitral regurgitation In acute severe mitral regurgitation (MR), the hemodynamic changes are not tolerated and the result is generally acute decompensation.
