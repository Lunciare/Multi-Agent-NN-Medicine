and causes. Causes Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of MS, although it pre-dates the symptoms by at least 10 years. Other acquired causes are rare – eg, annular calcification, endocarditis, or granulomatous infiltration in association with eosinophilia. Signs Symptoms of MS generally occur during exertion, infection, stress, or with the onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response. This is because a left atrial (LA) pressure that 6/13 is normal at rest rises with an increase in transmitral flow or a decrease in the diastolic filling time. The most common manifestation is breathlessness, but a reduction in exercise tolerance or symptoms of right-sided congestion can also occur. The typical physical signs are described in Table 4. Figure 4 demonstrates MS in echo, electrocardiography pressure tracing, and a chest x- ray. Table 4 The typical physical signs of mitral stenosis. Figure 4 Mitral stenosis demonstrated by (a) echocardiography (showing thickened leaflets that no longer open), (b) electrocardiography pressure tracing in the left atrium versus left ventricle demonstrating the gradient between the two cavities (and therefore (more...) Natural history The disease takes a slow course with progressive acceleration later in life. In developed countries, the lag period
