a coexistent aortic systolic flow murmur, caused by the large stroke volume (rather than reflecting organic AS). There may be a mid diastolic murmur at the apex (Austin Flint murmur) caused by the regurgitant aortic jet vibrating the anterior mitral valve (MV) leaflet. Acute aortic regurgitation Acute AR is one hallmark of aortic dissection and is a medical emergency in its own right. A large regurgitant volume is suddenly imposed on an LV of normal size that has not had time to accommodate to the volume overload. The result is a reduction in stroke volume, compensatory tachycardia, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock. Characteristic clinical findings are absent and an echo is essential to document the severity of the lesion. This is done by assessing the speed of equilibration of aortic and LV pressures in diastole. Useful echo measures are short regurgitant wave half time, short mitral deceleration time, and premature closure of the MV. Mortality is high in acute severe AR and early surgical intervention is essential. Nitroprusside can be helpful in reducing preload and afterload, possibly in combination with dobutamine or dopamine. Intra-aortic balloon pumping is absolutely contraindicated (it increases aortic diastolic pressure and worsens the regurgitation), while β-blockers,
