In developed countries, the lag period from the time of rheumatic fever to the onset of symptoms is 20–40 years, and there is another 10 years before these symptoms become disabling. The 10-year survival rate is high for asymptomatic patients (>80%), but low for those with symptoms (0%– 2 15%). Asymptomatic patients with mild MS (MV area >1.5 cm ) require no further evaluation and do not need to be followed up more than annually. Percutaneous and surgical therapy Decisions on therapy are made by joint consideration of symptoms and MV morphology (including hemodynamics and pulmonary artery pressure). Therapeutic options include MV repair (open/closed commissurotomy), MV replacement, and percutaneous valvotomy. Both repair and percutaneous valvotomy acutely result in a doubling of the valve area and a 60% reduction in transmitral gradient. However, open commissurotomy and percutaneous valvotomy produce better long-term hemodynamic results. The current recommendations for percutaneous and surgical therapy are outlined in Table 5.
