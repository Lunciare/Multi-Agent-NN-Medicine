a pin at one end of a beam could be heard distinctly at the opposite end, induced him at the moment, to avail himself of this acoustic phenomenon. He took a quire of paper, rolled it tightly together, applied one extremity over the region of the heart, and putting the ear to the other, was surprised to find that he could distinguish the pulsation of the heart in a more distinct 2/13 manner than he could before do with the naked ear. Having hit upon the principle he extended its application to the investigation of the various sounds produced in the chest by the respiration, the voice, and the accidental presence of fluids in the lung, pleural sac, and pericardium." Mediate Auscultation, 1816. (Quoted in The Lancet 1998;352:997.) a Corpulence, physically bulky. Severe stenosis causes a transvalvular pressure gradient of >50 mm Hg in the presence of normal transvalvular flow (ie, normal LV function). However, abnormally low pressure gradients are found in conditions of LV dysfunction, so the gradient alone is not a clear guide. The natural history of AS is one of slow progression. Studies suggest that some patients exhibit a decrease in valve area of 0.1–0.3 cm2/year, although
