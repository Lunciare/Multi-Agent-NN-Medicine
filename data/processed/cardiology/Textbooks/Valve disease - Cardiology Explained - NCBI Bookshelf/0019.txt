severe MS who are otherwise asymptomatic. Mitral regurgitation Acute mitral regurgitation In acute severe mitral regurgitation (MR), the hemodynamic changes are not tolerated and the result is generally acute decompensation. Without time for compensatory LV and LA dilatation, the increase in ventricular preload leads to a decreased stroke volume and pulmonary congestion. However, examination findings may not be typical: there may be no hyperdynamic apex beat the systolic murmur may be short there may be a fourth heart sound The most common cause of acute MR is papillary muscle rupture secondary to myocardial infarction (MI) (see Figure 5). In this situation, the principal differential diagnosis is ventricular septal defect and an echo is required to differentiate between the two. Ventricular septal defect is more likely with: Figure 5 (a) Transesophageal echocardiography showing a tear in the papillary muscle (the most common cause of acute mitral regurgitation).
