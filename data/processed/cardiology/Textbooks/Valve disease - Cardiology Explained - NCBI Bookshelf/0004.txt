Investigation and management Echo is the diagnostic tool of choice for valve disease – in particular, Doppler measurement of valve gradients can quantify lesions. Significant hemodynamic changes do not occur until the aortic valve area has been reduced to a quarter of its normal size (the normal orifice is 3–4 cm2). AS is classed as: mild if the area is >1.5 cm2 2 moderate if the area is 1–1.5 cm 2 severe if the area is <1 cm The Invention of the Stethoscope "In the summer of 1816, Laennec was called to a young lady who presented the general symptoms of disease of the heart; the application of the hand to the chest and percussion afforded very little assistance, and immediate auscultation was interdicted by the sex and a embonpoint of the patient.
