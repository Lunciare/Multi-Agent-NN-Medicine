the episodes. Functional mitral regurgitation The normal function of the MV depends on the cusps, ring, and subvalvular apparatus, including papillary muscle fibers and the circumferential muscle layer supporting the mitral ring. Each of these components plays a significant role in maintaining the competence of the valve. With papillary muscle dysfunction due to ischemia or other causes of ventricular disease, cusp closure is not complete, leading to some degree of regurgitation. This can even occur, for example, in athletic hypertrophy. This is usually mild, but can be significant in rare cases. In such conditions, the heart rate is usually fast and the duration of MR long enough to compromise filling time and hence cardiac output. Although functional in origin, it can be hemodynamically significant. Alfred de Musset a "La bouche garde le silence, Pour écouter parler le coeur." Alfred de Musset (1810–1857), La Nuit de Mai The French romantic poet and playwright, Alfred de Musset (1810–1857), was famous for both his creative brain and his pathological heart. His most inspiring work was prompted by the ending of a love affair he had with George Sand (a French romantic writer who later had a 10-year relationship with Chopin). During a visit
