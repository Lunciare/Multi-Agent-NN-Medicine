Valve disease - Cardiology Explained

radiation of murmur raised jugular venous pressure (JVP) anterior MI (inferior MI is more likely to cause acute MR) The goal of medical therapy in acute severe MR is to diminish regurgitation, increase stroke volume, and reduce pulmonary congestion. As such, nitroprusside alone or in combination with dobutamine (if blood pressure is low) can be effective. Intra-aortic balloon pumping can also help to achieve these goals. In many cases, emergency surgery is warranted. If so, prior transesophageal echo helps to characterize the anatomy and severity of the lesion. Cardiac catheterization should be performed if the patient is at high risk for CAD. Chronic mitral regurgitation Causes Degenerative MV disease is common in the elderly. The valve leaflets are thickened, redundant, increased in area, and they prolapse into the LA in systole. The chordae may become elongated, thinned, and tortuous – predisposing to rupture. Infective endocarditis is a major cause of chronic MR. Vegetations developing on the cusp vary from small nodules along the line of apposition to large friable masses of up to 10 mm or more (see Figure 6). "Jet" lesions on the anterior cusp of the MV can also occur in association with aortic valve endocarditis. Ischemia. 8/13
