valvular abnormality. It affects 2%–6% of the population and is defined as a backward movement of one or both leaflets of the MV (usually the anterior) into the LA during (ventricular) systole. In most cases it is associated with trivial MR. However, as a result of its prevalence, it is also the most common single cause of significant MR. Although MVP does not alter life expectancy, all of the above complications of MR can occur. Sudden death, often reported as an association with MVP, is rare (<2% on long-term follow-up). Classic findings on auscultation are a mid systolic click followed by a late systolic murmur. The click is thought to be caused by a tensing of the MV apparatus as the leaflets prolapse into the LA. The murmur is usually high pitched and loudest at the apex. Certain maneuvers can help to secure the diagnosis: standing reduces end diastolic volume (EDV), bringing the click–murmur 10/13 nearer to the first heart sound; squatting increases EDV (and afterload), moving the click– murmur nearer to the second heart sound. Patients with these findings should be referred for echo assessment. Interestingly, there is no absolute consensus on criteria for diagnosing MVP on two-dimensional echo.
