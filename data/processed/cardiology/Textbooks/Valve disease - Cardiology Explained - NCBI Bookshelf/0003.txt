Valve disease - Cardiology Explained

by clinical signs suggestive of AS diastolic continuous Aortic stenosis 1/13 Causes Congenital aortic stenosis Congenital AS is usually due to a bicuspid valve. A bicuspid valve in itself does not give rise to significant hemodynamic abnormality, but it has a tendency to calcify and a predisposition to infective endocarditis (see Table 2). Table 2 Clinical signs in aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation. Rheumatic aortic stenosis Rheumatic AS results from cusp fusion and calcification many years following rheumatic fever. Senile aortic stenosis Senile, or degenerative, AS results from calcium deposition on the aortic surface of the valve. This is becoming an increasingly important disability problem in the elderly. Physical signs The carotid pulse is slow rising with reduced amplitude. The venous pressure is usually normal until late in the disease. The apex beat is sustained and can be doubled due to an additional atrial component. On auscultation, the second heart sound is single when the valve is calcified due to a lack of aortic component. The classic ejection systolic murmur, which can radiate to one or both carotids, is usually heard best over the aortic area. A soft, early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation (AR) often coexists. Investigation and management
