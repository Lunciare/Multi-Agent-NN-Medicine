Valve disease - Cardiology Explained

open chest bypass grafting for coexisting coronary artery disease (CAD), the opportunity should be taken to carry out aortic valve replacement (AVR) – regardless of whether or not AS symptoms are evident. The merit of carrying out a concomitant AVR is less clear for those with mild or moderate AS. Cardiac catheterization is only indicated in AS for two reasons: (1) to perform coronary angiography before AVR in patients with risk factors for CAD; (2) to assess the severity of AS in symptomatic patients when AVR is planned or when noninvasive tests are inconclusive (catheterization allows accurate quantification of the orifice because it can account for transvalvular flow). Contrary to popular belief, exercise testing is not contraindicated for mild to moderate AS patients and can give useful information with respect to exercise capacity, heart rate recovery, and exercise-induced rise in blood pressure. Balloon valvotomy Percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy (stretching a stenotic valve by balloon inflation) has an important role to play in the treatment of young adults with AS, but a very limited role in older 2 patients. This is because the postoperative valve area is rarely >1 cm and because complications are frequent (10%) and serious. This procedure can
