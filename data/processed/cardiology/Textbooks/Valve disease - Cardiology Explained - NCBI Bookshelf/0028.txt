is in intravenous drug abusers, where right-sided endocarditis is more common. Perhaps the most common cause of tricuspid valve incompetence, however, is elevated right ventricular (RV) pressure, secondary to pulmonary hypertension, MS, pulmonary stenosis, dilated cardiomyopathy, or RV failure. In addition, rheumatic heart disease can affect the tricuspid valve and tends to produce a combination of tricuspid stenosis and regurgitation – the overriding symptoms are those of regurgitation. Ebstein's anomaly is a congenital disorder affecting the tricuspid valve (see Chapter 14, Adult congenital heart disease). Clinical signs Physical examination is key to the diagnosis of tricuspid regurgitation. Typical signs are: gross fluid retention significant peripheral edema ascites that may result in nausea raised JVP with a prominent systolic wave and sharp Y descent parasternal heave and loud P2, suggesting pulmonary hypertension as a cause an enlarged, tender, pulsatile liver and, occasionally, mild jaundice a pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal edge that is increased by inspiration Management Severe tricuspid regurgitation resulting from any cause is associated with a poor long-term outcome due to RV dysfunction and systemic venous congestion. The timing of surgery and the most suitable operation remain controversial, although chordal reconstruction and annuloplasty have become established in
