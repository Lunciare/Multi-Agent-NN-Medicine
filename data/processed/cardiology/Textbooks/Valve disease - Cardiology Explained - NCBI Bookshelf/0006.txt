is not a clear guide. The natural history of AS is one of slow progression. Studies suggest that some patients exhibit a decrease in valve area of 0.1–0.3 cm2/year, although no progression is discernible in many patients. However, regardless of the individual variability, symptoms of angina, syncope, or heart failure generally develop after a latent period. At this point, the outlook changes dramatically. After the onset of symptoms, the average survival is less than 3 years. Thus, development of symptoms is the critical point in the natural history of AS and thereafter the benefits of surgery outweigh the risk. Consequently, asymptomatic AS patients should be monitored closely. Although there is no clear consensus, most cardiologists follow-up mild AS annually (together with 5-yearly echos); moderate AS every 6 months (together with 2-yearly echos); and severe AS more frequently (together with annual echos). If a patient with AS presents with a change in symptoms, their next appointment at the cardiology clinic should be expedited. If a patient with severe AS is undergoing open chest bypass grafting for coexisting coronary artery disease (CAD), the opportunity should be taken to carry out aortic valve replacement (AVR) – regardless of whether or not AS symptoms
