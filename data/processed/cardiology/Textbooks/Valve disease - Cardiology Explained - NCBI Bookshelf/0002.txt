Valve disease - Cardiology Explained

most common is the mid systolic 2/6 murmur (grade II – see Table 1). For children and young adults with an asymptomatic mid systolic murmur, a negative history and a negative physical exam are sufficient to exclude sinister pathology in most cases. Table 1 Grading of murmurs. In the elderly, it is important to differentiate between the common and benign aortic sclerosis and the less common and less benign aortic stenosis (AS). As such, close attention should be paid to the cardiac exam. In particular, AS is indicated by: murmur radiation the presence of a thrill a soft second heart sound In addition, an electrocardiogram should be carried out to screen for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), ischemia, and atrial size or conduction abnormalities. If none of the above is present and the patient remains asymptomatic, the most likely diagnosis is aortic sclerosis and no echo is required. Referral is warranted when a murmur in an asymptomatic patient is: systolic and grade III or above late systolic mid systolic and accompanied by clinical signs suggestive of AS diastolic continuous Aortic stenosis 1/13 Causes Congenital aortic stenosis Congenital AS is usually due to a bicuspid valve. A bicuspid valve in itself does
