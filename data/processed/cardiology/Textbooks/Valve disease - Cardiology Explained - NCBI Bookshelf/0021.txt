Valve disease - Cardiology Explained

of up to 10 mm or more (see Figure 6). "Jet" lesions on the anterior cusp of the MV can also occur in association with aortic valve endocarditis. Ischemia. 8/13 Figure 6 Echocardiogram showing a vegetation on the mitral valve (arrow). Clinical signs The clinical signs of chronic MR are outlined in Table 6. With severe MR, the regurgitant murmur is usually short and stops at the same time as aortic valve closure. Occasionally, the murmur can hardly be heard due to early equalization of atrioventricular pressures. The signs and causes of MR are outlined in Table 3. Table 6 The clinical signs of chronic mitral regurgitation. Natural history In chronic MR, the increased preload and decreased afterload of the LV (caused by ejection of some of the stroke volume into the LA) are compensated for by LV and LA dilatation, and the total stroke volume is increased (the EF is also maintained). This compensated phase of chronic MR may last for years. Eventually, however, the volume overload causes sufficient dilatation to push the LV onto the downward portion of the Frank–Starling curve and dysfunction results (see Figure 7). Importantly, the loading conditions mean that this dysfunction might not be
