Mitral stenosis Penicillin prophylaxis should be continued in pregnant women with MS. The cautious use of diuretics and β-blockers in those with mild to moderate disease can prevent tachycardia and optimize diastolic filling. For women with severe disease, a percutaneous balloon valvotomy prior to conception should be considered. Those who develop class III–IV symptoms during pregnancy should also undergo valvotomy. This can be achieved with very limited fluoroscopy or appropriate shielding. Mitral regurgitation The usual cause of MR is MVP; this rarely requires treatment. Aortic stenosis 12/13 The most likely cause of AS in a woman of childbearing age is congenital bicuspid disease. Mild to moderate obstruction can be managed conservatively throughout pregnancy, whereas those with severe disease (eg, gradient >50 mm Hg, LV function likely to be normal) should be advised to delay conception until treatment is obtained. Aortic regurgitation AR can usually be managed medically with a combination of diuretics and vasodilator therapy. As with
