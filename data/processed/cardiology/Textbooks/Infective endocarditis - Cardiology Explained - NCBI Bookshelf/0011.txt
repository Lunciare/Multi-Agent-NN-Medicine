Infective endocarditis - Cardiology Explained

can be initiated right after completion of blood culturing, once microbiology tests have identified a specific organism and the antibiotic therapy has been modified accordingly. Antibiotic therapy can have an enormous impact on the patient's prognosis; therefore, all efforts have to be made to collect and culture specimens as carefully as possible. This ensures the correct identification of the causative micro-organisms, and ultimately the correct use of antibiotics. Echocardiography This is the key investigation as it can assess underlying cardiac function as well as demonstrate vegetations. Chamber size, pre-existing rheumatic disease, and valve apparatus can be examined and the degree of valve incompetence assessed. Transthoracic two-dimensional echo can detect vegetations above 2 mm in diameter, whereas TEE has greater precision in detection of lesions (1–1.5 mm), with a sensitivity and specificity of over 90% (see Figure 3). Detection of prosthetic endocarditis is more sensitive with TEE. Figure 3 Transesophageal echo for 1 mm lesions. Other investigations Other investigations include the following: blood count – normochromic normocytic anemia is usual, while neutrophil leucocytosis is common ESR – this may be raised renal and liver function test – levels of creatinine may be raised; levels of liver enzymes may be raised in
