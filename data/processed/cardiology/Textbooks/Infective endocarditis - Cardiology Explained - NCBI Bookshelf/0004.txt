Duke criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis (IE). two major criteria; or one major and three minor criteria; or five minor criteria These criteria are associated with a 99% specificity for diagnosis in follow-up studies. It has been proposed that the minor criteria be extended to include erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), splenomegaly, microscopic hematuria, and newly diagnosed clubbing. This adjustment increases diagnostic sensitivity by 10%. Intravenous drug abuse Right-sided endocarditis is common in intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs) because of nonsterile injection into the venous system. The presentation tends to differ from that of classic IE, in that these patients are more likely to develop pneumonia or septic pulmonary emboli than the characteristic signs mentioned above (which result from left-sided embolization). In addition, predominant right-sided failure is more common (look for significantly raised jugular venous pressure and gross peripheral edema). The tricuspid valve is most commonly affected (50%), 2/7 whereas involvement of the mitral and aortic valves is less common (20% each). The involvement of multiple valves is common. Pulmonary valve endocarditis is rare. Etiology IE has a large number of causative organisms. Streptococci These account for 50%–80% of IE cases. Streptococcus viridans (eg, S. anguis,
