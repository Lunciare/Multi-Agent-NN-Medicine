Skin lesions Endocarditis is indicated by: Osler's nodes – tender lesions found on finger pulps and thenar/hypothenar eminences (see Figure 1) Janeway lesions – transient, nontender macular papules on palms or soles splinter hemorrhages petechiae (embolic or vasculitic) clubbing – in long-standing disease Figure 1 Osler's nodes on a finger and foot. Eyes Roth spots (boat-shaped hemorrhages with pale centers, in retina) and conjunctival splinter hemorrhages may be found. Splenomegaly Splenic infarction may occur as a result of emboli. In this case, splenic palpation may be painful and tender, and a rub may be heard. Neurological An acute confusional state is common in patients with infective endocarditis (IE). Cerebral emboli, which usually affect the middle cerebral artery, result in hemiplegia and sensory dysfunction. Mycotic aneurysms also affect the middle cerebral artery, where rupture may cause a subarachnoid hematoma. Mycotic aneurysms can occur several years after endocarditis has been treated. Renal Infarction causes loin pain and hematuria. Immune complex deposition may result in glomerulonephritis. Osler's Nodes William Osler, 1909, on the eponymous Osler's nodes: "One of the most interesting features of [endocarditis] and one to which very little attention has been paid is the occurrence of ephemeral spots of a painful
