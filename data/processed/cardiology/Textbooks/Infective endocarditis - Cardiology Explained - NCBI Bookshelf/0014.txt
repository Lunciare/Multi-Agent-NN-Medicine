the treatment of IE, from any source, fever may still be present 2 weeks after starting the appropriate treatment, even with drug-sensitive organisms. This could be due to the presence of an underlying large vegetation or abscess. If fever persists, the sensitivity of the infecting organism should be checked and drug levels monitored. Repeat echo should be performed to exclude increasing vegetation size or abscess formation. If, despite these measures, the fever remains, the possibility of antibiotic resistance should be considered and a further synergistic antimicrobial treatment may be required. A second site for fever should always be excluded. Surgical intervention Surgical intervention may be required in patients with persistent fever that is resistant to medical therapy. Surgery is also indicated in the following conditions: valve obstruction prosthetic-valve endocarditis caused by S. aureus or resistant organisms aortic or mitral regurgitation not responding to medical therapy paravalvular abscess development of an aneurysm of a sinus of Valsalva fungal endocarditis multiple embolic episodes progressive heart failure secondary to severe valve destruction oscillating vegetation of >1 cm Surgery may involve not only valve replacement, but also aortic root replacement for aortic root abscesses.
