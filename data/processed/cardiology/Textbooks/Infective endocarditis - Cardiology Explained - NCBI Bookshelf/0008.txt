Infective endocarditis - Cardiology Explained

a previously normal heart – the majority (60%) of IE patients have a predisposing cardiac condition. Vegetations usually affect the left side of the heart, with the most common underlying lesions being mitral valve prolapse and degenerative mitral and aortic regurgitation (see Figure 2). Figure 2 Mitral valve vegetation. Rheumatic disease is a risk factor for the development of endocarditis. Other predisposing cardiac lesions include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with associated mitral reflux, subaortic stenosis, and ventricular aneurysm. There are also congenital lesions that predispose adults to endocarditis: these include ventricular septal defect (VSD), bicuspid aortic valve, and coarctation of the aorta. Vegetations occur when a high-pressure jet enters a low-pressure cavity through a narrow orifice. This explains why endocarditis complicates a small VSD, but is not associated with a large VSD, mitral stenosis, or an atrial septal defect. In the presence of a VSD, vegetations can be found on the right ventricular side of the VSD, on the tricuspid valve, or where the jet impinges on the right ventricular wall. Vegetations found in coarctation usually occur distal to the obstruction. Finally, in children, cyanotic heart disease is still the most common cause of endocarditis, and the risk does not diminish after
