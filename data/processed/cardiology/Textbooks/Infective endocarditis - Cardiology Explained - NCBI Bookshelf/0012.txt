Infective endocarditis - Cardiology Explained

neutrophil leucocytosis is common ESR – this may be raised renal and liver function test – levels of creatinine may be raised; levels of liver enzymes may be raised in a hepatocellular (nonobstructive) pattern CRP – increases acutely in bacterial infection urine microscopy – microscopic hematuria is common in early disease culture – culture any skin lesion, drip site, or other focus of infection electrocardiography (ECG) – ECG regularly (daily if aortic or septal root abscess is suspected) Treatment Antibiotics If, following blood cultures, the diagnosis is secure, high-dose IV antibiotics should be started immediately. It is becoming increasingly common to insert a tunneled central line to facilitate 5/7 several weeks of IV treatment without the need for repeated cannulation – with the pain and attendant risk of secondary infection that this incurs. Native valve endocarditis with a subacute onset is most likely to be caused by S. viridans or an enterococcal species. Treatment involves IV penicillin (2.4 g, 4 hourly) for up to 4 weeks, with gentamicin (1 mg/kg, 12 hourly) for 2 weeks. If the onset is acute, staphylococci need to be covered and treatment should include IV cloxacillin (flucloxacillin) (3 g, 6 hourly, in place of penicillin)
