Chapter 10 Infective endocarditis Background Endocarditis was first described by William Osler in 1885. It is an inflammatory process that affects the endocardium and may have an infective or noninfective (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) origin. It is uncommon in the western world (22 cases per million), but more prevalent in developing countries. Diagnosis Symptoms Endocarditis is rarely an obvious diagnosis for a generalist. It may present with a wide variety of clinical signs, some subtle; the diagnosis may be difficult or the signs misleading, and there is a wide differential diagnosis to consider. However, there is a wealth of clinical signs to look for.
