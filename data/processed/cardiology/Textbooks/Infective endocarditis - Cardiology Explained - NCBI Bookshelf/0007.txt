organisms – Haemophilus parainfluenza, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, the Eikenella species, and the Kingella species – also commonly cause IE and can be difficult to diagnose. Their identification may require samples to be taken in special media. IE is also caused by other, less common organisms. Candida, Aspergillus, Histoplasma, and Brucella infections are rare, but are found, in particular, in IVDAs, alcoholics, and patients with 3/7 prosthetic heart valves. Coxiella burnetii (the causative agent of Q fever) can also cause a subacute infection. Pathogenesis Endocarditis infection occurs along the edges of the heart valves. The lesions, called vegetations, are masses composed of fibrin, platelets, and infecting organisms, held together by agglutinating antibodies produced by the bacteria. As inflammation continues, ulceration may result in erosion or perforation of the valve cusps, leading to valvular incompetence, damage to the conduction pathway (if in the septal area), or rupture of a sinus of Valsalva (if in the aortic area). Although endocarditis can affect native and prosthetic valves, infection seldom affects a previously normal heart – the majority (60%) of IE patients have a predisposing cardiac condition. Vegetations usually affect the left side of the heart, with the most common underlying
