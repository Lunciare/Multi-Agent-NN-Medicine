The combination of profound caring, a prolific output of creative writing and ideas, and a lifelong penchant for elaborate practical jokes has made him one of the most memorable physicians of the 20th century. Staphylococci Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis account for 20%–30% of subacute cases of IE and 50% of the acute forms. The presence of central venous catheters (feeding lines or temporary pacing lines) increases susceptibility. Acute S. aureus infection of previously normal valves has a mortality rate of 3%. This is the most common situation in IVDAs. Coagulase- negative staphylococci cause 30%–50% of prosthetic valve endocarditis. Enterococci Enterococci account for 5%–15% of IE cases. Enterococcal organisms, which include Streptococcus faecalis, have low infectivity. HACEK organisms The HACEK group of organisms – Haemophilus parainfluenza, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, the Eikenella species, and the Kingella species – also commonly cause IE and can be difficult to diagnose.
