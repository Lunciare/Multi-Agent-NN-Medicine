Infective endocarditis - Cardiology Explained

found in coarctation usually occur distal to the obstruction. Finally, in children, cyanotic heart disease is still the most common cause of endocarditis, and the risk does not diminish after surgical repair as prostheses carry their own risk. Prosthetic valve endocarditis A special subset of endocarditis is that affecting prosthetic valves. This is traditionally divided into early onset (within 60 days of surgery) or late onset. Early onset usually results from perioperative valve contamination with staphylococci, whereas the etiology of late prosthetic valve endocarditis resembles native valve infection, usually due to streptococci. Refer with confidence As mentioned above, IE can be a difficult diagnosis to make, and the key for the generalist is to always be aware of it as a differential. Fever and arthralgia are very common complaints, but if there is any suggestion that they are not due to a simple viral illness (eg, by the presence of a particularly high temperature or other clinical signs [see above]) then the patient should be referred for blood cultures and an echo. If fever and a changing murmur coexist then urgent referral is warranted, although, even here, it can be useful to take blood cultures and a bottle for serology
