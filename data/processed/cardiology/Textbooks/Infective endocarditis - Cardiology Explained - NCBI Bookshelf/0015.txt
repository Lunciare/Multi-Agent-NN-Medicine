Infective endocarditis - Cardiology Explained

vegetation of >1 cm Surgery may involve not only valve replacement, but also aortic root replacement for aortic root abscesses. After the relevant surgical procedure, a full course of antibiotic eradication therapy should be administered. Prognosis 6/7 With effective treatment, patients with IE have a 70% survival rate. The prognosis is worse if there is no identifiable organism or if there is a resistant organism. Fungal infections are associated with increased mortality, as is prosthetic valve endocarditis. Overall death rates are 20% for native valve endocarditis, 30% for staphylococcal infections, and 20%–30% for late prosthetic valve infection, despite full medical and surgical treatment. The most common cause of death is intractable heart failure. Prophylaxis All patients at risk for IE should receive antibiotic cover for invasive procedures (see Tables 2 and 3, overleaf). Spontaneous bacteremia is also common as a result of poor dental hygiene, and susceptible patients need to be made aware of this.
