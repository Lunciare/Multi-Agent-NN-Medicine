12 hourly) for 2 weeks. If the onset is acute, staphylococci need to be covered and treatment should include IV cloxacillin (flucloxacillin) (3 g, 6 hourly, in place of penicillin) with oral fusidic acid. If the patient is allergic to penicillin, other possibilities are vancomycin (1 g twice daily) or teicoplanin (400 mg twice daily for 3 days, then 400 mg daily). Plasma levels of gentamicin and vancomycin need to be monitored every 48–72 hours. Empirical treatment of endocarditis affecting prosthetic valves should cover streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), and Gram-negative organisms. Vancomycin or teicoplanin with gentamicin have good synergistic cover. In drug abusers, treatment for endocarditis should include cover for S. aureus and Gram-negative bacilli (eg, cloxacillin and pipercillin). In the treatment of rarer causes of endocarditis, Coxiella may require doxycycline with cotrimoxazole or rifampicin. Candida and Aspergillus may respond to medical therapy (5- fluorouracil and amphotericin B, respectively), but, generally, all three of these infections respond poorly to medical therapy alone and require surgical intervention. In the treatment of IE, from any source, fever may still be present 2 weeks after starting the appropriate treatment, even with drug-sensitive organisms. This could be due to the presence
