Specialist management Investigations 4/7 Blood cultures Blood cultures are the primary investigation in the diagnosis of IE and yield the causative micro- organism in up to 95% of cases. A failure to do so can be due to prior antibiotic treatment, the presence of fastidious organisms (eg, belonging to the HACEK group), or unusual organisms such as Candida, Chlamydia, or Brucella. Most importantly, blood has to be drawn before antibiotic treatment is initiated, at three different time points over a minimum of 1 hour. At each time point, blood should be taken from a different site of the patient's body – but not from central lines – and each sample is placed into a pair of blood culture bottles that cultivate aerobic and anaerobic bacteria separately. If immediate antibiotic treatment is warranted, this can be initiated right after completion of blood culturing, once microbiology tests have identified a specific organism and the antibiotic therapy has been modified accordingly. Antibiotic therapy can have an
