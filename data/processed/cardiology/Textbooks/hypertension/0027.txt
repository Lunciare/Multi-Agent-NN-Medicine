system (RAS)-blocking agents. p. 20 Calcium channel blockers CCBs have very good BP-lowering and some anti-atherosclerotic effects. Its high potential for prevention of stroke and regression of LVH has been demonstrated. Some concerns have been raised regarding their effects in overt HF. Reduction in the risk of new-onset HF has been shown, compared to placebo, but to a lesser extent p. 21 compared to diuretics, ACEIs, or β-blockers. p. 22 Diuretics Hydrochlorothiazide, chlortalidone, and indapamide are the main representatives of this drug class. The advent of diuretics has been a cornerstone in antihypertensive therapy with a very long-standing tradition and a large body of evidence coming from RCTs. It is sensible to include diuretics, particularly in combination therapy regimens. Their main adverse effects are electrolyte imbalances (sodium, potassium). Some authors argue that diuretics and β-blockers may have some pro-diabetic properties, compared to ACEIs, ARBs, or CCBs. Special consideration should be given to spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, which is recommended as a third-line drug that is particularly effective in resistant hypertension, a condition often accompanied by aldosteronism. Beta-blockers By blocking the sympathetic actions on the heart and lowering renin secretion, β-blockers are effective BP- lowering agents. In a couple of studies,
