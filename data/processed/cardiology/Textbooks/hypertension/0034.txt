and DBP reduction of 4.4 and 3.6mmHg, respectively. Maintenance of a health body weight (BMI of about 25kg/m2) and waist circumference (<94cm for men and <80cm for women) is recommended for non-hypertensive individuals to prevent hypertension and for hypertensive patients to reduce BP. A multidisciplinary approach could be helpful. Physical exercise Studies indicated that physical activity was inversely related to mortality in hypertensive patients, meaning that patients with hypertension who were more active showed lower CV and all-cause mortality. A meta- analysis of RCTs showed that dynamic aerobic endurance, exercise resistance, and isometric training reduce SBP and DBP in the general population, but only endurance training reduces BP in hypertensive patients. Therefore, moderate-intensity dynamic aerobic exercise (walking, jogging, cycling, or swimming) is recommended for at least 30min 5–7 days/week. Additionally, resistance exercise can be advised two to three times per week. Smoking cessation Smoking triggers an acute increase in BP and heart rate, persisting for >15min after smoking a cigarette, through stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Smoking cessation is reported to be the single most effective lifestyle measure for prevention of a many CV diseases, including stroke and MI. Even in motivated patients, programmes to stop smoking after 1
