a reduction of 1.75g sodium/day (4.4g salt/day) was associated with a mean 4.2/2.1mmHg reduction in SBP/DBP, with a more pronounced effect (-5.4/-2.8mmHg) in people with hypertension. The effect of sodium restriction on BP was greater in blacks and older people, as well as in individuals with diabetes, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and CKD, i.e. groups that have a less responsive renin– angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS). To reduce salt intake, processed and oversalted food should be avoided; meals should be cooked from fresh ingredients, and salt could be substituted for herbs. As 80% of salt consumption involves hidden salt, it has been calculated that salt reduction in the manufacturing processes of bread, processed meat and cheese, margarine, and cereals will result in an increase in quality-adjusted life years. Moderation of alcohol consumption A linear relationship between alcohol consumption, BP levels, and the prevalence of hypertension has been demonstrated. Regular alcohol consumption raises BP, and increased alcohol intake attenuates the effects of antihypertensive drug therapy, which is mostly reversible within 1 or 2 weeks. Hypertensive men should be advised to limit their consumption of alcohol to 14 and women to 8 units per week (1 unit = 125ml of wine or 250ml of beer).
