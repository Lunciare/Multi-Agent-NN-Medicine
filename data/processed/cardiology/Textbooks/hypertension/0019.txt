by risk charts such as the SCORE risk charts. Nevertheless, initiation and escalation of treatment strategies require an individualized approach, which is facilitated by several algorithms from different cardiology societies. The ESC/ESH guidelines recommend therapy in the presence of an increased CV risk, which is calculated by BP levels and by adding information on concomitant risk factors, the presence of (sub)clinical target organ damage, and pre-existing established CV or kidney disease.2 Fig. 1.1.4 Initiation of antihypertensive therapy, depending on individualized cardiovascular risk.

According to the 2018 European guidelines, the goal of BP-lowering therapy is to achieve an SBP of 130– 139mmHg in almost all settings. It is recommended for patients at low to moderate CV risk (class I-B), diabetics (class I-A), patients with previous stroke/TIA (class IIa-B), and patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) (class IIa-B) or
