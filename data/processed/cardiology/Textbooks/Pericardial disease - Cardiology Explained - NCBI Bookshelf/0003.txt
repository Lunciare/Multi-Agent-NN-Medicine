Pericardial disease - Cardiology Explained

tests for immune markers, such as the antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), should be carried out in any patient with confirmed pericarditis. Acute and convalescent viral titers can also be requested, but rarely alter management. Management Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the treatment of choice for pericarditis. They relieve both the inflammatory process and the pain. Steroids may be required in serositic pericarditis, whereas pericarditis with a suspicious CXR and constitutional symptoms should prompt investigation for tuberculosis. Pericardial effusion and tamponade As with pleural effusion, the key defining presentation of pericardial effusion is the rate of fluid accumulation. Any cause of pericarditis can result in a significant accumulation of serous fluid, while hemopericardium (a collection of blood in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart) can be caused by trauma, type 1 dissection of the aorta, and cardiac rupture. The key feature is not the overall volume of fluid (even hundreds of milliliters can be asymptomatic if accumulated over a long enough time), but the rate of rise – as with pleural effusion, removal of even a small amount of fluid can result in significant benefit. Small, asymptomatic effusions can often be left to resorb on their own. This usually requires repeat echo
