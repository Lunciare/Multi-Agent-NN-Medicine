Chapter 13 Pericardial disease Pericarditis A diagnosis of pericarditis (inflammation of the pericardium), though rare, should always be considered as a differential for ischemic heart pain. The key differentiating features are that the pain in pericarditis is altered by posture and can be exacerbated by deep inspiration. Classically, the patient will be found sitting forward and taking shallow breaths. Pathophysiology The pericardium has two layers: visceral and parietal. The visceral layer is closely apposed to the heart, whilst the fibrous parietal layer provides a more rigid outer shell to the pericardial cavity (see Figure 1). The normal volume of pericardial fluid is in the region of 50 mL.
