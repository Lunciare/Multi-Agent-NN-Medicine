postmyocardial infarction (MI) or postcardiac surgery, which tends to be self-limiting. Relapsing episodes are referred to as Dressler's syndrome or postcardiotomy syndrome, and are thought to represent an autoimmune process. Table 1 Causes of pericarditis. Investigations Examination Auscultation may reveal a pericardial rub, which is sufficient, but not necessary, to make the diagnosis. It can easily be distinguished from a pleural rub by asking the patient to hold their breath. Electrocardiography The classic sign of pericarditis – a concave upwards ("saddle") ST-segment elevation throughout the 12 leads – is, of course, rare. However, some form of electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality is common. These changes are either present in all 12 leads or in leads that do not correspond to the territory perfused by a single coronary artery. Low voltages suggest the possibility of effusion. Chest x-ray A chest x-ray (CXR) can help to rule out a tuberculous cause of pericarditis and exclude significant effusion. Echocardiography Echocardiography is helpful mainly if there is a suspicion of effusion or tamponade. Blood tests Blood tests for immune markers, such as the antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), should be carried out in any patient with confirmed pericarditis. Acute and convalescent viral titers can also be requested,
