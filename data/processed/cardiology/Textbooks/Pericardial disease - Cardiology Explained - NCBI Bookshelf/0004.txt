removal of even a small amount of fluid can result in significant benefit. Small, asymptomatic effusions can often be left to resorb on their own. This usually requires repeat echo at regular intervals to ensure that resorption has occurred. Larger effusions bounded by the tough parietal pericardium can compromise the low pressure right heart – this results in tamponade (see Figure 2). Figure 2 An extreme form of pericardial effusion, known as a "swinging heart". The arrow indicates the effusion. Examination Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency. It is associated with a characteristic jugular venous pressure (JVP). Kussmaul's sign describes a raised JVP that rises further on inspiration, while Friedrich's sign describes a steep x/y descent (although, in reality at the bedside, the waves are hard to discern). The heart sounds are quiet and there may be a rub. Kussmaul's Legacy Adolph Kussmaul was Professor of Medicine successively at Heidelberg, Erlangen, Freiburg, and Strasbourg. As well as describing the paradoxical increase in JVP on inspiration in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, right ventricular failure, and constrictive pericarditis, he described the deep-sighing respiration associated with low arterial pH (Kussmaul breathing) and coined the term "polyarteritis nodosa". In fact, Kussmaul's JVP sign is
