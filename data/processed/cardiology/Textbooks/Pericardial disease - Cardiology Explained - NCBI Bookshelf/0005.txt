right ventricular failure, and constrictive pericarditis, he described the deep-sighing respiration associated with low arterial pH (Kussmaul breathing) and coined the term "polyarteritis nodosa". In fact, Kussmaul's JVP sign is widely misunderstood to be solely the result of right ventricular incompliance, when in fact the explanation relates as much to distension of the mesenteric vascular bed and the change from a right ventricular pressure that predominantly reflects 2/3 negative intrapleural pressure "sucking" blood into the chest, to one that predominantly reflects positive intra-abdominal pressure "pushing" the greater volume proximally. A characteristic of cardiac tamponade is pulsus paradoxus, which is not paradoxical at all, but an exaggeration of the normal drop in systolic pressure on inspiration –>10 mm Hg is abnormal. To test for it, inflate the cuff to just above systolic pressure then slowly deflate, stopping each 5 mm Hg for a full inspiration–expiration cycle. Listen for the point at which the beating becomes continuous throughout the breathing cycle. Electrocardiography Low-voltage ECG and beat-to-beat variation in R-wave amplitude are characteristic. Chest x-ray CXRs show a globular, "boot-shaped" heart. Echocardiography Echo is the investigation of choice. The key observation is diastolic collapse of the right atrium and ventricle. It demands urgent
