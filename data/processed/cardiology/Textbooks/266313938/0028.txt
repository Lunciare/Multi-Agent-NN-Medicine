The ESC Textbook of Preventive Cardiology

age 60 was proposed to stress that a high absolute risk would eventually occur if preventive action were not taken earlier. It was not intended that such young people should be necessarily treated as if they were 60—a literal interpretation of this concept could lead to excessive drug treatment in younger people. A relative risk chart has now been added to the absolute risk charts to illustrate, particularly in younger people, how lifestyle changes can substantially reduce risk as well as reducing the increasing risk that comes with with ageing. A new approach to this problem of lifetime risk in these guidelines is the concept of cardiovascular risk age (see the section ‘Cardiovascular risk age’). Age and gender There is another problem that concerns older and elderly people. In some age categories the majority, especially men, will have estimated cardiovascular death risks exceeding the 5% level based on age (and gender) only, even when other cardiovascular risk factor levels are relatively low. This could lead to excessive use of drugs in these age groups. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and newer risk factors The role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in risk estimation has been systematically re-examined using the SCORE database
