Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the biggest cause of death worldwide. The underlying atherosclerosis starts in childhood and is often advanced when it becomes clinically apparent many years later. CVD is manageable: in countries where it has reduced this is due to changes in lifestyle and risk factors and to therapy. Risk factor management reduces mortality and morbidity. In apparently healthy people CVD risk is most frequently the result of multiple interacting risk factors and a risk estimation system such as SCORE can assist in making logical management decisions. In younger people a low absolute risk may conceal a very high relative risk, and use of the relative risk chart or calculation of their ‘risk age’ may help in advising them of the need for intensive life style efforts. All risk estimation systems are relatively crude and require attention to qualifying statements.
