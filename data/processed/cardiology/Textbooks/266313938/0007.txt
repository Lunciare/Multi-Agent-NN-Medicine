major factors of age, gender, smoking, BP, and lipid levels. This term has become widely used; however, ‘total risk’ is not comprehensive because the effects of other risk factors are not considered, except as qualifying statements. The importance of total risk estimation before management decisions are made is illustrated in Table 5.1 and Fig. 5.1. Figure 5.1 shows that the effect of lipid levels on risk is modest in women who are at otherwise low risk, and that the risk advantage of being female is lost by the combination of smoking and mild hypertension. Table 5.1 shows that a person with a cholesterol concentration of 8 mmol/L can be at one-tenth of the risk of someone with a cholesterol concentration of 5 mmol/L if the latter is a hypertensive male smoker. While audits such as EUROASPIRE [5,6] suggest there is inadequate management of risk factors in very high-risk subjects, it is also likely that, in the context of low-risk subjects who have not had a vascular event, there is the potential for substantial overuse of drugs by inappropriate extrapolation of the results of trials conducted mostly in high-risk men to low-risk individuals. In general, women and old and young subjects
