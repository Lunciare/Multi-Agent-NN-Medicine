less severe hypertrophy develop arrhythmias, increased ventricular stiffness, heart failure, or sudden death. Indeed, there can be considerable variation in phenotype within families (see Figure 2). 182 Cardiomyopathy This much variation can exist in one family N HCM LVmass Figure 2.Left ventricular (LV) mass in a normal (N) individual and in a patient with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Clinical examination HCM has classic clinical signs, most of which relate to outflow obstruction (hence their presence is not required for diagnosis). They are as follows: • jerky pulse • prominent “a” wave in jugular venous pressure (JVP) • double apex beat • S3 • S4 • late ejection quality systolic murmur over the aortic area that is increased by standing and decreased by squatting • a pansystolic murmur at the apex (indicating mitral regurgitation [MR]) The ECG may show LVH and T-wave inversion. With progressive left ventricular disease, left bundle branch block (LBBB) may appear. Echo is the test of choice. Left ventricular wall thickness is measured from M-mode traces (see Chapter 4, Understanding the echocardiogram). Left ventricular outflow tract velocities can be measured and pressure drop estimated by continuous-wave Doppler. Diastolic dysfunction is common in HCM. Specialist management Medical The main
