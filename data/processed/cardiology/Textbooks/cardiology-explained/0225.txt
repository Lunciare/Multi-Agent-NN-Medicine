regurgitation An early diastolic murmur is always justification for referral to a cardiologist for assessment and echo. Causes • Rheumatic involvement of the aortic valve, resulting in thickening of the cusps and fusion of the commissures – the valve neither opens nor closes completely. • Dilatation of the aortic root resulting from aneurysm of the ascending aorta – this is commonly seen in Marfan’s syndrome. 150 Valve disease • Dilatation of the aortic annulus can also result from connective tissue disease, such as ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Reiter’s syndrome, relapsing polychondritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus. • Dissecting aneurysm involving the aortic root. • Syphilitic aortitis causing aortic aneurysm and dilatation of the valve ring that may involve the coronary ostia. Table 2outlines the causes of aortic regurgitation. Natural history and therapeutic options Chronic AR represents a condition of combined volume and pressure overload on the LV. The ejection fraction (EF) – the percentage of the end diastolic volume ejected during systole – is maintained by compensatory LVH and the majority of patients remain in this compensated phase for decades. However, in time, the EF drops. Although initially this is fully reversible, soon, due to progressive dilatation and remodeling, full recovery
