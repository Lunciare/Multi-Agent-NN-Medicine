sodium concentration is often low (<130 mmol/L, despite high total body sodium) as a result of dilution and is a strong prognostic indicator. The potassium level is altered by many of the therapeutic agents and should be kept in the mid to high normal range (4.25–5 mmol/L) to minimize the risk of arrhythmia. If the pulse is of full volume, investigative blood tests for anemia and thyroid function should be carried out. If echo suggests restrictive cardiomyopathy, further tests can be carried out for iron storage disease, amyloidosis, or sarcoidosis. 97 Chapter 7 Figure 4.Cardiomegaly and pleural effusion (on the right side) in a patient with heart failure. Management: acute heart failure The approach to the management of acute decompensation is different from that to CHF. Acute pulmonary edema should be managed by: • sitting the patient up • giving high-flow oxygen • giving diamorphine (2.5–5 mg intravenous [IV]) • giving nitrates (sublingual at first, then isosorbide mononitrate 2–10mg/hour IV) • giving loop diuretics (eg, furosemide [frusemide] 40–80 mg slow IV) Blood pressure is a key measurement and should be considered when deciding the rate of a nitrate infusion or whether to use b-agonists. If the systolic blood pressure drops
