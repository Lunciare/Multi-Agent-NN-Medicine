TNF: tumor necrosis factor. Pathophysiology The approach to heart failure has changed enormously over the past few years (see Figure 1). Earlier thinking focused on inadequate pump function and the accepted therapeutic wisdom was to bolster it with b-agonist inotropes. The idea of treating heart failure by blocking the sympathetic nervous system would have been regarded as heretical and dangerous. However, it has now been realized that most CHF pathology is a result of the body’s
