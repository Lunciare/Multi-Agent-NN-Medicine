and arterioles. The prognosis is very 90 Hypertension poor: untreated, 90% of patients die within 1 year, and even with treatment the 5-year survival rate is only 60%. Malignant hypertension is a medical emergency that requires immediate therapy. However, the fall in BP should be controlled and carefully monitored as cerebral and myocardial perfusion can become compromised, which could lead to infarction (an initial target diastolic BP should be around 100–110 mm Hg). The reduction in BP is achieved with parenteral agents, such as nitroprusside or labetalol, ideally with intra-arterial BP monitoring. If a pheochromocytoma is suspected, drugs such as phenoxybenzamine or phentolamine (a-adrenergic blockers) should be used first. Once the acute episode has been successfully treated, the BP can be further titrated down over the following weeks. Further reading Graves, JW. Management of difficult-to-control hypertension.
