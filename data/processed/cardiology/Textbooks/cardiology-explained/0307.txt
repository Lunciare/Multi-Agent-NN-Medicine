the balloon catheter is pulled back forcefully into the right atrium, creating a tear in the septum. This procedure is usually effective in the neonatal period and allows the child to live until the latter part of the first year of life, when the Mustard operation can be performed. This involves rerouting venous return by inserting an intra-atrial baffle. The definitive treatment is the arterial switch operation, in which the arteries are switched back to their appropriate ventricles. The biggest challenge with this procedure is reattaching the coronary arteries, the anatomical organization of which is variable in TGA. In addition, the “low pressure” LV must take on filling of the systemic circulation. Ebstein’s anomaly Ebstein’s anomaly is the downward displacement of a portion of the tricuspid valve with atrialization of a large part of the RV (see Figure 12). There is often an associated ostium secundum ASD. The atrialized portion of the ventricle hinders rather than helps the forward flow of blood and there is tricuspid regurgitation. Occasionally Ebstein’s anomaly is asymptomatic, but it generally presents in childhood or early adulthood with dyspnea, fatigue, signs of tricuspid regurgitation, and right-sided cardiac failure. Patients with Ebstein’s anomaly require prophylaxis for endocarditis.
