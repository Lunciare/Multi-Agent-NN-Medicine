nonsterile injection into the venous system. The presentation tends to differ from that of classic IE, in that these patients are more likely to develop pneumonia or septic pulmonary emboli than the characteristic signs mentioned above (which result from left-sided embolization). In addition, predominant right-sided failure is more common (look for significantly raised jugular venous pressure and gross peripheral edema). The tricuspid valve is most commonly affected (50%), whereas involvement of the mitral and aortic valves is less common (20% each). The involvement of multiple valves is common. Pulmonary valve endocarditis is rare. Etiology IE has a large number of causative organisms. Streptococci These account for 50%–80% of IE cases. Streptococcus viridans (eg, S. anguis, S. milleri, S. mutans, S. mitior) make up the normal bacterial flora of the pharynx and upper respiratory tract. Tonsillectomy, dental extraction, and dental cleaning can result in bacteremia and lead to infection. 169 Chapter 10 The Duke criteria for the diagnosis of IE Major criteria 1. Positive blood culture for IE A. Typical micro-organism consistent with IE from two separate blood cultures, as noted below: • viridans streptococci, Streptococcus bovisa, or HACEK group; or • community-acquired Staphylococcus aureusor enterococci, in the absence of a
