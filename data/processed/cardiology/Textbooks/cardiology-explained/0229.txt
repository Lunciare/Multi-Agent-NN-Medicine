leaflet (see Figure 2). The normal area of the MV orifice is 4–5 cm2. Symptoms of mitral stenosis (MS) develop when the orifice is <2.5 cm2and a critical stenosis occurs when it is approximately 1 cm2 (seeFigure 3). The signs and causes of MS are outlined in Table 3. Causes Rheumatic heart disease is the most common cause of MS, although it pre-dates the symptoms by at least 10 years. Other acquired causes are rare – eg, annular calcification, endocarditis, or granulomatous infiltration in association with eosinophilia. 152 Valve disease Anterior leaflet Anteromedial commissure Anterior annulus Posterior leaflet Posterolateral (three lobes) commissure Posterior Chordae tendineae annulus Lateral papillary Medial papillary muscle muscle Figure 1.The structure of the mitral valve apparatus. Figure 2.A calcified mitral valve posterior leaflet in diastole. Signs Symptoms of MS generally occur during exertion, infection, stress, or with the onset of atrial fibrillation (AF) with a rapid ventricular response. This is because a left atrial (LA) pressure that is normal at rest rises with an increase in transmitral flow or a decrease in the diastolic filling time. The most common manifestation is breathlessness, but a reduction in exercise tolerance or symptoms of right-sided congestion can also occur.
