consistent with IE from two separate blood cultures, as noted below: • viridans streptococci, Streptococcus bovisa, or HACEK group; or • community-acquired Staphylococcus aureusor enterococci, in the absence of a primary focus; or B. Micro-organisms consistent with IE from persistently positive blood cultures defined as: • two or more positive cultures of blood samples drawn >12 hours apart • all of three or a majority of four or more separate cultures of blood (with first and last sample drawn ≥1 hour apart) 2. Evidence of endocardial involvement A. Positive echocardiogram for IE defined as: • oscillating intracardiac mass on valve or supporting structures, in the path of regurgitant jets, or on implanted material in the absence of an alternative anatomic explanation; or • abscess; or • new partial dehiscence of prosthetic valve; or B. New valvular regurgitation (worsening or changing of pre-existing murmur not sufficient) Minor criteria 1. Predisposition: predisposing heart condition or intravenous drug use 2. Fever: temperature ≥38.0ºC 3. Vascular phenomena: major arterial emboli, septic pulmonary infarcts, mycotic aneurysm, intracranial hemorrhage, conjunctival hemorrhages, and Janeway lesions 4. Immunologic phenomena: glomerulonephritis, Osler’s nodes, Roth spots, and rheumatoid factor 5. Microbiological evidence: positive blood culture, but does not meet a
