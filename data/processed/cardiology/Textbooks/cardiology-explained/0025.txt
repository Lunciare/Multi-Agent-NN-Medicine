normal ECG. ST segment The ST segment, which is also known as the ST interval, is the time between the end of the QRS complex and the start of the T wave. It reflects the period of zero potential between ventricular depolarization and repolarization. T wave T waves represent ventricular repolarization (atrial repolarization is obscured by the large QRS complex). Wave direction and size Since the direction of a deflection, upward or downward, is dependent on whether the electrical activity is going towards or away from a lead, it differs according to the orientation of the lead with respect to the heart (see Figure 5). The ECG trace reflects the net electrical activity at a given moment. Consequently, activity in one direction is masked if there is more activity, eg, by a larger mass, in the other direction. For example, the left ventricle muscle mass is much greater than the right, and therefore its depolarization accounts for the direction of the biggest wave. Interpreting the ECG A normal ECG tracing is provided in Figure 6. The only way to become confident at reading ECGs is to practice. It is important to be methodical – every ECG reading should start with
