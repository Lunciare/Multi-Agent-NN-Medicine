population could be explained by genetic factors. The experimental approach has involved studying affected sibling pairs and scanning the whole genome for chromosomal regions with higher levels of genetic marker similarity. Selectively bred animal models have also been used to study hypertension. Despite much effort, the only mutations that have been convincingly shown to be associated with hypertension are those of the ACEgene, and these gene polymorphisms are more strongly associated with atherosclerotic disease than hypertension. The role of the sympathetic nervous system in hypertension has been debated over many years. Most agree that, together with inadequate salt excretion, it plays an important initiating role (validating the choice of β-blockers as a first-line agent in young hypertensives). However, there is significant controversy as to its continuing role. The prevalent view is that the sympathetic nervous system plays only a minor part in chronic hypertension, and recent studies showing the benefit of ARBs over β-blockers reinforce this. Resistant hypertension Failure to reduce BP to <140/90 mm Hg with three or more drugs qualifies the patient as “resistant”. Resistant hypertensives commonly suffer plasma volume expansion, despite the absence of clinical signs. In this situation, a more aggressive diuretic therapy can achieve targets
