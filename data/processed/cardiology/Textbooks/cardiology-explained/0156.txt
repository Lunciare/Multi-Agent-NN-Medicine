However, the advent of ARBs is likely to offer a better alternative to ACEIs than this drug combination. 105 Chapter 7 NYHA Affect outcome Symptom class control only ACEI BB Spironolactone ARB Hydralazine/ Digoxin Diuretic nitrates I + +/– – – + – + II + + – + + – + III + + + + + + + IV + + + + + + + Table 7.Treatment of heart failure according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of congestive heart failure. ACEI: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB: angiotensin receptor blocker; BB: b-blocker. Future directions Areas of controversy still exist in the management of CHF. For example, aspirin is known to be effective as an aid to secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. However, it can reduce the efficacy of ACEIs. Also, despite the high rate of heart failure deaths due to arrhythmia (50%), amiodarone is the only antiarrhythmic (so far) that has been shown to reduce mortality. New agents currently being investigated in trials include: • calcium sensitizers (increase contractile response to intracellular Ca2+) • endothelin antagonists (there are
