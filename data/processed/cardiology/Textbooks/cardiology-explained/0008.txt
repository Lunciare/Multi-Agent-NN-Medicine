the exact height of the JVP is a poor guide to central venous pressure. Taken together, this suggests that noting whether the JVP is “up” or “down” is good practice in every cardiac patient. In particular, it can be very useful in diagnosing right-sided heart failure and in differentiating a cardiovascular cause of acute shortness of breath (right ventricular failure, pulmonary embolism) from an intrinsic pulmonary cause (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). For the general physician, the waveform of the JVP (see Figure 1) is, for most purposes, only of academic significance. 7 Chapter 2 a a v c y x Diastole Ventricular Diastole systole a wave x descent v wave y descent Atrium contracting Atrium relaxing then Atrium tense, full; Atrium emptying, tricuspid valve open filling, tricuspid tricuspid closed tricuspid open closed Figure 1.Waveforms of the jugular venous pressure (including a brief explanation for each wave). The “c” wave represents right ventricular contraction “pushing” the tricuspid valve back into the right atrium. Reproduced with permission from Oxford University Press (Longmore JM et al.
