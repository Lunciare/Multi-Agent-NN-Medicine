it may be normal or show conduction disturbances. Chest x-ray shows increased cardiothoracic ratio and pulmonary vascular congestion. Echo is the test of choice and will show a grossly dilated ventricle with thin walls and globally impaired systolic function. Disease progression results in functional MR and the development of left atrial dilatation. In rare cases, the disease solely affects the right heart. Cardiac catheterization is used to exclude coronary artery disease and measure intracardiac pressures. Management Management is as described for chronic heart failure (see Chapter 7, Heart failure). Restrictive cardiomyopathy Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle that results in myocardial stiffness and an incompliant ventricle. Patients present with predominantly right-sided failure (gross peripheral edema, raised JVP, hepatomegaly) and a normal-sized heart. Classic clinical signs are rapid x and y descent of the JVP, and loud S3 and S4. The most common causes are: • hemochromatosis • sarcoidosis • amyloidosis • carcinoid syndrome • glycogen storage disease • scleroderma • endomyocardial fibrosis and eosinophilic heart disease Investigations The ECG can be a useful tool, as subendocardial fibrosis can result in conduction disturbances. In addition, amyloid heart disease presents with low voltages. However, echo enables diagnosis. Classic findings
