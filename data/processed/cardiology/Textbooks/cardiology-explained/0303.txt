Aorta Figure 7. Coarctation of the aorta. Bicuspid aortic valve Bicuspid aortic valves often function normally throughout most of a patient’s life. However, fibrosis and calcification ultimately lead to aortic stenosis (see Chapter 9, Valve disease) and an eventual requirement for surgical correction. Coarctation of the aorta Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the lumen, usually just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery (see Figure 7). Most commonly, the patient presents in their twenties or thirties, usually with hypertension. Without surgery, 50% die before the age of 30 years. Potential treatments include resection of the narrowed segment with end-to-end anastomosis, repair involving the subclavian artery, and balloon angioplasty – the role of which remains controversial. Hypertension, which is often the presenting feature, must be aggressively treated both before and after surgery (it commonly persists). Pulmonary valve stenosis Patients with mild to moderate pulmonary stenosis usually remain asymptomatic until the onset of atrial flutter/fibrillation or right heart failure, which lead to breathlessness, ascites, peripheral edema, and a visit to the doctor. Fatigue, slight dyspnea, and effort syncope occur with severe narrowing. The physical signs depend on the severity of the obstruction and secondary effects on RV
