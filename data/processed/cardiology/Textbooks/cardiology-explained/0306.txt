RV infundibulum and VSD closure with incorporation of the aorta into the RV. Adult Fallot’s patients often suffer impaired exercise capacity due to poor RV function. Transposition of the great arteries In transposition of the great arteries (TGA), the RV connects to the aorta and the LV connects to the pulmonary artery (see Figure 10). The result, following peripartum closure of the foramen ovale, is two parallel circulations – a physiology that is not compatible with life. The neonate would die instantly were it not for the common coexistence of a patent foramen ovale, ASD, VSD, or PDA. In infants, an 210 Adult congenital heart disease Aorta PDA Pulmonary artery Right ventricle Left ventricle Figure 8. Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). improvement in symptoms can be achieved by creating a large defect in the atrial septum to allow mixing of the blood between systemic and pulmonary circulations (Rashkind’s procedure – see Figure 11). This is performed by passing a balloon catheter into the left atrium via the right atrium. After inflation, the balloon catheter is pulled back forcefully into the right atrium, creating a tear in the septum. This procedure is usually effective in the neonatal period and allows the child
