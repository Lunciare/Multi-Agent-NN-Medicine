Constitutional symptoms Endocarditis should be considered in patients with vague or generalized constitutional symptoms such as fever, rigors, night sweats, anorexia, weight loss, or arthralgia. Cardiac signs The presence of a new murmur is very significant, as is a change in the nature of an existing murmur (a regurgitant murmur may disappear on worsening). Myocardial involvement or valvular dysfunction may both contribute to left ventricular failure. Skin lesions Endocarditis is indicated by: • Osler’s nodes – tender lesions found on finger pulps and thenar/hypothenar eminences (see Figure 1) • Janeway lesions – transient, nontender macular papules on palms or soles • splinter hemorrhages • petechiae (embolic or vasculitic) • clubbing – in long-standing disease 167 Chapter 10 Figure 1.Osler’s nodes on a finger and foot. Eyes Roth spots (boat-shaped hemorrhages with pale centers, in retina) and conjunctival splinter hemorrhages may be found. Splenomegaly Splenic infarction may occur as a result of emboli. In this case, splenic palpation may be painful and tender, and a rub may be heard. Neurological An acute confusional state is common in
