Cardiology

an asymptomatic mid systolic murmur, a negative history and a negative physical exam are sufficient to exclude sinister pathology in most cases. Grade Murmur I Just audible in a quiet room II Quiet III Loud, no thrill IV Loud, with thrill V Very loud with thrill VI Audible without a stethoscope Table 1.Grading of murmurs. 145 Chapter 9 In the elderly, it is important to differentiate between the common and benign aortic sclerosis and the less common and less benign aortic stenosis (AS). As such, close attention should be paid to the cardiac exam. In particular, AS is indicated by: • murmur radiation • the presence of a thrill • a soft second heart sound In addition, an electrocardiogram should be carried out to screen for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), ischemia, and atrial size or conduction abnormalities. If none of the above is present and the patient remains asymptomatic, the most likely diagnosis is aortic sclerosis and no echo is required. Referral is warranted when a murmur in an asymptomatic patient is: • systolic and grade III or above • late systolic • mid systolic and accompanied by clinical signs suggestive of AS • diastolic • continuous Aortic stenosis Causes
