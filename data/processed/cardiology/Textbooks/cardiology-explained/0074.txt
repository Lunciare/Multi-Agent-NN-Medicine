the development of atherosclerosis and CAD. VLDLs and LDLs are atherogenic lipoproteins, whereas HDL concentrations are inversely related to the incidence of CAD.

BA: bile acid; Chol: cholesterol; Chylo: chylomicron; Chylo rem: chylomicronremnant; FA: fatty acid; HDL: high-density lipoprotein; HMG-CoA: hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; LDL: low-density lipoprotein; LPL: lipoprotein lipase; TG: triglyceride; VLDL: very low-density lipoprotein. treatments for hyperlipidemia aim to reduce LDL levels and raise HDL levels. Pharmacotherapeutic options in hyperlipidemia include: • statins, which inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA), the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis in the liver. A reduction in cholesterol synthesis causes the liver to increase the number of LDL receptors, reducing circulating concentrations of both cholesterol and triglyceride • cholestyramine, which is a lipid-lowering drug that acts by sequestering bile acids in the gut, thus increasing the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol • fibrates, which reduce the level of VLDL by increasing the activity
