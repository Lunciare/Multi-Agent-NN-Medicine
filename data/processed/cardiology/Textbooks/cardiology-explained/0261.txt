group), or unusual organisms such as Candida, Chlamydia, or Brucella. Most importantly, blood has to be drawn before antibiotic treatment is initiated, at three different time points over a minimum of 1 hour. At each time point, blood should be taken from a different site of the patient’s body – but not from central lines – and each sample is placed into a pair of blood culture bottles that cultivate aerobic and anaerobic bacteria separately. If immediate antibiotic treatment is warranted, this can be initiated right after completion of blood culturing, once microbiology tests have identified a specific organism and the antibiotic therapy has been modified accordingly. Antibiotic therapy can have an enormous impact on the patient’s prognosis; therefore, all efforts have to be made to collect and culture specimens as carefully as possible. This ensures the correct identification of the causative micro-organisms, and ultimately the correct use of antibiotics. 173 Chapter 10 Figure 3.Transesophageal echo for 1 mm lesions.

Chamber size, pre-existing rheumatic disease, and valve apparatus can be examined and the degree of valve incompetence assessed. Transthoracic two-dimensional echo can
