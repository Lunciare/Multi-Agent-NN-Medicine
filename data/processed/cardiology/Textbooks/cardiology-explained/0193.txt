Cardiology

Another choice for patients with heart failure or hypertension associated with AF is flecainide (in the absence of coronary artery disease) or amiodarone (if coronary artery disease is present). If, several days following chronic treatment, patients remain in AF, there are two avenues of management: accept progression to permanent AF (and attend to rate control and anticoagulation) or attempt cardioversion. 131 Chapter 8 Newly discovered AF Paroxysmal Persistent No therapy needed unless severe symptoms (eg, Rate control and hypotension, HF, Accept anticoagulation angina pectoris) permanent AF as needed Rate control and Consider Anticoagulation anticoagulation antiarrhythmic as needed as needed drug therapy Cardioversion Long-term antiarrhythmic drug therapy unnecessary Figure 19.Pharmacological management of patients with newly discovered atrial fibrillation (AF).
