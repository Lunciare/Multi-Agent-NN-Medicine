Cardiology

the changes resulting from pregnancy greatly increase risk and most cardiologists would counsel against pregnancy. The following are also associated with increased risk, either to the mother or fetus: • severe AS • MR/AR with class III–IV symptoms • MS with class II–IV symptoms • pulmonary pressures >75% of systemic • EF <40% • mechanical prosthetic valves requiring anticoagulation • AR in Marfan’s syndrome 163 Chapter 9 Although risk is increased, many patients with valvular abnormalities can be managed through pregnancy with conservative medical measures aimed at optimizing intravascular volume. Mitral stenosis Penicillin prophylaxis should be continued in pregnant women with MS. The cautious use of diuretics and b-blockers in those with mild to moderate disease can prevent tachycardia and optimize diastolic filling. For women with severe disease, a percutaneous balloon valvotomy prior to conception should be considered. Those who develop class III–IV symptoms during pregnancy should also undergo valvotomy. This can be achieved with very limited fluoroscopy or appropriate shielding. Mitral regurgitation The usual cause of MR is MVP; this rarely requires treatment. Aortic stenosis The most likely cause of AS in a woman of childbearing age is congenital bicuspid disease. Mild to moderate obstruction can be managed conservatively
