a conduit. It is disconnected at its distal end only and the cut end is connected to the LAD. In the same way, the right internal mammary artery (RIMA) can be connected to the RCA. A clear benefit of LIMA/RIMA CABG is improved graft patency, both perioperatively and in the long term (10years). Other arteries that can be used include the radial and the gastroepiploic. Due to the risks of heart–lung bypass – such as postbypass cognitive deficit – some centers now practice beating heart surgery. In this procedure the heart is not arrested: the section of the heart that is to be operated on is stabilized locally by the “suckers” (vacuum-operated suction clamps) of a device known as an octopus. Another technique is minimally invasive bypass, which uses small incisions and LIMA grafts. 66 Coronary artery disease Left internal mammary graft Left main stem Saphenous Circumflex artery vein graft Left anterior descending artery Conus Septal branch SA nodal branch Diagonal branch Right Obtuse marginal coronary branch artery Septal branch Right posterolateral branch Marginal branch Posterior descending artery Figure 9.Sites of heart bypass grafting: a saphenous vein graft and a left internal mammary artery graft are shown.
