were subject to episodes of paroxysmal tachycardia. The relative contributions of the authors are uncertain. Wolff (1898–1972) and White (1886–1973) were both US cardiologists, while Parkinson (1885–1976) was an English physician: one patient had been seen at the London Hospital, while most of the others were examined in Boston. White was a giant of cardiology – he studied the ECG with Thomas Lewis and was a strong advocate of heart disease prevention through exercise, especially bicycle exercise. A bike path in Boston is named after him. 127 Chapter 8 Figure 16.Electrocardiogram of ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia In the acute situation, broad complex tachycardias present a diagnostic challenge because SVT with aberrant conduction can be difficult to distinguish from VT. As mentioned previously, the key question remains – is the patient compromised? Certain features on the ECG can help to distinguish VT from SVT (see Figure 16): • a very broad QRS complex (>0.14seconds) • AV dissociation (but Pwaves are often difficult to distinguish in broad complex tachycardias) • concordance (all QRS complexes in V1–V6 are either positive or negative) • fusion beats • capture beats However, the key test is an adenosine challenge, which will interrupt an SVT but have
