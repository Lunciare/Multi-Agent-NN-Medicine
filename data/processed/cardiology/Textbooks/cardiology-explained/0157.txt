far) that has been shown to reduce mortality. New agents currently being investigated in trials include: • calcium sensitizers (increase contractile response to intracellular Ca2+) • endothelin antagonists (there are increased levels of endothelin – a potent vasoconstrictor – in heart failure); results of all recent trials have been negative or neutral at best • TNF-aantibodies; recent trials all produced negative results • neutral endopeptidase inhibitors (neutral endopeptidase breaks down atrial natriuretic peptide and brain natriuretic peptide – peptides with diuretic, natriuretic, and vasodilator properties) Heart failure treatments, according to NYHA classification, are outlined in Table 7. Nonpharmacotherapies Recent evidence suggests that individualized exercise training programs can be beneficial in stable, mild to moderate heart failure. Like most other aspects of the treatment of heart failure, today’s advice (exercise) is the opposite of that from 30years ago (bed rest). 106 Heart failure EARLY TREATMENTS The first breakthrough in the treatment of heart failure was by William Withering (1741–1799), who published observations of the therapeutic use of digitalis (foxglove). Ironically, he believed its main mechanism of action was diuretic. Until the discovery of digitalis, treatment for heart failure had remained unchanged since Egyptian times: bed rest, fluid restriction, and weak herbal
