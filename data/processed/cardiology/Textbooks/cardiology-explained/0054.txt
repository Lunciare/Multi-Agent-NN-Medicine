ideas were radical and new and (not surprisingly) no one believed him. 45 Chapter 5 Stable Unstable Ruptured Abundant Thick fibrous Abundant Thin fibrous smooth cap macrophages cap Fibrin muscle cells and lipid rich WBC RBC Platelet Rupture Figure 1.An atherosclerotic plaque consists of a core of dead foam cells (lipid-engorged macrophages and smooth muscle cells) covered by a fibrous cap (a region of the intimal layer that has become thickened as a result of medial smooth muscle cells depositing collagen and elastin fibers). The thickening artery wall of an atherosclerotic plaque gradually encroaches upon the luminal space and can eventually result in a restriction to blood flow. Unstable plaques, which are susceptible to rupture, are softer with a thinner fibrous cap. Plaque rupture triggers the formation of a blood clot, which can block the flow of blood through the artery. RBC: red blood cell; WBC: white blood cell. Presentation Vascular event Stable angina No plaque rupture, but symptomatic or limiting stable occlusion Acute coronary syndromes Plaque rupture with transient (unstable angina/non-Q wave MI) or incomplete occlusion MI Plaque rupture with complete occlusion and tissue necrosis Table 1.Subgroups of coronary artery disease presentations. MI: myocardial infarction. The establishment of these
