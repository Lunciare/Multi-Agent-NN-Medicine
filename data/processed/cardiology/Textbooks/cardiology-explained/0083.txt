a higher resolution from a lower dose of radiation. Single photon emission CT (SPECT) is a technique that employs a gamma camera head that rotates around the patient to provide three-dimensional images. Isotopes are also used in ventriculography. Estimates of LV function arrived at using this imaging technique are more accurate and reproducible than those resulting from echo. Consequently, ventriculography is indicated in: 60 Coronary artery disease Suspicion of coronary disease Preprobability Low Intermediate High Exercise treadmill test and diagnostic/prognostic score Stress echo Cardiac Scintigraphy catheterization MRI Figure 7.Diagnostic algorithm for coronary artery disease.

The former, which is more common, uses a sample of the patient’s blood labeled with Tc-99m. Information is gathered from each heartbeat over the time of equilibration (a few minutes) then averaged to give the final reading. In the first-pass technique, a bolus of radionuclide is injected and information is gathered over a much shorter time with a fast gamma camera. Stress echocardiography Stress echo is gaining in popularity because it has: • a higher predictive value than
