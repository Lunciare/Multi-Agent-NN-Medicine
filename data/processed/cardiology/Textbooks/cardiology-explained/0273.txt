4, Understanding the echocardiogram). Left ventricular outflow tract velocities can be measured and pressure drop estimated by continuous-wave Doppler. Diastolic dysfunction is common in HCM. Specialist management Medical The main aim of medical treatment is to limit the effects of outflow tract obstruction. Beta-blockers and/or rate limiting calcium-channel blockers, such as verapamil, can improve diastolic filling (by reducing heart rate), reduce exercise- related outflow obstruction, and reduce the possibility of arrhythmia. Amiodarone 183 Chapter 11 and sotalol can prevent supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmia, but should only be used in patients with a previous episode. Dual-chamber pacing Patients who remain symptomatic despite drug therapy can have a DDD pacemaker inserted (see Chapter 8, Arrhythmia), set to a short atrioventricular (AV) delay. The effect of this is to pace the right ventricle each beat and induce an LBBB- type activation of the left ventricle, which reduces outflow obstruction by desynchronizing contraction of the septum and the posterior wall. Patients can be treadmill-tested to confirm that the AV delay is sufficiently short to maintain right ventricle capture at higher heart rates. Nonsurgical septal reduction A recent technique involving cardiac catheterization has been proposed as an alternative for outflow tract pressure gradient reduction and
