after calculating rate, rhythm, and axis – check the width of the QRS complex. If it is more than three small squares wide, it is abnormal. Bundle branch block can then be diagnosed by pattern recognition of the QRS complexes in the V1 and V6 leads (see Figure 14). New LBBB can be diagnostic of myocardial infarction (MI). 27 Chapter 3 aVR V1 V4 I aVL V2 V5 II aVF V3 V6 III V1 II Figure 16.ECG demonstrating ST-segment depression (I, V3–V6). aVR V1 V4 I aVL V2 V5 II aVF V3 V6 III V1 II Figure 17.ECG demonstrating T-wave inversion. ST segment changes The ST segment extends from the end of the S wave to the start of the T wave. It should be flat or slightly upsloping and level with the baseline. Elevation of more than two small squares in the chest leads or one small square in the limb leads, combined with a characteristic history, indicates the possibility of MI (see Figure15, previous page). ST depression is diagnostic of ischemia (see Figure16). It is worth noting that although ST elevation can localize the lesion (eg, anterior MI, 28 Conquering the ECG aVR V1 V4 I aVL V2
