ST depression), most commonly in the lateral chest leads. Arrhythmias are also common in heart failure. Chest x-ray Classic signs on CXRs are common only for acute heart failure. Typically, some of the following signs are seen (see Figure 3): • cardiomegaly (see Figure 4) • upper lobe blood diversion • “bat’s wing” alveolar edema • pleural effusions • Kerley B lines (lymphatics) 96 Heart failure (a) Prominent upper lobe Alveolar vessels edema (“bat’s wing”) Kerley B lines (interstitial edema) Pleural effusion Cardiomegaly (b) Figure 3.(a) Classic signs of acute heart failure that can be seen on a chest x-ray of left ventricular failure.

Echocardiography This is the investigation of choice and can identify and quantify LVH and dysfunction (both systolic and diastolic) as well as examine causes of heart failure, such as valve abnormalities. Blood tests The measurement of natriuretic peptides for the diagnosis of heart failure is not yet routine. However, other blood tests can contribute to the clinical picture. The sodium concentration is often low (<130 mmol/L, despite high total body sodium) as a result of dilution and is a strong prognostic indicator. The potassium level is altered by many
