plaque, but this has not yet been found. Magnetic resonance imaging Most cardiologists agree that the future of noninvasive imaging of the heart lies with MRI. This technology can fulfill many of the functions of traditional tests and in most cases improve on them: • cardiac anatomy and morphology can be assessed with a high degree of spatial resolution using “black-blood” imaging • in cine mode (like two-dimensional echo), resolutions can be achieved that are significantly greater than those obtained with ultrasound and good views can be imaged and processed in under 30seconds • LV function – including under exercise/pharmacological stress – can be achieved with a single breath-hold and the circumferential shortening calculated 62 Coronary artery disease • wall-motion abnormalities can be assessed using tagging techniques • perfusion imaging can be carried out with a single breath-hold and two R–R intervals In fact, the only technique that is still some way from routine clinical application is magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the coronary vessels (larger vessel MRA has been possible for some time). However, as new technology moves the field forward, this is likely to become more attainable, and with it the tempting prospect of cross-sectional imaging and plaque
