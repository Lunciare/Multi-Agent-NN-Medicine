patient is: • systolic and grade III or above • late systolic • mid systolic and accompanied by clinical signs suggestive of AS • diastolic • continuous Aortic stenosis Causes Congenital aortic stenosis Congenital AS is usually due to a bicuspid valve. A bicuspid valve in itself does not give rise to significant hemodynamic abnormality, but it has a tendency to calcify and a predisposition to infective endocarditis (see Table 2). Rheumatic aortic stenosis Rheumatic AS results from cusp fusion and calcification many years following rheumatic fever. Senile aortic stenosis Senile, or degenerative, AS results from calcium deposition on the aortic surface of the valve. This is becoming an increasingly important disability problem in the elderly. Physical signs • The carotid pulse is slow rising with reduced amplitude. • The venous pressure is usually normal until late in the disease. 146 Valve disease Aortic stenosis Aortic regurgitation Signs Slow rising pulse Collapsing pulse ↓Pulse pressure ↑Pulse pressure Radiates to carotids EDM S1 EC ESM A2 P2 S1 S2 S1 S2 (soft) Can be palpable thrill Displaced, volume-loaded apex Causes Bicuspid valve Rheumatic valve disease Rheumatic valve disease Infective endocarditis Age-related calcification Marfan’s syndrome Endocarditis Inflammatory disease (ankylosing spondylitis, SLE, rheumatoid
