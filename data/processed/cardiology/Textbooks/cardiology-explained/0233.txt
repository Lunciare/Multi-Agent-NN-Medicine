is resistant to anticoagulation •an intraoperative decision on repair versus replacement will be made MV replacement NYHA class I–II symptoms, MVA ≤1 cm2, and severe pulmonary hypertension (>60 mm Hg) NYHA class III–IV symptoms, MVA ≤1.5 cm2, and not suitable for repair or valvotomy (calcification, fibrosis, subvalvular fusion) Table 5.Current recommendations for surgical therapy. LA: left atrium; MR: mitral regurgitation; MV: mitral valve; MVA: mitral valve area; NYHA:New York Heart Association. Both repair and percutaneous valvotomy acutely result in a doubling of the valve area and a 60% reduction in transmitral gradient. However, open commissurotomy and percutaneous valvotomy produce better long-term hemodynamic results. The current recommendations for percutaneous and surgical therapy are outlined in Table 5. Medical therapy Prophylaxis against rheumatic fever and endocarditis should be considered for all patients with MS. Agents with negative chronotropic properties, such as b-blockers or calcium-channel blockers, may benefit those in sinus rhythm with symptoms relating to exertional tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation AF develops in 40% of patients with symptomatic MS and should be treated according to standard protocols (see Chapter 8, Arrhythmia). The value of anticoagulation therapy for those with AF and those with a prior embolic event with or without AF is clear.
