if bruits are absent. • Before invasive electrophysiological testing, coronary artery disease should be excluded or treated. Electrophysiological testing is indicated whenever an arrhythmia is considered as a probable cause of syncope. • Exercise testing may contribute to establishing a basis for syncope by revealing myocardial ischemia (substrate for ventricular tachyarrhythmias), catecholamine-sensitive tachycardias, exercise-induced AV block, and chronotropic incompetence (SND). 115 Chapter 8 Arrhythmia Vasovagal Neurogenic Premonitory Often none Cough, micturition, Headache, confusion, standing, neck aura extension Episode Sudden Collapse, pale, Fit, eg, tongue biting, collapse unconscious incontinence <1 minute Recovery Feels well Feels ill Often prolonged postictal phase Table 4.Patterns of syncope.

CT: computed tomography; ECG: electrocardiogram; EEG: electroencephalogram; EP: electrophysiology; MRI: magnetic resonance imaging. Malignant vasovagal syncope In malignant vasovagal syncope, the sympathetic system is activated via a trigger, usually venous pooling, which forces vigorous contraction of a poorly filled ventricle. This stimulates the mechanoreceptors in the ventricular wall, which lead (via C fibers and the brainstem) to overactivation of the parasympathetic system, and
