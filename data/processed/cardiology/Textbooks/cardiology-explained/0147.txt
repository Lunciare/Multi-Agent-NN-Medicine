New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification (see Table 3). It is straightforward and provides a common language that is understood by cardiologists worldwide. Diagnosis and assessment The initial diagnosis and assessment of the severity and progression of CHF can be made using echo and exercise testing with gas analysis. The most commonly used echo measure is the EF. This is rated as: • 45%–70%, normal • 35%–45%, mildly impaired • 25%–35%, moderately impaired • <25%, severely impaired • <15%, end-stage/transplant candidates • 5% is compatible with life, but not long life The single best exercise-testing measurement is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption (VO max). In a situation where cardiac and respiratory causes of 2 dyspnea coexist, exercise testing with gas analysis can be particularly useful in discerning which is the greater problem. Treatment The first step in the management of CHF is patient education. It is easy for physicians to forget (since they use the term every day) that, to most patients, heart “failure” 100 Heart failure HISTORICAL HEARTS Hippocrates believed that the left side of the heart and its associated arteries were conduits for air rather than blood.
