vigorous contraction of a poorly filled ventricle. This stimulates the mechanoreceptors in the ventricular wall, which lead (via C fibers and the brainstem) to overactivation of the parasympathetic system, and thus bradycardia and hypotension. This reflex is named Bezold–Jarisch after those who first described it (see Figure 3). 116 Arrhythmia C fibers Brainstem Vigorous + Vagal efferents Hypotension contraction of a poorly filled ventricle Sympathetic activation Venous pooling Bradycardia Figure 3.The Bezold–Jarisch reflex. Tilt-table testing If malignant vasovagal syncope is suspected, the key investigation is upright tilt-table testing. This test is performed on a specially designed table with the patient initially in a supine position. He/she is then tilted upright to a maximum of 60°–80°in such a way as to avoid recruiting the postural muscles. This maximizes venous pooling. The patient is left in this position for up to 40minutes. The normal tilt-table response is a baroreceptor-mediated decrease in inhibitory drive to the vasomotor center, ie, vasoconstriction and an increase in heart rate and ventricular contractility. The test result is considered abnormal when symptomatic hypotension is reproduced (Bezold–Jarisch reflex). Treatment Therapy to prevent recurrent vasovagal syncope has included the use of b-blockers and vagolytics (eg, disopyramide). Atrioventricular block AV block
