Cardiology

most common in males younger than 20 years who are involved in endurance sports such as cycling, rowing, and cross-country skiing. In one series, 5% of over 1,000 consecutively examined athletes had structural abnormalities such as HCM or dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Dilated cardiomyopathy DCM is a primary disease of the cardiac muscle and can be defined as left or right ventricular dilatation and failure in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valve disease, or congenital heart abnormality. Patients usually present with shortness of breath and signs of congestion in an identical way to heart failure of any other cause. There are many causes of DCM: • alcohol • familial • myocarditis • postradiation or chemotherapy (eg, adriamycin/doxorubicin) • hemochromatosis • thyrotoxicosis • thiamine deficiency 186 Cardiomyopathy Prognosis The prognosis is variable according to the degree of ventricular damage. It is generally agreed that patients with resistant high filling pressures do badly. Those with biventricular dilatation and impairment of function do even worse. Investigations The ECG shows no specific signs: it may be normal or show conduction disturbances. Chest x-ray shows increased cardiothoracic ratio and pulmonary vascular congestion. Echo is the test of choice and will show a grossly dilated
