heart failure is dyspnea. The classic combination of raised jugular venous pressure (JVP), peripheral edema, palpable liver, basal crepitations, tachycardia, and a third heart sound is well known. Orthopnea (shortness of breath when lying flat) and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea (acute nocturnal shortness of breath) are both manifestations of decompensation of ventricular function – precipitated by diurnal susceptibility and increased venous return resulting from adoption of the supine position. In an elderly person, the cause of acute shortness of breath can often be difficult to diagnose, and the chest may reveal nothing but coarse breath sounds throughout. In this situation, two factors are helpful: the JVP and overt sympathetic overactivation (cold peripheries and profuse sweating). 95 ecroF Chapter 7 Chronic heart failure Reduced cardiac output Central and peripheral hypoxia Inflammatory cytokine Renin–angiotensin– Sympathetic activation aldosterone activity Endothelial dysfunction Exercise intolerance Figure 2.Chronic heart failure. TNF: tumor necrosis factor. Investigations Electrocardiography The electrocardiogram of a patient with heart failure often shows LV hypertrophy (LVH). This may show a “strain” pattern (LVH plus ST depression), most commonly in the lateral chest leads. Arrhythmias are also common in heart failure. Chest x-ray Classic signs on CXRs are common only for acute heart failure. Typically,
