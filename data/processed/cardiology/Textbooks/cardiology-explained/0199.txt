are likely to be added to the standard ones (see Table 7). Pacemaker codes Pacemaker codes are, to many, one of the most confusing aspects of electrocardiology (see Table8). In fact, the labels, which are standardized, tell you all you need to know about the underlying programming and, in combination with the basic electrical wiring diagram of the heart (see Figure 1), can allow you to diagnose most problems. The first letter refers to the chamber or chambers paced (atrium, ventricle, both [dual]). The second letter refers to the chamber sensed (atrium, ventricle, both [dual]) and the third letter details the response to sensing (triggered, inhibited, both [dual]). Thus, the most common pacemaker codes are the following. (1) DDD – this box senses both chambers and if it detects a missing or late atrial or ventricular contraction it will pace one or both. The most common scenarios are: • sinus bradycardia – atrial pacing will “kick in” and, assuming AV conduction is normal, no ventricular pacing will occur • AV block (Mobitz type II; third-degree) – the ventricle is paced either following a normal atrial contraction or a paced atrial contraction. The benefit of this – that ventricular contraction will
