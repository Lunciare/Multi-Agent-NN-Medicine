build up to maintenance dosages shown to be effective in large trials • Monitor renal function/electrolytes during drug titration every 3–5 days until stable, and then at 3 months and subsequently at 6-monthly intervals. If renal function deteriorates substantially, stop treatment • Avoid potassium-sparing diuretics during initiation of therapy. Add potassium- sparing diuretics only with persisting hypokalemia or refractory natriuretic therapy. However, spironolactone can safely be added at a dose of 25 mg, since at this dose it has no effect on potassium levels and diuresis • Avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs • Check blood pressure 1–2 weeks after each dose increment The following patients should be referred for specialist care: Cause of heart failure unknown Systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg Serum creatinine >1.47 mg/dL (130 mmol/L) Serum sodium <130 mmol/L Moderate or severe heart failure Valve disease Table 6.The recommended procedure for starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI).
