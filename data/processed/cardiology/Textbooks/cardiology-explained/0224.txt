is a medical emergency in its own right. A large regurgitant volume is suddenly imposed on an LV of normal size that has not had time to accommodate to the volume overload. The result is a reduction in stroke volume, compensatory tachycardia, pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock. Characteristic clinical findings are absent and an echo is essential to document the severity of the lesion. This is done by assessing the speed of equilibration of aortic and LV pressures in diastole. Useful echo measures are short regurgitant wave half time, short mitral deceleration time, and premature closure of the MV. Mortality is high in acute severe AR and early surgical intervention is essential. Nitroprusside can be helpful in reducing preload and afterload, possibly in combination with dobutamine or dopamine. Intra-aortic balloon pumping is absolutely contraindicated (it increases aortic diastolic pressure and worsens the regurgitation), while b-blockers, often used in the management of dissection, should be used with caution in associated acute severe AR as they dampen the compensatory tachycardia. Chronic aortic regurgitation An early diastolic murmur is always justification for referral to a cardiologist for assessment and echo. Causes • Rheumatic involvement of the aortic valve, resulting in thickening of the
