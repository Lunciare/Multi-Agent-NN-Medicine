alternative test if the preprobability is low. If the preprobability is high, exercise testing adds little in the way of diagnosis, but is useful for risk stratification. The primary role of exercise testing is where preprobability is intermediate. Nuclear cardiology Isotopes such as thallium-201 or technetium (Tc)-99m can be used to provide information on cardiac function. 59 Chapter 5 ST-segment Ischemia- Angina during Prognosis Duration of deviation during reading exercise exercise Average exercise line 5-year annual survival mortality MET Min 0 mm None 0.99 0.2% 20 18 0.98 0.4% 17 15 0.95 1% 13 12 Nonlimiting 0.93 1.5% 10 9 1 mm 0.90 2% 0.85 3% 7 6 0.80 4% 0.75 5% Exercise-limiting 0.70 6% 5 3 0 0 0.55 9% 2 mm 3 mm 4 mm Figure 6.The Duke score, which is the most commonly used risk score, can be used for diagnosis as well as prognosis. To use this nomogram: determine (i) the maximum amount of downsloping or planar ST depression, and (ii) the type of angina during exercise. Connect these to give a point on the ischemia reading line. Then connect this point to the MET level (or duration of the Bruce protocol). Where this line dissects
