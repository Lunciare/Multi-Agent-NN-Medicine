with a moderate side-effect profile (most commonly hypokalemia, dyslipidemia, and gout). Potassium levels should be checked regularly. Loop diuretics have a role to play in the place of thiazides when renal function is compromised (creatinine >180 mmol/L or 2mg/dL) and on a short-term basis, in addition to thiazides, in resistant hypertension, where a significant proportion of patients suffer plasma volume overload. Calcium-channel blockers A large number of calcium-channel blockers have been developed and there is good evidence of their ability to reduce BP. There are three subclasses: the dihydropyridines (nifedipine-like), the phenylalkylamine derivatives (verapamil), and the benzothiazepines (diltiazem). All work by blocking the entry of calcium into the smooth muscle cells of resistance vessels, thereby causing vasodilatation. Dihydropyridines cause vasodilatation without the bradycardic and negatively inotropic effects of diltiazem and verapamil (which limits the use of the latter agents to patients with normal left ventricular function) – so a simpler classification is “rate-limiting” and “non-rate-limiting”. Short-acting dihydropyridines have become unpopular following reports of increased risk of MI at high doses. Longer-acting calcium-channel blockers are useful antihypertensives, especially as they are lipid-neutral. Side effects include ankle edema, headache, and flushing. 84 Hypertension Renin/angiotensin system antagonists Angiotensin is a potent vasoconstrictor, but
