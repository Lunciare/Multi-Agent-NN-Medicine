the result is generally acute decompensation. Without time for compensatory LV and LA dilatation, the increase in ventricular preload leads to a decreased stroke volume and pulmonary congestion. However, examination findings may not be typical: • there may be no hyperdynamic apex beat • the systolic murmur may be short • there may be a fourth heart sound The most common cause of acute MR is papillary muscle rupture secondary to myocardial infarction (MI) (seeFigure 5). In this situation, the principal differential diagnosis is ventricular septal defect and an echo is required to differentiate between the two. Ventricular septal defect is more likely with: • right-sided radiation of murmur • raised jugular venous pressure (JVP) • anterior MI (inferior MI is more likely to cause acute MR) The goal of medical therapy in acute severe MR is to diminish regurgitation, increase stroke volume, and reduce pulmonary congestion. As such, nitroprusside alone or in combination with dobutamine (if blood pressure is low) can be 157 Chapter 9 Figure 6.Echocardiogram showing a vegetation on the mitral valve (arrow).
