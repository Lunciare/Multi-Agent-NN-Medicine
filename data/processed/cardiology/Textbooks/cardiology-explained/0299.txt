but all are exposed to the risk of infective endocarditis. Atrial septal defect Three types of atrial septal defect (ASD) can occur: • ostium secundum is the most common type (70%). It can be large, but usually does not affect the atrioventricular valves (see Figures 3 and4) • ostium primum – the hole is situated close to the atrioventricular valves and can be associated with an atrioventricular septal defect 205 Chapter 14 Ventricular septal defect Atrial septal defect Biventricular hypertrophy LAD, RBBB (primum) RVH RVH, RAD, RBBB (secundum) PSM MSM (MDM) Table 1. Characteristics of atrial septal defect and ventricular septal defect. Note the wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound in atrial septal defect. LAD: left axis deviation; MDM: mid diastolic murmur; MSM: mid systolic murmur; PSM: pansystolic accentuation of murmur; RAD: right axis deviation; RBBB: right bundle branch block; RVH: right ventricular hypertrophy.

It is unusual and is often associated with partial anomalous pulmonary venous drainage
