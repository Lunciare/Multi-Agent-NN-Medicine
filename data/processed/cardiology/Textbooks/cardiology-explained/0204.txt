Cardiology

an unexpected discovery: if a heart stopped beating due to cooling, it could be started again by artificial stimulation using mechanical or electrical means. In 1950, this led to Hopps’ invention of the world’s first cardiac pacemaker. His device was far too large to be implanted inside the human body – it was an external pacemaker. 137 Chapter 8 Once all the required tests are completed, the pacemaker pocket (in the fascia overlying the pectoral muscle) is created by blunt dissection and the wound sutured. Complications Acute complications will generally occur in hospital. These may include pneumothorax, RV perforation and cardiac tamponade, and hematoma. Chronic complications are more likely to present to the generalist. Lead infection is fortunately rare, but can present a very difficult management problem. Skin commensals are the most common culprits in right-sided endocarditis. If you suspect this, you should immediately refer the patient for an echo and blood cultures. Treatment is initially with antibiotics, but the lead system should be quickly replaced if this is unsuccessful. Lead displacement can occur as a result of concurrent right-sided pathology, eg, RV dilatation or valve abnormalities, and can be detected by changes in threshold. Changes in impedance can point
