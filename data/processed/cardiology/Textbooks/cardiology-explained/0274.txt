maintain right ventricle capture at higher heart rates. Nonsurgical septal reduction A recent technique involving cardiac catheterization has been proposed as an alternative for outflow tract pressure gradient reduction and symptom improvement. This technique came to light following observations, in the early eighties, that upon balloon inflation in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery there is a reduction of outflow tract velocities and gradients. The procedure involves balloon inflation in the proximal segment of the first septal perforator of the LAD and assessment of outflow tract gradient. If the gradient drops significantly, a small quantity of alcohol (3–5 mL) is injected down the cannulated artery, distal to the balloon, in an attempt to induce a localized proximal septal infarction. The velocities are then measured. The stress-induced outflow tract gradient after dobutamine injection is also assessed, both before and after the procedure. If the results are not satisfactory, these steps are repeated while cannulating the second perforator of the LAD. Procedural success is always associated with significant myocardial enzyme rise and a fall in outflow tract velocities, development of significant conduction disturbance, and septal incoordinate relaxation. Mid- and long-term follow-up after nonsurgical septal reduction have proved promising in terms of
