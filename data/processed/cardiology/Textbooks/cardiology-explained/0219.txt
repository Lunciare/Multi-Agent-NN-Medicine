the pulsation of the heart in a more distinct manner than he could before do with the naked ear. Having hit upon the principle he extended its application to the investigation of the various sounds produced in the chest by the respiration, the voice, and the accidental presence of fluids in the lung, pleural sac, and pericardium.” Mediate Auscultation, 1816. (Quoted in The Lancet1998;352:997.) aCorpulence, physically bulky. Severe stenosis causes a transvalvular pressure gradient of >50 mm Hg in the presence of normal transvalvular flow (ie, normal LV function). However, abnormally low pressure gradients are found in conditions of LV dysfunction, so the gradient alone is not a clear guide. The natural history of AS is one of slow progression. Studies suggest that some patients exhibit a decrease in valve area of 0.1–0.3 cm2/year, although no progression is discernible in many patients. However, regardless of the individual variability, symptoms of angina, syncope, or heart failure generally develop after a latent period. At this point, the outlook changes dramatically. After the onset of symptoms, the average survival is less than 3 years. Thus, development of symptoms is the critical point in the natural history of AS and thereafter the benefits of
