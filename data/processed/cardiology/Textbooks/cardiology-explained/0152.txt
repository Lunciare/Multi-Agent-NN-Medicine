frequent measurement of creatine and electrolytes Potassium-sparing diuretics (triamterene, amiloride, spironolactone): • Use only if hypokalemia persists after initiation of therapy with ACEIs and diuretics • Start 1-week, low-dose administration • Potassium supplements are usually ineffective Table 5.Treatment of heart failure with diuretics (loop diuretics, thiazides, metolazone). ACEI: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; CHF: chronic heart failure; GFR: glomerular filtration rate.

Stop diuretics, if being used, for 24hours • It may be advisable to start treatment in the evening, when supine, to minimize the potential negative effect on blood pressure, although there are no data in heart failure to support this. When initiated in the morning, supervision for several hours with blood pressure control is advisable • Start with a low dose and build up to maintenance dosages shown to be effective in large trials • Monitor renal function/electrolytes during drug titration every 3–5 days until stable, and then at 3 months and
