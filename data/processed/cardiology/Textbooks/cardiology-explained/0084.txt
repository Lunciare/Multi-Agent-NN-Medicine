Cardiology

information is gathered over a much shorter time with a fast gamma camera. Stress echocardiography Stress echo is gaining in popularity because it has: • a higher predictive value than exercise ECG • a lower cost and better safety profile than perfusion scintigraphy Ultrasound is used to detect the difference in wall movement between ischemic and nonischemic myocardium (nonischemic myocardium moves less). Furthermore, the location of the wall-motion abnormalities enables the coronary 61 Chapter 5 disease pattern to be predicted – this is not possible from ST-segment depression on an exercise ECG. Stress echo is thus indicated when: • LBBB is present on the resting ECG • the exercise ECG is inconclusive for other reasons • immobility or lung disease precludes the practical use of exercise as a cardiac stress (pharmacological stress echo only) Stress echo can also provide information on stunned or hibernating myocardium. The former is myocardium that after a period of acute ischemia and reperfusion remains, for a time, hypokinetic at rest. Hibernating myocardium is a more chronic situation in which the blood flow of a segment is not adequate for function, yet is sufficient for it to remain viable. During periods of stress, these areas of
