according to standard protocols (see Chapter 8, Arrhythmia). The value of anticoagulation therapy for those with AF and those with a prior embolic event with or without AF is clear. However, there is no evidence that oral anticoagulation is beneficial in those with MS who have neither AF nor a prior embolic event. The frequency of embolic events does not seem to be related to the severity of MS, the size of the LA, or the presence of symptoms. There is some controversy over 156 Valve disease (a) (b) Figure 5.(a) Transesophageal echocardiography showing a tear in the papillary muscle (the most common cause of acute mitral regurgitation).(b) The same scene with a color jet from the left ventricle into the left atrium, demonstrating “blood flow” in the wrong direction. whether percutaneous mitral valvotomy should be performed in patients with new- onset AF and moderate or severe MS who are otherwise asymptomatic. Mitral regurgitation Acute mitral regurgitation In acute severe mitral regurgitation (MR), the hemodynamic changes are not tolerated and the result is generally acute decompensation. Without time for compensatory LV and LA dilatation, the increase in ventricular preload leads to a decreased stroke volume and pulmonary congestion. However, examination
