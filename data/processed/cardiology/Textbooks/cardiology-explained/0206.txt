you suspect deep infection for another reason, eg, marked constitutional symptoms, refer immediately. Infections resistant to antibiotic therapy demand box and lead extraction – a procedure not without difficulty or complications. Pacemaker syndrome occurs in some patients with a VVI pacemaker who are in SR. It is thought to relate to the fact that although sometimes the atria contract “in time” and cardiac output is normal, at other times they contract against closed AV valves, which causes elevated venous pressure and a fall in cardiac output. The patient will experience dizziness, and the solution is to upgrade the patient to a DDD pacemaker. Finally, atrial-sensing pacemakers, eg, DDD, respond to atrial arrhythmia with tachycardic pacing. If this happens, it is possible to alter the program (to DDI or set 138 Arrhythmia an upper rate limit) or use antiarrhythmic drugs. This problem can be avoided by using a mode-switching pacemaker that detects atrial arrhythmia and switches to VVI. Pacemaker ECGs ECGs are harder to interpret in a patient with a pacemaker as there are more variables; although the pacing spikes are usually straightforward to recognize. It is important to remember that the paced QRS complex will be in an LBBB pattern
