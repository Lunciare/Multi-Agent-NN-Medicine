Most cases are identified by screening family members of known sufferers – 50% of cases are familial. Background HCM is a primary, usually familial disorder of cardiac muscle with complex pathophysiology, significant heterogeneity in its expression, and a diverse clinical course. It is defined as cardiac hypertrophy that cannot be explained by pressure or volume overload, and is probably the most common genetically transmitted heart disease. The clinical course is highly variable; some patients remain asymptomatic throughout life, whereas others die prematurely – either suddenly or from progressive heart failure. HCM is characterized by mutations in the DNA encoding cardiac contractile or energy-related proteins, predominantly the b-myosin heavy chain, a-tropomyosin, and cardiac troponin T (see Figure1 and Table 1). Despite dramatic improvements in the knowledge and understanding of HCM, challenges and controversies still exist regarding its diagnosis, etiology, natural history, and management. For example, many
