The layers of pericardium. The visceral pericardium is a tissue paper-like layer, while the parietal pericardium is more rigid. 197 Chapter 13 Causes of pericarditis Postmyocardial infarction/postcardiac surgery Viral (Coxsackie B, influenza) Metastatic malignancy Uremia Tuberculous Systemic lupus erythematosus Table 1.Causes of pericarditis. The causes of pericarditis are outlined in Table 1. Viral pericarditis is the most common type, but in many cases either the diagnosis is never made or the viral infection is never identified. Another common presentation is characteristic pain 3–14 days postmyocardial infarction (MI) or postcardiac surgery, which tends to be self-limiting. Relapsing episodes are referred to as Dressler’s syndrome or postcardiotomy syndrome, and are thought to represent an autoimmune process. Investigations Examination Auscultation may reveal a pericardial rub, which is sufficient, but not necessary, to make the diagnosis. It can easily be distinguished from a pleural rub by asking the patient to hold their breath. Electrocardiography The classic sign of pericarditis – a concave upwards (“saddle”) ST-segment elevation throughout the 12 leads – is, of course, rare. However, some form of electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality is common. These changes are either present in all 12 leads or in leads that do not correspond to the territory perfused
