edema. 102 Heart failure Class Compound Mechanism of action Loop Furosemide Inhibit triporter pump in thick ascending diuretics (frusemide), loop of Henle, thus inhibiting Na+ and bumetanide, Cl– reabsorption, which leads to diuresis torasemide and potentially hypokalemia Thiazide Bendrofluazide, Inhibit NaCl reabsorption in the distal diuretics hydrochlorothiazide tubule. The greater Na+ load in the distal tubule stimulates Na+ exchange with K+ and H+, causing hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis Metolazone Particularly potent diuretic, especially when combined with a loop diuretic Potassium-sparing Amiloride Blocks Na+channels in the distal diuretics nephron Spironolactone Aldosterone antagonist Table 4.Diuretics used in the treatment of heart failure. Treatment of heart failure with diuretics Initial diuretic treatment: • Loop diuretics or thiazides. Always combine with ACEI • If GFR 230 mL/min do not use thiazides, except as therapy prescribed synergistically with loop diuretics Insufficient response: (1) Combine loop diuretics and thiazides (2) Increase dose of diuretic (3) With persistent fluid retention – administer loop diuretics twice daily (4) In severe CHF add metolazone or low-dose spironolactone (25–50mg) with frequent measurement of creatine and electrolytes Potassium-sparing diuretics (triamterene, amiloride, spironolactone): • Use only if hypokalemia persists after initiation of therapy with ACEIs and diuretics • Start 1-week, low-dose administration
