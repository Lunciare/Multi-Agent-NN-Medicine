tender, pulsatile liver and, occasionally, mild jaundice • a pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal edge that is increased by inspiration Management Severe tricuspid regurgitation resulting from any cause is associated with a poor long-term outcome due to RV dysfunction and systemic venous congestion. The timing of surgery and the most suitable operation remain controversial, although chordal reconstruction and annuloplasty have become established in recent years. 162 Valve disease Annuloplasty involves the use of a prosthetic ring to support the endogenous dilated annulus. Valve replacement is also possible. Medical management treats fluid retention and AF. Standard protocols are used, although high doses and combination diuretics are often required. Pulmonary valve disease Pulmonary regurgitation is caused by pulmonary hypertension and annular dilatation resulting from various causes of left-sided heart disease (as well as primary pulmonary hypertension). An early diastolic murmur (Graham Steell murmur) is heard over the pulmonary area and should be distinguished from that of AR. Antibiotic prophylaxis is only required if the cause is rheumatic. Most pulmonary valve disease does not need treatment. However, valve replacement can be carried out in cases of intractable right heart failure. Valve disease in pregnancy In pregnancy, there is a 50% increase
