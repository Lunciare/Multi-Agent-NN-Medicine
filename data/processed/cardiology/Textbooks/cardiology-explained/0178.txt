itself an indication for pacing. However, when combined with intermittent second- or third-degree block, a DDD pacemaker should be fitted. Trifascicular block Trifascicular block refers to a block of all three fascicles (but with intact AV conduction). It usually refers to LBBB + a long PR interval. Although trifascicular block is not strictly speaking an indication for permanent pacing, some centers carry this out on the basis that it must reflect extensive conducting tissue damage. 121 CH7_FIG10 Chapter 8 I aVR V1 V4 II aVL V2 V5 III aVF V3 V6 Figure 10.Left axis deviation. Nonspecific intraventricular conduction defect Another term that is sometimes used is “nonspecific intraventricular conduction defect”. This usually refers to an abnormal ECG that does not clearly fit any of the patterns described above. The QRS complex will generally not be wide, but the waveform will be atypical. It is of unknown significance, but is likely to be benign. Tachyarrhythmia The general principle of patient management outlined at the beginning of this chapter holds true for patients suffering from tachyarrhythmia: is the patient compromised? And, as above, the use of an ECG will be critical when making the diagnosis. However, you will often be called to
