of bone marrow suppression.) Abciximab – a chimeric murine–human Fab1fragment monoclonal antibody – and the small molecule inhibitors tirofiban and eptifibatide are members of a new class of antithrombotics. These agents function by inhibiting glycoprotein (GP)IIb/IIIa, a receptor abundant on platelets. When platelets are activated, this receptor binds fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor, leading to platelet aggregation. The benefit from these agents almost certainly relates to microembolization since: • there is good evidence from autopsy studies that, following spontaneous or instrumented coronary plaque disruption, small aggregates of platelets, cholesterol, or other plaque material can be found in distal microvessels • it has been demonstrated, using filter devices and contrast echo, that microembolization is common following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is almost certainly the basis of “no reflow” – when perfusion is limited following PCI despite adequate restoration of flow in the infarct-related artery • troponin levels, which are thought to be a sensitive marker for this type of damage, are elevated following approximately 40% of procedures. (Note that, in unstable angina, the benefit of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors is not limited to those with elevated troponin levels.) 64 Coronary artery disease Deployed stent Guidewire Contrast dye inflates balloon Atheroma Figure 8.Balloon
