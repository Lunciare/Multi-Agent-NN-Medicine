drug, and the choice should be rational. Here, synergistic action is important (see Figure 2). Good combinations are: • thiazides (which cause secondary hyperreninemia) and ACEIs or ARBs (which block it) • b-blockers (which act to reduce renin release and cardiac output) and calcium-channel blockers (which cause vasodilatation – do not combine b-blockers with verapamil or diltiazem) Following this, it is generally worth trying one of the other classes mentioned above. Treatment will be highly individualized depending on patient tolerance and efficacy, but some guidelines are outlined in Table 5. It is worth taking readings after each change of drug so that agents with no effect can be stopped. Systolic versus diastolic hypertension The question as to the relative importance of systolic and diastolic BP is common in the management of hypertension. For many years it was felt that as systolic hypertension was more common in the elderly it was an inevitable part of aging and arteriolar 86 Hypertension Diuretics b-blockers ACE inhibitors Examples Bendrofluazide, Atenolol, Lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide bisoprolol ramipril Particularly Elderly patients The young, Diabetics good in: anxious patients Contraindicated in: Gout Asthma, Pregnancy, heart block renovascular disease Angiotensin Calcium- a-blockers type 1 receptor channel antagonists blockers Examples Losartan,
