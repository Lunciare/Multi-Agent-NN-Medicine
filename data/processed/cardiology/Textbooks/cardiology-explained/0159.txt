include abnormal interventricular septal wall motion, reduced diastolic filling time, and prolonged mitral regurgitation duration. In addition, there is a proportional increase in mortality with increasing QRS duration. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) provides atrial-synchronized, biventricular pacing using standard pacing technology combined with a special third lead. This third lead is implanted via the coronary sinus and positioned in a cardiac vein to sense and pace the left ventricle. Following a sensed atrial contraction, both ventricles are stimulated to contract simultaneously. The resulting resynchronization of ventricular contraction reduces mitral regurgitation and optimizes left ventricular filling, thereby improving cardiac function. Transplantation and ventricular assist devices are options for end-stage disease. Local availability and guidelines vary. Indications are: • severe LV dysfunction (eg, EF <20% as demonstrated by radionuclide ventriculography) • VO max <14 mL/kg/min (patients with values above this tend 2 to have a better prognosis without surgery) 107 Chapter 7 Contraindications center on comorbidities, eg, vasculopathy, diabetes mellitus with target-organ damage, or pulmonary hypertension. In addition, few centers will transplant patients over the age of 60 years. Several studies have shown clear benefit from a multidisciplinary approach to heart failure treatment.
