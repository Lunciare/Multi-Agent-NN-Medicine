Cardiology

a vascular graft, reimplantation of the coronary arteries, and resuspension of the aortic valve. In some cases it may be necesssary to replace the valve. In contrast, type B dissection is managed medically by aggressive antihypertensive treatment. In the acute situation, the systolic BP should be lowered to <110mmHg using intravenous (IV) b-blockade (eg, labetalol). Beta-blockade, as well as reducing the BP, reduces the BP’s rate of rise and for this reason it is preferred to sodium nitroprusside as the first-line IV agent. If b-blockers are contraindicated then rate-limiting calcium-channel blockers, such as diltiazem or verapamil, can be used. 193 Chapter 12 (a) (b) Figure 7.(a,b) Chest x-rays. A dissected aorta can be seen in (b) (arrow). Figure 8.Chest x-ray showing extreme dissection of the aorta (arrows). Dissection typically presents with a severe tearing central chest pain that radiates to the back. A patient with such a history should be referred urgently to a specialist center since the ascending aorta might be involved. Immediate investigations include: • CT or MRI scan (see Figures 4 and5, previous page) • transesophageal echo to assess possible aortic regurgitation (see Figure 6,previous page) • transthoracic echo for pericardial effusion • preoperatively, coronary artery disease
