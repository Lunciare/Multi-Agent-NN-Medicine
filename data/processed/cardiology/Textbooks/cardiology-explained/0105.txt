of sliding-scale insulin. Oral inotropes should be avoided since almost all randomized trials have shown an increased mortality over placebo. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and b-blockers are given within the first 24 hours post-MI (in the absence of hypotension or other specific contraindications). However, although there is clear evidence for the benefit of each 72 Coronary artery disease Intima Internal elastic External elastic Medial Adventitia lamina lamina layer Figure 11.The walls of normal blood vessels are composed of distinct layers: the intima is the innermost layer. It consists of a single layer of endothelial cells lining the vessel, supported by a layer of connective tissue. The media is composed of smooth muscle cells and is sandwiched betweenthe internal and external elastic laminae. The adventitia is the outermost layer and consists mostly of collagen fibers that protect the blood vessel. agent individually, there are few data on their effect when used in combination. Until further data are available, both should be given together. Short-acting calcium-channel blockers of the dihydropyridine type are contraindicated in acute MI. The longer-acting dihydropyridines may reduce reinfarction in patients with a first non-Q-wave infarction or inferior infarction in the absence of LV dysfunction and pulmonary edema. However, their
