inhibitors (see above). Patients with positive troponin levels should undergo immediate catheterization. Otherwise, patients should rest until they are pain-free. After 48 hours without pain, patients should undergo cardiac catheterization. 69 lamron fo timil reppU x Chapter 5 Myocardial infarction If MI is confirmed by history and ST elevation (1 mm in limb leads, 2 mm in chest leads, or new LBBB) or elevated troponin plus either of these, the patient must quickly be taken to the catheterization laboratory. If this facility is not available, the doctor should immediately: (1) rule out contraindications to thrombolysis (see “Thrombolysis” section) and (2) arrange for analgesia and thrombolysis to be set up, before (3) completing the history and examination. Primary PTCA Recently – primarily due to improvements in devices, adjunctive therapy (GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors), and user experience – in cases of acute MI, the superiority of PTCA over thrombolysis alone has become clear. Most lesions (80%) are suitable for PTCA, particularly if they are discrete, proximal, uncalcified, subtotally occluded, without thrombus, and away from the side branches or divisions of a vessel. As such, primary PTCA is the procedure of choice for patients within 12hours of the onset of MI symptoms. Current evidence suggests
