(which is why it is sometimes spelt the Dutch way), Einthoven credits Waller with this distinction in his 1895 publication in Pflügers Archives “Über die Form des menschlichen Elektrokardiogramms”. 25 Chapter 3 aVR V1 V4 I aVL V2 V5 II aVF V3 V6 III Figure 12.ECG demonstrating left ventricular hypertrophy. Note also the T-wave inversion in leads V4–V6. This is often labeled “strain”. aVR V1 V4 I aVL V2 V5 II aVF V3 V6 III Figure 13.ECG demonstrating left bundle branch block. Q waves A normal ECG has only very small Q waves. A downward deflection immediately following a P wave that is wider than two small squares or greater in height than a third of the subsequent R wave is significant: such Q waves canrepresent previous infarction (see Figure 11, previous page). 26 Conquering the ECG Left bundle branch block Right bundle branch block V1 V6 V1 V6 Figure 14.The shapes of V1 and V6 QRS complexes in left and right bundle branch block.
