in transthoracic impedance that can be used to detect changes in ventilation or RV filling; and QT sensors that respond to the shortening of the paced QT interval by catecholamines. 136 Arrhythmia Paced Sensed Response Rate A A T R V V I D D D Table 8.Pacemaker codes. A: atrium; D: dual (ie, both chambers or both responses); I: inhibited; R: rate responsive; T: triggered; V: ventricle. Implantation Pacemaker implantation is carried out under sedation. Leads are inserted via the subclavian or cephalic vein into the RA and/or RV. Atrial leads are J-shaped and are positioned in the right atrial appendage (anteriorly and superiorly in the RA). Ventricular leads are positioned in the RV apex. Most ventricular leads are placed in position and left against the myocardial wall. In certain circumstances, eg, when these leads become easily displaced or do not provide adequate threshold values, an active fixation lead can be used. This lead has a screw “thread” on its end – usually covered by a dissolvable tip, so that it is not exposed until it is in position – that allows the lead to be fixed into the myocardium. After the leads are positioned, a series of tests
