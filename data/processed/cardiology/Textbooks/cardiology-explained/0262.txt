Cardiology

underlying cardiac function as well as demonstrate vegetations. Chamber size, pre-existing rheumatic disease, and valve apparatus can be examined and the degree of valve incompetence assessed. Transthoracic two-dimensional echo can detect vegetations above 2 mm in diameter, whereas TEE has greater precision in detection of lesions (1–1.5 mm), with a sensitivity and specificity of over 90% (see Figure 3). Detection of prosthetic endocarditis is more sensitive with TEE. Other investigations Other investigations include the following: • blood count – normochromic normocytic anemia is usual, while neutrophil leucocytosis is common • ESR – this may be raised • renal and liver function test – levels of creatinine may be raised; levels of liver enzymes may be raised in a hepatocellular (nonobstructive) pattern • CRP – increases acutely in bacterial infection • urine microscopy – microscopic hematuria is common in early disease • culture – culture any skin lesion, drip site, or other focus of infection • electrocardiography (ECG) – ECG regularly (daily if aortic or septal root abscess is suspected) Treatment Antibiotics If, following blood cultures, the diagnosis is secure, high-dose IV antibiotics should be started immediately. It is becoming increasingly common to insert a 174 Infective endocarditis tunneled central line
