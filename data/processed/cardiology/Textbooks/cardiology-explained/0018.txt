ECG terminology has two meanings for the word “lead”: • the cable used to connect an electrode to the ECG recorder • the electrical view of the heart obtained from any one combination of electrodes Carrying out anECG 1) Ask the patient to undress down to the waist and lie down 2) Remove excess hair where necessary 3) Attach limb leads (anywhere on the limb) 4) Attach the chest leads (see Figure 1) as follows: • V1 and V2: either side of the sternum on the fourth rib (count down from the sternal angle, the second rib insertion) • V4: on the apex of the heart (feel for it) • V3: halfway between V2 and V4 • V5 and V6: horizontally laterally from V4 (not up towards the axilla) 5) Ask the patient to relax 6) Press record 15 Chapter 3 1 2 Angle of Louis 3 4 5 V2 6 V1 V6 V3 V5 V4 Figure 1.Standard attachment sites for chest leads. The standard ECG uses 10 cables to obtain 12 electrical views of the heart. The different views reflect the angles at which electrodes “look” at the heart and the direction of
