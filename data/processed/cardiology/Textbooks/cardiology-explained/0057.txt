chest pain. Sweating, nausea, and vomiting are suggestive of MI, while complications of MI – such as heart failure (third heart sound and basal crackles) ventricular septal defect (VSD), harsh systolic murmur, or papillary muscle rupture – should be excluded. Atypical chest pain A common presentation in general practice is chest pain accompanied by an atypical history. In such cases, it is essential that the history is accurately established and documented. The most common noncardiac cause is dyspepsia. Although chest pain following a big meal could have a cardiac, gastroesophageal, or biliary origin, pain resulting from exercise is rarely biliary.

Other noncardiac causes to consider are musculoskeletal, pericardial, and pleural. 47 Chapter 5 Major independent Predisposing Possible risk factors risk factors risk factors Cigarette smoking Physical inactivitya Fibrinogen Hypertension Obesitya C-reactive protein Elevated total and Family history of premature Homocysteine LDL cholesterol coronary disease Elevated Lp(a) Low HDL cholesterol Ethnicity Diabetes mellitus Psychosocial factors Older age Table 2.American Heart Association guide to risk factors for coronary artery disease.
