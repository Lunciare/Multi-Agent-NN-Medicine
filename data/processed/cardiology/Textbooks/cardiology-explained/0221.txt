coronary angiography before AVR in patients with risk factors for CAD; (2) to assess the severity of AS in symptomatic patients when AVR is planned or when noninvasive tests are inconclusive (catheterization allows accurate quantification of the orifice because it can account for transvalvular flow). Contrary to popular belief, exercise testing is not contraindicated for mild to moderate AS patients and can give useful information with respect to exercise capacity, heart rate recovery, and exercise-induced rise in blood pressure. Balloon valvotomy Percutaneous balloon aortic valvotomy (stretching a stenotic valve by balloon inflation) has an important role to play in the treatment of young adults with AS, but a very limited role in older patients. This is because the postoperative valve area is rarely >1 cm2 and because complications are frequent (10%) and serious. This procedure can act as a “bridge” to reduce the requirement for surgery (with its inherent risk) in adult patients with refractory pulmonary edema or cardiogenic shock. Aortic valve replacement in the elderly Due to the limitations of medical therapy and balloon valvotomy, AVR should be considered for all elderly patients with symptomatic AS. However, the decision as to whether to carry out AVR is rarely straightforward
