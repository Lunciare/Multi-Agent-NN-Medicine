An exercise-induced increase in blood flow may exert its beneficial effects on vascular reactivity and structure through an increase in the elaboration of several endothelium- derived substances, such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and superoxide dismutase. Although prostacyclin may exert its antiatherogenic effects by inhibiting the uptake of cholesterol esters into
