(see Figures 5 and6). Primum ASD requires prophylaxis for infective endocarditis, while secundum ASD doesnot. Eisenmenger syndrome This is the name given to reversal in the direction of a cardiac shunt caused by the development of pulmonary hypertension. It applies regardless of whether the shunt is atrial or ventricular. Initial flow is always from high pressure (left) to low pressure (right), but pulmonary pressure can rise above systemic pressure and cause a reversal of flow. Signs of pulmonary hypertension are RVH, pulmonary systolic click, and loud pulmonary valve closure. CXR shows large main pulmonary arteries and branches with peripheral pruning. After the development of Eisenmenger physiology, only heart–lung transplantation is of value in management. 207 Chapter 14 Clamshell occluder LA RA IVC Figure 5.The Clamshell occluder for closure of an atrial septal defect.
