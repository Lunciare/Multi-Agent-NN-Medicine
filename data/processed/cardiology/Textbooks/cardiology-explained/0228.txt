surgery is not recommended • long-term therapy in asymptomatic patients with severe regurgitation who have LV dilatation, but normal systolic function • long-term therapy in asymptomatic patients with hypertension and any degree of regurgitation • long-term therapy in patients with persistent LV systolic dysfunction after AVR (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) • short-term therapy to improve the hemodynamic profile of patients with severe heart failure symptoms and severe LV dysfunction before proceeding with AVR Asymptomatic patients with mild AR and normal LV systolic function should be seen by a cardiologist annually and undergo echo every 2–3 years. Asymptomatic patients with normal systolic function, but severe AR and significant LV dilatation (end diastolic diameter >6 cm), require more frequent evaluation. These patients should be seen by a cardiologist every 6 months and undergo echo every 6–12months. Mitral stenosis The MV apparatus consists of three components: two leaflets, the fibrous annulus, and the chordae tendineae, which connect the leaflets to the papillary muscles (see Figure 1). The anterior leaflet is larger than the posterior leaflet (see Figure 2). The normal area of the MV orifice is 4–5 cm2. Symptoms of mitral stenosis (MS) develop when the orifice is <2.5 cm2and a critical stenosis occurs
