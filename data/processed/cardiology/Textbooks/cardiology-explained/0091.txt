unstable angina, the benefit of GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors is not limited to those with elevated troponin levels.) 64 Coronary artery disease Deployed stent Guidewire Contrast dye inflates balloon Atheroma Figure 8.Balloon angioplasty is used to compress atherosclerotic narrowing and dilate the artery. A balloon is directed over a guidewire to the site of stenosis where it is inflated (by contrast medium) to push open the narrowing or deploy the stent. Overall, complications from cardiac catheterization are relatively rare (totaling ~5%). They include: • contrast allergy response (very rare due to modern dyes) • local hemorrhage from puncture sites with subsequent thrombosis • false aneurysm or arteriovenous (AV) malformation • vasovagal reactions • coronary dissection • aortic dissection or ventricular perforation • air or atheroma embolism, which can occur in either the coronary or other arterial circulations with consequent ischemia or stroke • ventricular dysrhythmias, which are seen and may even cause death in the setting of left main stem disease 65 Chapter 5 THE FIRST HUMAN CORONARY ANGIOGRAM The first human coronary angiogram was, in fact, carried out by mistake by Mason Sones of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, USA, in 1958. Carrying out a standard LV angiogram, he paused –
