Cardiology

in improving the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality caused by high blood pressure (BP). If untreated, hypertension has serious consequences, including renal disease, myocardial infarction (MI), and cerebrovascular accident. However, many patients do not receive sufficiently aggressive management. Definition There is no natural cut-off between normal and high BP. As a result, many threshold values for treatment have been proposed. Table 1provides a synthesis of guidelines from the major bodies. Accurate BP measurements are complicated by several factors. For example, there is an approximately 12/7 mm Hg difference between BP measurements taken in the clinic and those taken at home – and in many patients it can be significantly more. Similarly, measurements in the clinic cannot control for a large element of random biological variation, diurnal Clinic measurement Home measurement (mm Hg) (mm Hg) Optimal control <140/85 <130/80 Mild hypertension 140–150/90–100 135–145/85–95 Moderate hypertension 150–170/100–110 145–165/95–105 Severe hypertension >170/110 >165/105 Table 1.Guidelines for threshold values between normal and high blood pressure. 77 Chapter 6 variation, and variation due to chance stress (eg, stress due to being in a traffic jam on the way to the clinic). Consequently, it is recommended that at least three readings are taken. The annual risk of
