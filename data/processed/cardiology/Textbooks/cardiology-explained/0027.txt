Cardiology

If there are no P waves, note whether the QRS complexes are wide or narrow, regular or irregular. No P waves and irregular narrow QRS complexes This is the hallmark of atrial fibrillation (see Figure 7). Sometimes the baseline appears “noisy” and sometimes it appears entirely flat. However, if there are no P waves and the QRS complexes appear at randomly irregular intervals, the diagnosis is atrial fibrillation. Sawtooth P waves A sawtooth waveform signifies atrial flutter (see Figure 8). The number of atrial contractions to one ventricular contraction should be specified. Axis The axis is the net direction of electrical activity during depolarization. It is altered by left ventricular or right ventricular hypertrophy or by bundle branch blocks. It is a very straightforward measurement that, once it has been grasped, can be calculated instantaneously: • find the QRS complex in the I and aVF leads (because these look at the heart at 0º and +90º, respectively) • determine the net positivity of the QRS wave from each of the two leads by subtracting the S wave height (the number of small squares that it crosses 22 Conquering the ECG Figure 7.ECG demonstrating atrial fibrillation.
