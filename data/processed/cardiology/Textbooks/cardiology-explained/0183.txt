Cardiology

a calcium-channel blocker (eg,verapamil) has also been found to be safe and effective in terminating AVNRT. Verapamil is particularly useful in patients with asthma, in whom adenosine is contraindicated. Symptomatic patients with frequent episodes of AVNRT can be considered for radiofrequency catheter ablation of the “slow” pathway; this can be successfully ablated in more than 95% of cases. Ventricular pre-excitation Pre-excitation is defined as an early depolarization of the ventricular myocardium that occurs prior to any conduction through the AV node. The most common condition in which this is seen is WPW syndrome, where there is an accessory AV 125 Chapter 8 (a) Pre-excitation SR VT Accessory pathway AVN AVN Delta wave Short PR interval (b) AVNRT AVN AVN Regular narrow complex No P waves Figure 14.Mechanisms of re-entrant tachycardia.

The anomalous conducting system can be located anywhere around the mitral or tricuspid rings. Most WPW patients have no evidence of structural heart disease. In the majority of cases, there is only a single accessory connection and the electrophysiological properties of the anomalous pathway differ from those of the AV
