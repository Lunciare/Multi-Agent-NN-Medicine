diagnostic of ischemia (see Figure16). It is worth noting that although ST elevation can localize the lesion (eg, anterior MI, 28 Conquering the ECG aVR V1 V4 I aVL V2 V5 II aVF V3 V6 III V1 II V5 Figure 18.ECG demonstrating a long QT interval. inferior MI), ST depression cannot. Concave upwards ST elevation in all 12 leads is diagnostic of pericarditis. T waves In a normal ECG, T waves are upright in every lead except aVR. T-wave inversion can represent current ischemia or previous infarction (see Figure 17). In combination with LVH and ST depression, it can represent “strain”. This form of LVH carries a poor prognosis. Long QT interval The QT interval should be less than half of the R–R interval. Calculation of the corrected QT (QTc) is generally not necessary andusually will have been done by the ECG machine (but beware of blindly believing any automated diagnostic system). Conditions associated with a long QT interval are outlined in Table 3 (seeFigure 18). Long QT syndrome may also be drug-induced (see Table 4, p. 32). Once this occurs, the responsible drug needs to be discontinued. 29 Chapter 3 Congenital Acquired Jervell and Lange–Nielsen syndrome Amiodarone, sotalol Romano–Ward
