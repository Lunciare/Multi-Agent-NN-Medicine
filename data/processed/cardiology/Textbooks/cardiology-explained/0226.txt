of patients remain in this compensated phase for decades. However, in time, the EF drops. Although initially this is fully reversible, soon, due to progressive dilatation and remodeling, full recovery with AVR is out of reach. A large number of studies have identified LV systolic dysfunction and end systolic dimension as the key determinants of survival in patients undergoing AVR for AR. Thus, in contrast to AS, the critical point when the benefit of AVR outweighs the risk is determined not by symptoms, but by echo-determined LV function. More specifically, AVR is indicated in: • patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV symptoms (see Chapter 7, Heart failure) and preserved LV systolic function – defined as normal EF (350% at rest) • patients with NYHA class II symptoms and preserved LV systolic function at rest, but with progressive LV dilatation, declining rest EF, or declining effort tolerance (the trend is more important than the absolute level) • patients with angina on walking or climbing stairs rapidly • asymptomatic or symptomatic patients with mild to moderate LV dysfunction at rest (EF 25%–49%) • patients undergoing open chest surgery for another reason (eg, bypass grafting) Exercise testing can
