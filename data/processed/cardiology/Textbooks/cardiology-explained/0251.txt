Neurological An acute confusional state is common in patients with infective endocarditis (IE). Cerebral emboli, which usually affect the middle cerebral artery, result in hemiplegia and sensory dysfunction. Mycotic aneurysms also affect the middle cerebral artery, where rupture may cause a subarachnoid hematoma. Mycotic aneurysms can occur several years after endocarditis has been treated. Renal Infarction causes loin pain and hematuria. Immune complex deposition may result in glomerulonephritis. OSLER’S NODES William Osler, 1909, on the eponymous Osler’s nodes: “One of the most interesting features of [endocarditis] and one to which very little attention has been paid is the occurrence of ephemeral spots of a painful nodular erythema, chiefly in the skin of the hands and feet, the nodosités cutanées éphémerès of the French… The commonest situation is near the tip of the finger, which may be slightly swollen.” 168 Infective endocarditis If any of these signs occur together with a fever, the patient should be urgently referred to a cardiologist for blood cultures and echocardiography – the level of risk will determine whether this is transesophageal echo (TEE)
