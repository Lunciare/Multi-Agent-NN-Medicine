Cardiology

One confusing aspect of electrocardiology is the terminology used to describe blocks of the fascicles (see Figure 9). The confusion arises from the fact that the right bundleis included in the list of three fascicles: • left anterior fascicle • left posterior fascicle • right bundle branch 120 Arrhythmia Bundle of His Posterior fascicular block Right Anterior fascicular block bundle block Figure 9.Fascicular block. Left anterior and left posterior fascicular block Fascicular block causes axis deviation on the ECG. Therefore, left anterior hemiblock causes left axis deviation (see Figure 10), while left posterior hemiblock causes right axis deviation (see Figure 11). Bifascicular block The term “bifascicular block” refers to a block of any two of the three fascicles. Clearly, this shouldinclude LBBB (left anterior + left posterior); however, the term is usually reserved for: • RBBB + left anterior hemiblock, ie, RBBB + left axis deviation • RBBB + left posterior hemiblock, ie, RBBB + right axis deviation (the axis is usually normal in RBBB) Bifascicular block is not in itself an indication for pacing. However, when combined with intermittent second- or third-degree block, a DDD pacemaker should be fitted. Trifascicular block Trifascicular block refers to a block of all
