IV: interventricular; LV: left ventricular. and when injected intravenously can be seen as opacification in the echo window. They are normally seen on the right side of the heart before being trapped and absorbed by the pulmonary capillaries, so have no route to the left side of the heart. The contrast created by the bubbles allows a left-to-right shunt to be seen as a jet “interrupting” the opacification of the right atrium. However, there is a theoretical risk of systemic air embolism with a right-to-left shunt. Applications Echo is the cheapest and least invasive method available for screening cardiac anatomy. Generalists most commonly request an echo to assess left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, to rule out the heart as a thromboembolic source, and to characterize murmurs. The approximate normal values for various cardiac structures are described in Table 1. 39 Chapter 4 Figures 5.E and A waves representing mitral flow in a healthy heart (E>A).
