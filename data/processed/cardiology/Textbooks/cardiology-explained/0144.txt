IV) Blood pressure is a key measurement and should be considered when deciding the rate of a nitrate infusion or whether to use b-agonists. If the systolic blood pressure drops below 100 mm Hg, consideration should be given to replacing the nitrate infusion with one containing dobutamine (2–10mg/kg/min). Although the effect of an IV diuretic can often be dramatic (probably due to an early effect on pulmonary venous dilatation), nitrates are preferred because, in addition to decreasing preload, they also decrease peripheral resistance and do not reduce cardiac output. It is also important to take the precipitating factor into account. If, for example, a patient is in atrial fibrillation, slowing the ventricular rate may be more effective than a combination of more general measures. Similarly, if a patient has suffered an MI then thrombolysis or intervention may be the key to their recovery. 98 Heart failure (a) (b) Diastolic Unassisted augmentation systole Assisted systole Assisted aortic and diastolic pressure Figure 5.(a) Insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump and (b) the corresponding arterial pressure waveform.
