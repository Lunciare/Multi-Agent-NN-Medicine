physicians in the history of medicine. He exerted a truly global influence through professorships (McGill, Johns Hopkins, and Oxford), his textbook The Principles and Practice of Medicine, and other clinical and philosophical writings. This influence is apparent not least in the sheer number of conditions that bear his name: Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia), Osler’s nodes, Osler–Libman disease (subacute bacterial endocarditis), and Osler–Libman–Sacks syndrome (systemic lupus erythematosus with endocarditis) are simply a few. But it was perhaps his overwhelming humanism and his dedication to patient-centered learning that marked him out as truly great (he once ran after an alcoholic beggar to whom he’d just given coins and added his own overcoat to the donation, saying: “You may drink yourself to death, and undoubtedly will, but I cannot let you freeze to death”). The combination of profound caring, a prolific output of creative writing and ideas, and a lifelong penchant for elaborate practical jokes has made him one of the most memorable physicians of the 20th century. Staphylococci Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis account for 20%–30% of subacute cases of IE and 50% of the acute forms. The presence of central venous catheters (feeding lines or temporary pacing lines) increases susceptibility.
