Antibiotics If, following blood cultures, the diagnosis is secure, high-dose IV antibiotics should be started immediately. It is becoming increasingly common to insert a 174 Infective endocarditis tunneled central line to facilitate several weeks of IV treatment without the need for repeated cannulation – with the pain and attendant risk of secondary infection that this incurs. Native valve endocarditis with a subacute onset is most likely to be caused by S. viridans or an enterococcal species. Treatment involves IV penicillin (2.4 g, 4 hourly) for up to 4 weeks, with gentamicin (1 mg/kg, 12 hourly) for 2 weeks. If the onset is acute, staphylococci need to be covered and treatment should include IV cloxacillin (flucloxacillin) (3g, 6hourly, in place of penicillin) with oral fusidic acid. If the patient is allergic to penicillin, other possibilities are vancomycin (1g twice daily) or teicoplanin (400 mg twice daily for 3 days, then 400 mg daily). Plasma levels of gentamicin and vancomycin need to be monitored every 48–72hours. Empirical treatment of endocarditis affecting prosthetic valves should cover streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), and Gram-negative organisms. Vancomycin or teicoplanin with gentamicin have good synergistic cover. In drug abusers, treatment for endocarditis should include
