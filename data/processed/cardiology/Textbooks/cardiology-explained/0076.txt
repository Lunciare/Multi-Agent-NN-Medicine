Early management of stable coronary disease is mostly done in the community. Risk factor and stepwise pharmacological management of stable angina are appropriate. If there is any doubt about the diagnosis, a noninvasive test for coronary disease – such as an exercise ECG – should be carried out. Exercise ECG is increasingly carried out by generalists in primary care and hospitals. Pain that is resistant to medical therapy or crescendo symptoms warrants immediate presentation to an emergency room to rule out MI. The patient should then be referred to a cardiologist for further investigation, if needed. When referring patients who have had prior intervention, try to summarize the details of previous revascularization. For example: • two-vessel disease (left anterior descending [LAD], circumflex artery) • previous left internal mammary artery (LIMA) graft to LAD, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) to right coronary artery (RCA) • previous saphenous vein graft (SVG) to circumflex artery Including this type of detail will greatly increase the usefulness of a referral letter. Specialist management Stable angina: assessment Exercise electrocardiography Exercise ECG is the mainstay test for the diagnosis of CAD. It is usually carried out on a treadmill, but bicycle exercise can also be used. The
