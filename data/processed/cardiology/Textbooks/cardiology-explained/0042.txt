axis, the parasternal short axis, and the apical view (see Figure 1). The gastric or subcostal and suprasternal views are also commonly used. 35 Chapter 4 (a) (b) (c) RV RV LV LV AV LV RV LA RA LA Figure 1. The most common two-dimensional imaging echo views. The first line illustrates the three planes (think of them as three plates of glass intersecting at 90°), the second line shows these three planes separated, and the third line shows the accompanying echo views. (a) Parasternal long axis; (b) parasternal short axis; (c) apical 4-chamber view (note, in the UK, the 4-chamber view is shown upside down). AV: aortic valve; LA: left atrium; LV: left ventricle; RA: right atrium; RV: right ventricle. M-mode imaging The M-mode echo, which provides a 1D view, is used for fine measurements. Temporal and spatial resolutions are higher because the focus is on only one of the lines from the 2D trace (see Figure 2). Doppler imaging The concept of Doppler imaging is familiar to all those who have heard the note of a police siren change as it moves past them – as the police siren travels towards you, the frequency of the wave (pitch)
