enzyme rise Cardiac rehabilitation Although the general phenomenon of MI has been recognized for about 100 years, for the first 70 years our approach to its treatment was diametrically opposite to that which we now propose. Complete immobilization for anything from 4 to 8 weeks – even to the point where patients were fed, washed, and shaved – was thought to help the heart to form a firm scar. Exercise was thought to increase the risk of ventricular aneurysm, cardiac rupture, congestive heart failure, and sudden death. How bold then were the early pioneers, such as Terry Kavanagh at the Toronto Rehab center, who in 1973 entered seven post-MI patients for the Boston Marathon (all seven finished). Not long after that, as the medical profession gained confidence in this new-found approach, the Journal of Cardiac Rehabilitation was founded by Mike Pollock and Victor Froelicher, and other pioneers were soon taking the field forward. Today, controlled trials have demonstrated that cardiac rehabilitation is not only safe and saves lives (25% reduction in mortality at 3 years), but is more cost-effective than other post-MI treatment interventions, such as thrombolytic therapy, coronary bypass surgery, and cholesterol-lowering drugs (though less cost-effective than smoking cessation
