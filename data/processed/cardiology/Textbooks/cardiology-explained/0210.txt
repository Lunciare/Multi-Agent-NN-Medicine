low-energy shock • high-energy shock The programming of AICDs is sophisticated and is carried out by telemetry (a magnet detector is placed over the unit). The energy of shock delivered by the AICD is a magnitude less than that delivered across the chest wall by an external defibrillator (internal 5–35 J, external 100–360 J). If an AICD delivers a shock, it is important to refer the patient to the nearest center where the unit can be interrogated. Electrophysiological studies Electrophysiology is a rapidly advancing field in which the potential indications currently outweigh the availability of facilities. The indications for electrophysiology are detailed in Table9. The essence of the electrophysiological test is a measurement of the intracardiac ECG: (1) during normal SR; (2) during an induced arrhythmia; and (3) following premature extrastimuli. 140 Arrhythmia Potential indications for electrophysiology Sinus node dysfunction •to evaluate the AV node or where the link between symptoms and arrhythmia is not secure AV block •suspected infranodal block (ie, pathology of the bundle of His or Purkinje fibers) •intraventricular conduction delay Frequent AVNRT •especially if frequent episodes occur despite drug treatment Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome •to characterize the accessory pathway and ablate it Unexplained syncope •after a negative tilt
