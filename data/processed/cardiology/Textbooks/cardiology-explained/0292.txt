prompt investigation for tuberculosis. Pericardial effusion and tamponade As with pleural effusion, the key defining presentation of pericardial effusion is the rate of fluid accumulation. Any cause of pericarditis can result in a significant accumulation of serous fluid, while hemopericardium (a collection of blood in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart) can be caused by trauma, type 1 dissection of the aorta, and cardiac rupture. The key feature is not the overall volume of fluid (even hundreds of milliliters can be asymptomatic if accumulated over a long enough time), but the rate of rise – as with pleural effusion, removal of even a small amount of fluid can result in significant benefit. Small, asymptomatic effusions can often be left to resorb on their own. This usually requires repeat echo at regular intervals to ensure that resorption has occurred. Larger effusions bounded by the tough parietal pericardium can compromise the low pressure right heart – this results in tamponade (see Figure 2). Examination Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency. It is associated with a characteristic jugular venous pressure (JVP). Kussmaul’s sign describes a raised JVP that rises further on inspiration, while Friedrich’s sign describes a steep x/y descent (although, in reality
