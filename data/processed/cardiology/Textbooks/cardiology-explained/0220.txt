onset of symptoms, the average survival is less than 3 years. Thus, development of symptoms is the critical point in the natural history of AS and thereafter the benefits of surgery outweigh the risk. Consequently, asymptomatic AS patients should be monitored closely. Although there is no clear consensus, most cardiologists follow-up mild AS annually (together with 5-yearly echos); moderate AS every 6 months (together with 2-yearly echos); and severe AS more frequently (together with annual echos). If a patient with AS presents with a change in symptoms, their next appointment at the cardiology clinic should be expedited. If a patient with severe AS is undergoing open chest bypass grafting for coexisting coronary artery disease (CAD), the opportunity should be taken to carry out aortic valve replacement(AVR) – regardless of whether or not AS symptoms are evident. The merit of carrying out a concomitant AVR is less clear for those with mild or moderate AS. 148 Valve disease Cardiac catheterization is only indicated in AS for two reasons: (1) to perform coronary angiography before AVR in patients with risk factors for CAD; (2) to assess the severity of AS in symptomatic patients when AVR is planned or when noninvasive tests are
