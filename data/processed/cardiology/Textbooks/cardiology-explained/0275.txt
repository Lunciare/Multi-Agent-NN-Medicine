and a fall in outflow tract velocities, development of significant conduction disturbance, and septal incoordinate relaxation. Mid- and long-term follow-up after nonsurgical septal reduction have proved promising in terms of a decrease in symptoms and maintained low outflow tract gradient. Surgery Until the last decade, the major nonmedical option for treating HCM with persistent symptoms was surgical myotomy/myectomy. In this procedure, which is also called the “Morrow procedure”, a small portion of the proximal septal myocardium is resected to widen the outflow tract. Mortality from this technique is now <2% and there is a subjective symptomatic improvement in 70% of patients. However, complications are common and for the majority of patients it results in complete LBBB or they require a permanent pacemaker for complete heart block. As a consequence, surgeons have explored other possibilities, such as 184 Cardiomyopathy History Examination Family history of premature death Auscultate the heart, both lying and Family history of heart disease at age standing, with particular attention <50 years to outflow murmurs Personal history of murmur, Assess radiofemoral delay to exclude hypertension, excessive fatigability, coarctation or syncope Recognize the stigmata Personal history of excessive or of Marfan’s syndrome progressive shortness of breath Measure systemic blood
