Table 3.Stages of hypertensive retinopathy (Keith–Wagener classification). is rarely necessary). Hypertension with LVH carries a particularly poor prognosis (the 5-year mortality is around 30%–40%) and is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. A useful tool, both for generalists and specialists, is the 24-hour ambulatory BP recording. It is particularly useful when clinic measurements show variability, with resistant hypertension, or most commonly to diagnose “white coat” hypertension. An ambulatory BP measurement (ABPM) is not required for those who are at high risk already, either because of target organ damage or cardiovascular complications. Such patients can be treated on the basis of clinic measurements. Equally, an evidence-based approach suggests that those with mild hypertension, no target organ damage, and low estimated risk may be left untreated (but followed) without ABPM. Management Many randomized controlled trials have shown that BP reduction prevents the complications of hypertension. Early trials showed a significant improvement in the risk of stroke, but little or no reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) events. Later trials, particularly those in the elderly, have also shown a reduction in CHD events, although the benefit is not as great as observational studies predicted. A summary of hypertensive treatments is shown
