return and negative intrathoracic pressure. This delays right ventricular emptying and pulmonary valve closure, at the same time that pooling of blood in the pulmonary capillary bed hastens left ventricular emptying and aortic valve closure. Reverse splitting of the second heart sound can occur in conditions where aortic valve closure is delayed, such as left bundle branch block or paced right ventricle, or where pulmonary valve closure occurs early, such as in the B form of Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome. Wide fixed splitting of the second heart sound occurs in atrial septal defect. A third heart sound may be heard soon after the second heart sound. It is thought to be due to rapid, high-volume filling of the left ventricle. As such, it is found in pathological (left ventricular failure) as well as physiological (athletic heart, pregnancy) states. A fourth heart sound may be heard just before the first sound. This is caused by atrial contraction filling a stiff left ventricle, eg, hypertensive heart or diastolic heart failure. 10 Cardiovascular examination Systole S4 S1 EC MSC A2 P2 S3 OS S2 Figure 3.Relative positions of heart sounds and added sounds in auscultation.
