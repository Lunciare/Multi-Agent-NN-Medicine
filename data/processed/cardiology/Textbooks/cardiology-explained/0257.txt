Staphylococcus epidermidis account for 20%–30% of subacute cases of IE and 50% of the acute forms. The presence of central venous catheters (feeding lines or temporary pacing lines) increases susceptibility. Acute S. aureus infection of previously normal valves has a mortality rate of 3%. This is the most common situation in IVDAs. Coagulase-negative staphylococci cause 30%–50% of prosthetic valve endocarditis. Enterococci Enterococci account for 5%–15% of IE cases. Enterococcal organisms, which include Streptococcus faecalis,have low infectivity. HACEK organisms The HACEK group of organisms – Haemophilus parainfluenza, Haemophilus aphrophilus, Actinobacillus (Haemophilus) actinomycetemcomitans, Cardiobacterium hominis, the Eikenella species, and the Kingella species – also commonly cause IE and can be difficult to diagnose. Their identification may require samples to be taken in special media. IE is also caused by other, less common organisms. Candida, Aspergillus, Histoplasma, and Brucellainfections are rare, but are found, in particular, in IVDAs, alcoholics, and patients with prosthetic heart valves. Coxiella burnetii(the causative agent of Q fever) can also cause a subacute infection. 171 Chapter 10 Figure 2.Mitral valve vegetation. Pathogenesis Endocarditis infection occurs along the edges of the heart valves. The lesions, called vegetations, are masses composed of fibrin, platelets, and infecting organisms, held together by agglutinating
