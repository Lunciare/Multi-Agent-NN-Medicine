brought in immediately. Treatment then depends on the diagnosis (see Table 1). Clinical examination can help, whether an ECG is available or not. The key thing to remember is that there are few components in the electrical “wiring” of the heart (see Figure 1) and the pulse can only be fast or slow, regular or irregular. If an ECG is available, is the QRS complex narrow or broad? Broad (>0.12 seconds) is more likely to be ventricular tachycardia (VT) and will generally be more concerning than narrow, which suggests a high depolarization site and is likely to be supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Bradycardia Bradycardia is defined as heart rate <60 bpm, regardless of the cause. However, this is not a particularly helpful definition as it is well known that elite athletes can have “normal” heart rates as low as 30 bpm. In general, bradycardia needs 111 Chapter 8 Pulse Most likely diagnosis ECG to rule out Regular and slow Sinus rhythm Complete heart block (~60bpm) Junctional rhythm Regular and fast Atrial flutter with 2:1 AV block Ventricular tachycardia (~150bpm) Regular and fast AV node re-entrant tachycardia Ventricular tachycardia (>150bpm) Irregular and fast Atrial fibrillation with rapid Ventricular tachycardia ventricular response Irregular
