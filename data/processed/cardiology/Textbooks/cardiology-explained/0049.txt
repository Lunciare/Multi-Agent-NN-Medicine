ischemic region where the ECG cannot; in the latter, it offers some measure of the extent of the infarct and a screen for complications, such as ventricular septal defect (VSD). Valve assessment Echo is the tool of choice for the assessment of valvular abnormalities. Aortic stenosis The etiology of aortic stenosis (AS) can be confirmed by the visualization of either a bicuspid valve or calcification. The severity of the stenosis can be estimated by measuring high-velocity flow across the valve by Doppler. This can be converted to an estimation of the pressure drop. In addition, the effective orifice area can be measured (see Table 2). Aortic regurgitation CFM is the most useful technique for detecting and quantifying the degree of regurgitation. The width of the regurgitant jet and of the slope of the decline in pressure gradient between the left ventricle and the aorta (which is reduced already compared with normal) are measured. Mitral stenosis With mitral stenosis (MS), as with AS, calcified, immobile MV leaflets can be demonstrated with 2D and M-mode echo. Anterior motion of the posterior MV leaflet in diastole (caused by commissural fusion) is characteristic in MS. Doppler demonstrates increased flow velocity and can be used
