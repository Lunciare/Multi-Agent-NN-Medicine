image- enhancing contrast dye) to compress the atheroma and dilate the artery (see Figure 8). Until recently, this was the intervention of choice. However, balloon angioplasty has a restenosis rate of 30% over 6 months and a high rate of coronary artery dissection. Consequently, the use of coronary artery stents (see Figure 8), which have lower rates of restenosis and artery dissection, has become common practice. These are deployed using a balloon. Most recent work has focussed on drug-eluting stents (which elute anti-inflammatory or anti-proliferative agents), which seem dramatically to reduce the incidence of restenosis. PIONEERS In 1929, Werner Forssmann – a German cardiologist – went against the express advice of his boss and, with the help of a nurse, inserted a catheter through an arm vein into his own heart. This was the first time a human heart had ever been catheterized. He saw the successful catheterization images on a fluoroscope screen – only by using a mirror. A pioneer of cardiology, he published his paper in Klinische Wochenschrift in 1929 and, although he catheterized only one patient’s heart, he went on to catheterize his own heart another eight times. 63 Chapter 5 Contrast flow TIMI grade Prompt anterograde
