rising Low gradient upstroke Aortic stenosis Waterhammer, Steep up and down stroke Aortic regurgitation, collapsing (lift arm so that wrist is patent ductus arteriosus above heart height) Bisferiens A double-peaked pulse – the Aortic regurgitation, second peak can be smaller, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy larger, or the same size as the first Pulsus paradoxus An exaggerated fall in pulse Cardiac tamponade, volume on inspiration acute asthma (>10 mm Hg on sphygmomanometry) Bounding Large volume Anemia, hepatic failure, type 2 respiratory failure (high CO) 2 Pulsus alternans Alternating large and small Bigeminy volume pulses Table 4.Abnormal pulses. Blood pressure This is described in Chapter 6, Hypertension. Jugular venous pressure Of all the elements of clinical examination, the jugular venous pressure (JVP) is the most mysterious. It is highly esoteric, and whilst some people wax lyrical about the steepness of the “y” descent, others will feel grateful to be convinced they see it at all. Two things are very clear: (1) the JVP is a very useful clinical marker in many situations, and (2) the exact height of the JVP is a poor guide to central venous pressure. Taken together, this suggests that noting whether the JVP is “up” or “down” is good practice
