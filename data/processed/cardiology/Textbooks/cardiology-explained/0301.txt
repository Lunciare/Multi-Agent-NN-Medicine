and with more severe symptoms. The classic sign of ASD is wide, fixed splitting of the second heart sound, together with a systolic murmur due to high flow across the pulmonary valve (see Table 1). Primum ASD may be accompanied by mitral regurgitation. ECG might indicate RBBB and either RVH and right axis deviation (secundum) or left axis deviation (primum) (see Table 1). CXR may show cardiomegaly with a prominent pulmonary trunk. Management ASDs that are large enough to give clear physical signs should be closed. Closure of an ostium secundum defect is relatively easy and carries a low mortality rate. Correction of an ostium primum defect, with its associated anomalies, is more difficult and carries a higher mortality rate. More recently, percutaneous device closure of small and moderate size ASDs has been possible. In this procedure, a “butterfly” device (eg, the Clamshell occluder, the Starflex occluder, or the Amplatzer occluder) is manipulated noninvasively into the heart and “opened”, whereupon it grasps the defect on either side and closes it (see Figures 5 and6). Primum ASD requires prophylaxis for infective endocarditis, while secundum ASD doesnot. Eisenmenger syndrome This is the name given to reversal in the direction of a cardiac
