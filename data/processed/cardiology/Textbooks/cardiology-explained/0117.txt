of cases of primary hyperaldosteronism. Raised calcium levels suggest possible hyperparathyroidism. If the symptoms suggest a thyroid problem, thyroid function should be tested. A low threshold should be adopted for the following: • renal ultrasound • urine microscopy (for casts and cells – glomerulonephritis) • urine samples for testing: – catecholamine metabolites (three samples, one every 24 hours, required in acid bottles) – urinary free cortisol (one sample in a plain bottle – this can also be used for glomerular filtration rate and 24-hour protein tests) Once hypertension has caused end-organ damage, the risks associated with any given level of BP are higher. Evidence of end-organ damage should therefore be sought in all patients. Dip-stick urinalysis, tests for urea and electrolytes, and a renal ultrasound can reveal renal insufficiency. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) can be readily detected by electrocardiography or echocardiography (a chest x-ray 80 Hypertension Stage Signs I Arteriolar narrowing and tortuosity Increased light reflex “Silver wiring” II Arteriovenous nipping III Cotton-wool “exudates” Flame and blot hemorrhages IV Papilledema Table 3.Stages of hypertensive retinopathy (Keith–Wagener classification). is rarely necessary). Hypertension with LVH carries a particularly poor prognosis (the 5-year mortality is around 30%–40%) and is a powerful predictor of
