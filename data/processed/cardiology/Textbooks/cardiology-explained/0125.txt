doxazosin and prazosin) are becoming more widely 1 used in the treatment of hypertension. They have a good side-effect profile (palpitations and occasional postural hypotension). In addition, they are reported to have beneficial effects on lipid profile and insulin resistance, and lack the negative effects on sexual potency of other antihypertensives, which is a particular advantage for diabetics. They work to reduce total peripheral resistance by blocking the sympathetic activation of a -receptors on resistance vessels. 1 Centrally acting sympathomimetics Clonidine and a-methyldopa, centrally acting a -adrenoceptor agonists, were once 2 popular choices, but are now less widely initiated outside specialist scenarios such as pre-eclampsia. They carry a risk of rebound hypertension on withdrawal. Other vasodilators Other vasodilators, such as hydralazine and the very potent minoxidil, are mostly used in resistant hypertension when standard agents fail. Use of the latter is generally restricted by unpleasant side effects such as hypertrichosis. Imidazoline type 1 receptor agonists The identification of imidazoline receptors has revealed that the effects of older agents on the central nervous system reflect a relatively nonspecific central site of action mediated primarily through a-adrenoceptor agonism (see Figure 2). It seems that 2 some of the adverse effects of these
