the side branches or divisions of a vessel. As such, primary PTCA is the procedure of choice for patients within 12hours of the onset of MI symptoms. Current evidence suggests that patients of less than 75 years with cardiogenic shock (occurring within 36 hours of MI) benefit most from primary PTCA (within 18 hours of onset of shock) in an appropriate center with experienced personnel. In cases of poor LV function, intra-aortic balloon pumping (see Chapter 7, Heart failure) is useful in the setting of proximal LAD or mainstem stenting. Thrombolysis Thrombolysis is given as an infusion of (typically) streptokinase or tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) over 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the protocol. Aspirin and (intravenous) b-blocker should also be given acutely. Thrombolysis is beneficial up to 12 hours after the onset of pain, but may be given up to 24 hours afterwards in the context of continuing pain or a deteriorating condition. The choice of thrombolytic agent is controversial. tPA and similar recombinant agents are still from 5-to 7-times more expensive than streptokinase and thus only tend to be used in the following situations: • where streptokinase has been administered previously • where recent proven streptococcal throat
