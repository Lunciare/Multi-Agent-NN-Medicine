S4 S1 EC MSC A2 P2 S3 OS S2 Figure 3.Relative positions of heart sounds and added sounds in auscultation. Sounds in red are high pitched. A2: aortic component of second heart sound; EC: ejection click; MSC: mid systolic click; OS: opening snap; P2: pulmonary component of second heart sound; S1–S4: heart sounds 1–4. Murmurs When you have considered these heart sound variations, move on to consider the gaps between the heart sounds. If you hear a murmur, first establish whether it occurs in systole or diastole (time against the carotid pulse if necessary). Then determine its length and, if short, its exact position (early, mid, or late; systole or diastole) (see Figure 3). Added sounds An opening snap occurring after the second heart sound represents a diseased mitral valve opening to a stenotic position. An ejection click soon after the first heart sound occurs in aortic stenosis and pulmonary stenosis. A mid systolic click is heard in mitral valve prolapse. After listening to the heart Listen to the base of the lungs for the fine inspiratory crackles of pulmonary edema. If you suspect right-sided cardiac pathology, palpate the liver, which will be enlarged, congested, and possibly pulsatile in cases
