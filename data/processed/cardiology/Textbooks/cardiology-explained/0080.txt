ACC/AHA/ACP-ASIM Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Chronic Stable Angina: Executive Summary and Recommendations. Circulation1999;99:2829–48). A diagnostic algorithm for CAD is outlined in Figure 7. Most guidelines suggest the use of an alternative test if the preprobability is low. If the preprobability is high, exercise testing adds little in the way of diagnosis, but is useful for risk stratification. The primary role
