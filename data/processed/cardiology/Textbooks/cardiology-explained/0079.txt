low sensitivity (<50%) but high specificity (>90%) – ie, it is very good at ruling disease in, but not good at ruling it out • the meaning of the test results is significantly affected by the pretest probability of disease (see Table 5). For example, exercise-induced ST depression in a young woman with no risk factors is likely to be a false positive • incorporating clinical and demographic information into the basic test result by calculating diagnostic “scores” can increase the sensitivity and specificity to >90% (see Figure 6) • patients without a clear diagnosis from the exercise tolerance test should have another noninvasive test 58 Coronary artery disease Contraindications to Reasons for stopping exercise testing an exercise test Unstable angina Development of anginal symptoms Left main stem disease Fall >15 mm Hg or failure to Acute myocarditis or pericarditis increase systolic blood pressure Untreated congestive cardiac failure Arrhythmia development – ventricular in particular Evidence of pyrexial or “flu”-like illnesses An ST-segment depression of >2 mm in chest leads or >1 mm in limb leads Severe aortic stenosis or HCM with marked outflow obstruction Dissecting aneurysm Adults with complete heart block Untreated severe hypertension LBBB (the test is nondiagnostic) Table
