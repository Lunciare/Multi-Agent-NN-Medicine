Dissection is classified according to whether it includes the ascending aorta (typeA) or not (type B) (see Figure 3). Type A dissection is a surgical emergency because of the high risk of proximal extension, rupture, and sudden death. If a type A dissection is confirmed by CT or MRI, the patient should be operated on immediately. The highly specialized repair operation can involve replacement of the aortic root with a vascular graft, reimplantation of the coronary arteries, and resuspension of the aortic valve. In some cases it may be necesssary to replace the valve. In contrast, type B dissection
