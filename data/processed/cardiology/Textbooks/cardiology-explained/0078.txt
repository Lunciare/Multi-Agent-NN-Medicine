is achieved. (b)The modified Bruce exercise protocol is less intense to start with and is used to assess frailer patients, such as the elderly or those who have suffered a myocardial infarction. tests focus predominantly on the ST segment, which must fall more than 1 mm from rest and be horizontal or downsloping to be significant. ST depression does not localize ischemia so it cannot reveal anything about a suspected coronary lesion, but it does enable a classification of mild, intermediate, or severe CAD to be made. The exercise test is also useful for recording other variables, ie, work capacity; maximum heart rate and chronotropic incompetence; blood pressure rise and recovery; and heart rate recovery. Work capacity (presumably reflecting left ventricular [LV] function) and heart rate recovery are very strong prognostic indicators for CAD. Contraindications to exercise testing and reasons for stopping an exercise test are outlined in Table 4. It is important to appreciate where the value of the exercise test lies: • exercise ECG on its own has low sensitivity (<50%) but high specificity (>90%) – ie, it is very good at ruling disease in, but not good at ruling it out • the meaning of the test
