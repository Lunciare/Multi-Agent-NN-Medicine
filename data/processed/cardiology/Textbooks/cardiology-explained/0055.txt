MI: myocardial infarction. The establishment of these pathophysiological origins of CAD, together with the identification of improved clinical markers for ischemia and necrosis, has led to the proposal of a new (somewhat controversial) definition for acute MI: a rise and fall in troponin or the creatine kinase myocardial band fraction (CK-MB) (see “Markers of myocardial damage” section), plus at least one of the following: • ischemic symptoms • development of pathological Q waves on the electrocardiogram (ECG) • ST-segment elevation or depression on the ECG • coronary artery intervention (eg, angioplasty) 46 Coronary artery disease ANGINA PECTORIS William Heberden defined angina pectoris in 1768 and provided a clear description of the familiar pain. However, it was Edward Jenner and Caleb Parry who linked this “disorder of the breast” with the “hardening” of the arteries that had been described by Giovanni Morgagni 7 years earlier. Assessment History and examination History-taking is the most valuable technique for differentiating between the many causes of chest discomfort. The classic symptoms of angina are well known: a sensation of a constriction of
