in fingertips Infective endocarditis Table 3.Peripheral signs associated with infective endocarditis. Checking both radials simultaneously is important in all cases of chest pain as a gross screening test for aortic dissection. Adding radiofemoral delay (or radiofemoral difference in volume) may alert you to coarctation as a rare cause of hypertension. Peripheral pulses should also be documented, as peripheral vascular disease is an important predictor of coronary artery disease: • femoral – feel at the midinguinal point (midway between the symphysis pubis and the anterior superior iliac spine, just inferior to the inguinal ligament) • popliteal – feel deep in the center of the popliteal fossa with the patient lying on their back with their knees bent • posterior tibial – feel behind the medial malleolus • dorsalis pedis – feel over the second metatarsal bone just lateral to the extensor hallucis tendon 6 Cardiovascular examination Type of pulse Pulse characteristics Most likely cause Regularly irregular – 2nd-degree heart block, ventricular bigeminy Irregularly irregular – Atrial fibrillation, frequent ventricular ectopics Slow rising Low gradient upstroke Aortic stenosis Waterhammer, Steep up and down stroke Aortic regurgitation, collapsing (lift arm so that wrist is patent ductus arteriosus above heart height) Bisferiens A double-peaked
