St Mary’s Medical School, London, published the first human electrocardiogram in the British Medical Journalin 1888. It was recorded from Thomas Goswell, a technician in the laboratory, using a capillary electrometer. After that, Waller used a more available subject for his demonstrations – his dog Jimmy, who would patiently stand with his paws in glass jars of saline.

Depolarization of the heart The route that the depolarization wave takes across the heart is outlined in Figure 3. The sinoatrial node (SAN) is the heart’s pacemaker. From the SAN, the wave of depolarization spreads across the atria to the atrioventricular node (AVN). The impulse is delayed briefly at the AVN and atrial contraction is completed. The wave of depolarization then proceeds rapidly to the bundle of His where it splits into two pathways and travels along the right and left bundle branches. The impulse travels the length of the bundles along the interventricular
