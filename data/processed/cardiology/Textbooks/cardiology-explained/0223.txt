with the heartbeat • Duroziez’s sign – caused by retrograde diastolic flow in the femoral artery. Place the stethoscope on the femoral pulse and occlude the artery distally. The turbulent flow will be picked up as a “to-and-fro” murmur 149 Chapter 9 • Quincke’s sign – capillary pulsation in the nail beds that is visible on applying gentle pressure to induce a degree of whitening • Traube’s sign – a “pistol-shot” sound heard over the femoral pulse • Müller’s sign – pulsation of the uvula An early diastolic murmur is heard at the left lower sternal edge when the patient is sitting forward and holding his or her breath in expiration. There could also be a coexistent aortic systolic flow murmur, caused by the large stroke volume (rather than reflecting organic AS). There may be a mid diastolic murmur at the apex (Austin Flint murmur) caused by the regurgitant aortic jet vibrating the anterior mitral valve (MV) leaflet. Acute aortic regurgitation Acute AR is one hallmark of aortic dissection and is a medical emergency in its own right. A large regurgitant volume is suddenly imposed on an LV of normal size that has not had time to accommodate to the
