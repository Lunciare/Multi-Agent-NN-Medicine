Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are currently reserved for those patients with an ACE cough. Guidelines for starting ACEIs are outlined in Table 6. Beta-blockers Much of the early work on b-blockers used carvedilol – a nonselective b-blocker, a-antagonist, and antioxidant. However, although its significant effect appeared to result from b-blockade resulting in many different b-blocking agents being used, recent trials have suggested there may be effects over and above that of b-blockade. Beneficial effects of b-blockade include a reduction in heart rate (which increases 104 Heart failure Digoxin Na+ Ca2+ – Out In K+ Na+ Na+ Ca2+ Figure 7.Mechanism of action of digoxin. Digoxin inhibits Na+/K+ATPase. As a consequence of an increased intercellular Na+concentration, Ca2+extrusion (via Na+/Ca2+ exchange) is reduced. The result is an increase in cellular Ca2+. myocardial perfusion), regression of LVH (probably related to inhibition of the deleterious effects of excess catecholamines), and a reduction in sudden death (probably related to a reduction in ventricular fibrillation – 50% of heart failure deaths are due to arrhythmia). Digoxin Digoxin has perhaps the
