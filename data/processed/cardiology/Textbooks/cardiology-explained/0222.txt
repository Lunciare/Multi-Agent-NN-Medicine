of medical therapy and balloon valvotomy, AVR should be considered for all elderly patients with symptomatic AS. However, the decision as to whether to carry out AVR is rarely straightforward and must take into account the risks as viewed by both the surgeon and the patient. Comorbidity in the form of LVH or CAD greatly increases the risk associated with surgery. In addition, specific valve problems, such as heavy calcification and narrow LV outflow tract or annulus, make the procedure more complex. The decision is highly individual. Aortic regurgitation AR is associated with classic clinical signs (see Table 2): • waterhammer (collapsing) pulse – detected by comparing the character of the radial pulse at the level of the heart with its character on elevation of the arm (use several fingers). Elevation accentuates the steep rise-and-fall character of this pulse, which seems to slap faster and harder against the fingers • Corrigan’s sign – visible arterial pulsation in the neck • de Musset’s sign – nodding of the head in time with the heartbeat • Duroziez’s sign – caused by retrograde diastolic flow in the femoral artery. Place the stethoscope on the femoral pulse and occlude the artery distally. The turbulent
