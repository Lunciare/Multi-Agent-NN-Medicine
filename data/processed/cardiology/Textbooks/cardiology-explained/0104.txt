receptors), enzymes that degrade the cap (matrix metalloproteinases), and protective species (such as nitric oxide). With inflammation a central component of our current appreciation of atherosclerosis, there is much interest in circulating markers (such as C-reactive protein) and pharmaceutical interventions that decrease inflammation (aspirin and statins). Arrhythmia Reperfusion arrhythmias are common in the first 2 hours following thrombolysis. In addition to ensuring that plasma potassium is above 4.5, intravenous amiodarone and therapeutic-dose magnesium are indicated for sustained ventricular tachycardia or in ventricular fibrillation as adjuncts to defibrillation. Amiodarone is usually given via a central line, but can also be administered via a large antecubital cannula, although the latter has a slightly higher risk of local necrosis. Arrhythmias occurring more than 48 hours after an acute MI are associated with a worse prognosis and should be investigated further by coronary angiography to rule out hemodynamically relevant coronary stenoses, and electrophysiological studies to rule out scar-tissue substrate. Other therapy Glycemic control should be optimized in all diabetic patients, preferably with the use of sliding-scale insulin. Oral inotropes should be avoided since almost all randomized trials have shown an increased mortality over placebo. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and b-blockers are given within the first
