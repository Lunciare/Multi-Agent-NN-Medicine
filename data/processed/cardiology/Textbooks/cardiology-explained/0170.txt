In most cases, it will be necessary to refer the patient for additional testing (see Figure 2). Additional testing may include the following. • Documentation of a symptomatic arrhythmia may be achieved by Holter monitoring. However, if syncope is infrequent, event-recorder monitoring may be more helpful. These devices allow patients to turn the device on when the episode begins (or ends, facilitated by the use of a buffer), and thus record over a much greater period of time. • An echocardiogram should be used to detect major structural abnormalities potentially associated with syncope (aortic stenosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ischemia). Carotid sinus massage should be performed if bruits are absent. • Before invasive electrophysiological testing, coronary artery disease should be excluded or treated. Electrophysiological testing is indicated whenever an arrhythmia is considered as a probable cause
