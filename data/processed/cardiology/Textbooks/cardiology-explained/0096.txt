Troponin I and T are sensitive and specific markers (unlike troponin C). Their blood level clearly relates to risk and thus they represent a powerful tool for risk stratification Creatine kinasea 3–4 h 10–24 h 2–4 d CK-MB is the main cardiac isoenzyme Lactate 10 h 24–72 h 14 d Myocardium mainly dehydrogenase has LDH1 Myoglobin 1–2 h 4–8 h 24 h Convenient early marker due to availability of assay, but not cardiac specific Heart fatty-acid 1.5 h 5–10 h 24 h Undergoing evaluation binding proteins Table 7.Timescales for the variation in levels of markers for myocardial damage. CK-MB: creatine kinase myocardial band fraction; LDH1: lactate dehydrogenase 1. aCreatine kinase has three isoenzymes, of which CK-MB is the most cardiac specific. However, other organs also possess this enzyme in small quantities. It has been suggested that a CK-MB/CK ratio of over 2.5 is very specific for myocardial infarction in the context of chest pain. However, even this is inaccurate in situations of significant acute or chronic skeletal injury, where CK levels are also high. Acute coronary syndromes: assessment Risk assessment is the key to in-hospital management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Patients with ST elevation need to be considered immediately
