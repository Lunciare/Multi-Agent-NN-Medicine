as there are more variables; although the pacing spikes are usually straightforward to recognize. It is important to remember that the paced QRS complex will be in an LBBB pattern because the wave of depolarization begins where the lead is placed in the RV. Doctor, I have a pacemaker, what should I avoid? This is a common question that patients ask. In general, patients should live life as normal. They should avoid magnetic resonance imaging studies, and care should be taken with the following: • electrocautery during surgery – this can cause sensing problems • therapeutic radiation • cardioversion/defibrillation – this should be carried out using the lowest effective energy with the paddles in the anterior–posterior positions on the body of the patient • mobile phones – these should not be placed in a shirt pocket next to the pacemaker • car batteries – batteries can produce large magnetic fields. Again, this is only a problem if the person is leaning over and the pacemaker comes close to the battery • high-voltage cables Most manufacturers supply each pacemaker recipient with a wallet-sized emergency card for identification as the bearer of an implanted device. This card should include important information about
