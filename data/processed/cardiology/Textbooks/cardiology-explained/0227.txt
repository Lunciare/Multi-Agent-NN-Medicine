Cardiology

• asymptomatic or symptomatic patients with mild to moderate LV dysfunction at rest (EF 25%–49%) • patients undergoing open chest surgery for another reason (eg, bypass grafting) Exercise testing can be useful in AR if the patient is sedentary or has equivocal symptoms. It assesses functional capacity and the hemodynamic effects of exercise. Radionuclide ventriculography should be used if the echo window is poor. Cardiac catheterization is only required in patients at risk of CAD prior to AVR or where other tests are equivocal. 151 Chapter 9 Asymptomatic patients with no LV dysfunction should be encouraged to participate in all forms of normal daily activity, including exercise (although lifting weights should be avoided). Vasodilator therapy can, in theory, retard the natural history of chronic AR by reducing the regurgitant volume. However, very few studies have actually examined the effect of this treatment on the long-term outcome. Indications for vasodilator therapy (generally using long-acting nifedipine) are: • long-term therapy in patients with severe regurgitation who have symptoms and/or LV dysfunction, when surgery is not recommended • long-term therapy in asymptomatic patients with severe regurgitation who have LV dilatation, but normal systolic function • long-term therapy in asymptomatic patients with hypertension and
