rate and blood pressure) (see Chapter 6, Hypertension). 54 Coronary artery disease Potassium-channel openers Potassium-channel openers, such as nicorandil, are a new class of agents for the treatment of angina. They exert both direct action on cardiac mitochondria and a nitrate-like effect. These are not yet available in the US. Lipid-lowering agents Lipids are insoluble in water. Hence, they are transported around the body as lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are made up of cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and protein. The major classes of lipoproteins (which vary in density, size, and triglyceride/cholesterol ratio) are: • chylomicrons (the largest and least dense) • very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) • low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) • HDLs Lipids originate from two sources: endogenous lipids, synthesized in the liver, and exogenous lipids, ingested and processed in the intestine (see Figure 4). Dietary cholesterol and triglycerides are packaged into chylomicrons in the intestine, before passing into the bloodstream via lymphatics. Chylomicrons are broken down by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) in the capillaries of muscle and adipose tissue to fatty acids, which then enter the cells. The chylomicron remnants, which have lost much of their triglyceride content, are taken up by the liver for disposal. The liver synthesizes triglycerides and cholesterol, and packages
