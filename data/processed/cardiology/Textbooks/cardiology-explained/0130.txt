dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers. Ethnic groups Afro-Caribbean blacks have a particularly high prevalence of hypertension and severe complications. Their presentation is unusual in that the renin–angiotensin system is often suppressed. As a result, b-blockers and ACEIs are unlikely to be successful as monotherapy in these patients. Diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, and salt restriction are all effective. Diabetics Hypertension is common in diabetics and plays a major role in the vascular complications of the disease. Recent studies have suggested there is more to gain from controlling hypertension in diabetics than there is in achieving normoglycemia. For this reason, particularly aggressive BP-lowering treatment is warranted in these patients. ACEIs, preferably combined with a thiazide diuretic, are the treatment of choice. Previous avoidance of b-blockers or thiazide diuretics because of possible worsening of glycemic control needs to be reassessed in light of this information. Most recent studies show that both groups of drugs can be safely administered in diabetics. Pregnancy Hypertension occurs in up to 10% of pregnancies. The key distinction is between chronic hypertension in a pregnant woman and pregnancy-induced hypertension (pre-eclampsia) – defined as a rise in BP of >30/15 mm Hg from early pregnancy. Little is known about which agents are truly
