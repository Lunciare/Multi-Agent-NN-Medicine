of the left ventricle). It is expressed as an angle and can be estimated quite easily (normal is 0º–120º) 23 Chapter 3 HUMAN RESUSCITATION The first electrical resuscitation of a human took place (almost certainly) in 1872. The resuscitation of a drowned girl with electricity is described by Guillaume Benjamin Amand Duchenne de Boulogne, a pioneering neurophysiologist, in the third edition of his textbook on the medical uses of electricity. Although it is sometimes described as the first artificial pacing, the stimulation was of the phrenic nerve and not the myocardium. ECG abnormalities This section discusses the most important and most frequently encountered ECG abnormalities. Normal variations • Small Q waves and inverted T waves in lead III often disappear on deep inspiration. Occasional septal Q waves can be seen in other leads. • ST elevation following an S wave (“high take off”) is common in leads V2–V4 and is quite normal. Differentiating this from pathological ST elevation can be difficult and relies on the patient’s history and the availability of a previous ECG. These “repolarization abnormalities” are more common in the young and in athletes. • T-wave inversion is common in Afro-Caribbean blacks. • U waves – small extra
