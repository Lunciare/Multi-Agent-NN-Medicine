few degenerative diseases that produce continuous murmurs • cyanosis, clubbing – unless there is coexistent lung disease, a patient with a murmur and cyanosis should be referred for echocardiography • right bundle branch block (RBBB) – this occurs in 1% of the middle-aged population without disease. When combined with a murmur, the patient should be referred for echocardiography In most cases, suspicion of congenital heart disease leads to a cardiology referral. However, an awareness of the possible diagnoses will help your referral. Ventricular septal defect Ventricular septal defect (VSD) (see Figures 2 and 3) is the most common congenital heart defect. Symptoms depend on the size of the defect and the age of the patient. Small VSDs are usually asymptomatic and compatible with a normal life (in fact, about 40% close spontaneously in early childhood). Large VSDs cause cardiac failure in the second or third month after birth. If a large shunt does not produce symptoms during infancy, there is usually little disturbance until late adolescence or early adult life when the patient develops high pulmonary vascular resistance, breathlessness, fatigue, and cyanosis. There is progression to effort syncope, recurrent hemoptysis, and heart failure. 203 Chapter 14 35 30 25 20
