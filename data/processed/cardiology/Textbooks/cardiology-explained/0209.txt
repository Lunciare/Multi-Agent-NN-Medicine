at present these include VF or VT cardiac arrest without a reversible cause; spontaneous sustained VT; syncope of undetermined origin with hemodynamically significant sustained VT; and nonsustained VT with prior MI or LV dysfunction. A recent study suggested that all post-MI patients with an EF <30% should receive an ACD. An AICD is expensive – approximately the same cost as bypass grafting – but the device is multifunctional. It is capable of bradycardia and tachyarrhythmia detection, overdrive pacing or defibrillation, and event memory (ie, it can “play back” the intracardiac trace from a few minutes before the event, which is extremely useful diagnostically). The AICD contains a device program for termination of VT and this highlights its versatility. It can initiate: • burst pacing – a short burst of paced beats delivered at approximately 90% of the rate of the VT • ramp pacing – a short burst of paced beats at a rate increasing up to 90% of the rate of the VT (to try to achieve capture) • low-energy shock • high-energy shock The programming of AICDs is sophisticated and is carried out by telemetry (a magnet detector is placed over the unit). The energy of shock delivered
