exercise can be as effective as b-blockade in the management of stable angina. It has been associated with increased plaque stability and even slight plaque shrinkage. It is recommended that patients exercise for 30–45minutes per day, 4–5times a week. Estimating risk Formal risk estimation is aided by a standard set of tables that were developed using epidemiological data gathered over many years (see Figures 2 and 3). These tables are based on: • gender • age • presence of diabetes • smoking • systolic blood pressure • total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) ratio Investigations Electrocardiogram The ECG is a vital tool for assessing patients in both stable and emergency situations. Nevertheless, generalists in primary care do not always have ready access to it. Any patient presenting with clear cardiac chest pain should undergo an ECG immediately or as soon as possible (preferably even before a history is taken) to identify whether they are at high risk, ie, ST segment change or new left bundle branch block (LBBB). This facilitates prompt referral when necessary and, for thrombolysis, a door-to-needle time of less than 30 minutes. However, the ECG 53 Chapter 5 is not absolute– ST-segment elevation is present in only
