Cardiology

cardiac structures are described in Table 1. 39 Chapter 4 Figures 5.E and A waves representing mitral flow in a healthy heart (E>A). Systolic dysfunction LV systolic dysfunction is assessed using the ejection fraction (the percentage of the end diastolic volume ejected during systole). In most cases, this is estimated by eye from all the available echo views. A normal ejection fraction is 50%–80%, but values as low as 5% are compatible with life (end-stage heart failure). The E/A ratio When flow across the MV is assessed with PW Doppler, two waves are characteristically seen. These represent passive filling of the ventricle (early [E] wave) and active filling with atrial systole (atrial [A] wave). Classically, the E-wave velocity is slightly greater than that of the A wave (see Figure 5). However, in conditions that limit the compliance of the LV, two abnormalities are possible: • reversal – in which the A wave is greater than the E wave. This indicates slow filling caused by older age, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), or diastolic dysfunction • exaggeration of normal – a tall, thin E wave with a small or absent A wave. This indicates restrictive cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, or infiltrative cardiac
