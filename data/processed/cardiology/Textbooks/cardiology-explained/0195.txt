the initial stages and monthly thereafter. Patients over the age of 75years who are considered at high risk for bleeding complications can be targeted to a lower INR of 2. In patients with contraindications to full anticoagulation, a daily dose of 300mg aspirin can be used as an alternative to warfarin. • If elective cardioversion is to be attempted, patients should be anticoagulated for 4 weeks with warfarin (aim for an INR of 2–3.5) and potassium levels should be kept in the upper normal range (>4.2 mmol) as this increases the chance of success of the cardioversion. Cardioversion can be electrical or chemical. If DC cardioversion is used, the patient receives a general anesthetic with a short-acting induction agent (usually propofol) and then receives shocks (synchronized to the R waves) of increasing energy: 100J, 200J, 360J, and 360Jusing paddles on the anterior and posterior chest (the patient lies on their side). Chemical cardioversion is also possible using flecainide. In the event of successful cardioversion, patients should continue warfarin for at least 4 weeks. This is because the thromboembolic risk relates to “stunned” atria that do not resume normal mechanical function during this time. 133 Chapter 8 FAMOUS SCOTS The first
