valve vegetation. Pathogenesis Endocarditis infection occurs along the edges of the heart valves. The lesions, called vegetations, are masses composed of fibrin, platelets, and infecting organisms, held together by agglutinating antibodies produced by the bacteria. As inflammation continues, ulceration may result in erosion or perforation of the valve cusps, leading to valvular incompetence, damage to the conduction pathway (if in the septal area), or rupture of a sinus of Valsalva (if in the aortic area). Although endocarditis can affect native and prosthetic valves, infection seldom affects a previously normal heart – the majority (60%) of IE patients have a predisposing cardiac condition. Vegetations usually affect the left side of the heart, with the most common underlying lesions being mitral valve prolapse and degenerative mitral and aortic regurgitation (see Figure 2). Rheumatic disease is a risk factor for the development of endocarditis. Other predisposing cardiac lesions include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with associated mitral reflux, subaortic stenosis, and ventricular aneurysm. There are also congenital lesions that predispose adults to endocarditis: these include ventricular septal defect (VSD), bicuspid aortic valve, and coarctation of the aorta. Vegetations occur when a high-pressure jet enters a low-pressure cavity through a narrow orifice. This explains why endocarditis complicates
