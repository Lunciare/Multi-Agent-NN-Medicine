years ago. It comprises three waves, which have been named P, QRS (a wave complex), and T (see Figure4). P wave The P wave is a small deflection wave that represents atrial depolarization. PR interval The PR interval is the time between the first deflection of the P wave and the first deflection of the QRS complex. 19 Chapter 3 (a) LA V6 RA LV RV V5 V1 V2 V3 V4 (b) V1 V4–V6 Figure 5. (a) A horizontal section through the chest showing the orientation of the chest leads with respect to the chambers of the heart. (b) In lead V1, depolarization of the interventricular septum occurs towards the lead, thus creating an upward deflection (Rwave) on the ECG. It is followed by depolarization of the main mass of the LV, which occurs away from the lead, thus creating a downward deflection (S wave). This pattern is reversed for lead V6, explaining the different shapes of the QRS complex. This pattern should be checked in every ECG. LA: left atrium; LV: left ventricle; RA: right atrium; RV: right ventricle. QRS wave complex The three waves of the QRS complex represent ventricular depolarization. For the inexperienced, one of the most
