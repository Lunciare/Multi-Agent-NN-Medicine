is provided in Figure 6. The only way to become confident at reading ECGs is to practice. It is important to be methodical – every ECG reading should start with an assessment of the rate, rhythm, and axis. This approach always reveals something about an ECG, regardless of how unusual it is. 21 Chapter 3 Number of large squares Heart rate between QRS complexes (bpm) 5 60 4 75 3 100 2 150 Table 2.Some common heart rates as determined by analysis of the QRS complex. Rate Identify the QRS complex (this is generally the biggest wave); count the number of large squares between one QRS wave and the next; divide 300 by this number to determine the rate (see Table 2). Rhythm P waves are the key to determining whether a patient is in sinus rhythm or not. If P waves are not clearly visible in the chest leads, look for them in the other leads. The presence of P waves immediately before every QRS complex indicates sinus rhythm. If there are no P waves, note whether the QRS complexes are wide or narrow, regular or irregular. No P waves and irregular narrow QRS complexes This is the hallmark
