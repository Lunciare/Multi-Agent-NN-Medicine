Cardiology

thyrotoxicosis, hypovolemia, pulmonary emboli, myocardial ischemia, and shock. Nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, and some medications (sympathetic agonists or parasympatholytic agents) are frequently the underlying cause of sinus tachycardia. The QRS complexes are preceded by P waves of normal morphology, duration, and axis. Sinus tachycardia alone does not require any treatment, but the underlying cause should be determined. Atrial tachycardia Atrial tachycardia can occur in the presence of cardiac or pulmonary disease at a rate varying from 140 to 240 bpm. P-wave morphology is generally different from that during SR, but the P–QRS relationship remains 1:1 (see Figure 12). Some atrial tachycardias are catecholamine sensitive; in this case, a b-blocker is appropriate therapy. Curative radiofrequency ablation of atrial tachycardia is effective in 70% of cases. For refractory cases, creation of complete heart block by radiofrequency catheter ablation with implantation of a permanent dual-chamber pacemaker provides control of the rate and avoids drug toxicity. 123 Chapter 8 Shape of complex Diagnosis Irregular narrow complex Atrial fibrillation Atrial flutter (sawtooth pattern) Multifocal atrial tachycardia (distinct P waves, but with different morphologies) Regular narrow complex Sinus tachycardia Atrial flutter with constant AV block AVNRT Accessory pathway re-entrant tachycardia Irregular broad complex Atrial fibrillation + LBBB/RBBB
