the diagnosis: standing reduces end diastolic volume (EDV), bringing the click–murmur nearer to the first heart sound; squatting increases EDV (and afterload), moving the click–murmur nearer to the second heart sound. Patients with these findings should be referred for echo assessment. Interestingly, there is no absolute consensus on criteria for diagnosing MVP on two-dimensional echo. The 161 Chapter 9 diagnosis should never be made on one view alone (especially if that is the 4-chamber view). Serial echos are not necessary unless there is a change in the clinical picture. Management involves reassurance and prophylaxis for endocarditis. Patients who suffer from palpitations should have Holter/event monitoring to make a firm diagnosis. Aspirin is recommended for patients with documented focal neurological events who are in sinus rhythm and have no atrial thrombus. Recurrent transient ischemic attacks or stroke in MVP patients demand long-term warfarin therapy. Ultimately, MV repair may be required, and the indications are as for MR (described above). Tricuspid valve disease In comparison with the left side, the right side of the heart is a low-pressure system. Consequently, disorders such as endocarditis, in which high-pressure jets help to “seed” the infective vegetations, occur less frequently. The notable exception is in
