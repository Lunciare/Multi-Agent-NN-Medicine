vegetation on the mitral valve (arrow). Clinical signs of chronic mitral regurgitation Prominent and sustained apex beat Systolic thrill at the apex Left parasternal heave – resulting from left atrium expansion, rather than right ventricular hypertrophy Soft first heart sound Pansystolic murmur at the apex that radiates into the axilla Third heart sound that is high pitched due to high early diastolic filling velocities Table 6.The clinical signs of chronic mitral regurgitation. effective. Intra-aortic balloon pumping can also help to achieve these goals. In many cases, emergency surgery is warranted. If so, prior transesophageal echo helps to characterize the anatomy and severity of the lesion. Cardiac catheterization should be performed if the patient is at high risk for CAD. Chronic mitral regurgitation Causes • Degenerative MV disease is common in the elderly. The valve leaflets are thickened, redundant, increased in area, and they prolapse into the LA in systole. The chordae may become elongated, thinned, and tortuous – predisposing to rupture. 158 Valve disease Optimal sarcomere length Actin Actin Frank–Starling curve Normal resting length Sarcomere length LV dysfunction Ventricular end-diastolic volume Figure 7.Frank–Starling curve showing left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. • Infective endocarditis is a major cause of chronic MR.
