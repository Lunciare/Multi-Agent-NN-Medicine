rare. However, some form of electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormality is common. These changes are either present in all 12 leads or in leads that do not correspond to the territory perfused by a single coronary artery. Low voltages suggest the possibility of effusion. Chest x-ray A chest x-ray (CXR) can help to rule out a tuberculous cause of pericarditis and exclude significant effusion. Echocardiography Echocardiography is helpful mainly if there is a suspicion of effusion or tamponade. Blood tests Blood tests for immune markers, such as the antinuclear cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), should be carried out in any patient with confirmed pericarditis. Acute and convalescent viral titers can also be requested, but rarely alter management. 198 Pericardial disease Figure 2.An extreme form of pericardial effusion, known as a “swinging heart”. The arrow indicates the effusion. Management Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the treatment of choice for pericarditis. They relieve both the inflammatory process and the pain. Steroids may be required in serositic pericarditis, whereas pericarditis with a suspicious CXR and constitutional symptoms should prompt investigation for tuberculosis. Pericardial effusion and tamponade As with pleural effusion, the key defining presentation of pericardial effusion is the rate of fluid accumulation. Any cause of pericarditis can
