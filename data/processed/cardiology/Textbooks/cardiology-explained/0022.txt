the bundle of His where it splits into two pathways and travels along the right and left bundle branches. The impulse travels the length of the bundles along the interventricular septum to the base of the heart, where the bundles divide into the Purkinje system. From here, the wave of depolarization is distributed to the ventricular walls and initiates ventricular contraction. 18 Conquering the ECG R J point P T U ST segment Q PR interval S QRS interval QT interval Figure 4.The basic pattern of electrical activity across the heart. The ECG trace The ECG machine processes the signals picked up from the skin by electrodes and produces a graphic representation of the electrical activity of the patient’s heart. The basic pattern of the ECG is logical: • electrical activity towards a lead causes an upward deflection • electrical activity away from a lead causes a downward deflection • depolarization and repolarization deflectionsoccur in opposite directions The basic pattern of this electrical activity was first discovered over a hundred years ago. It comprises three waves, which have been named P, QRS (a wave complex), and T (see Figure4). P wave The P wave is a small deflection wave that
