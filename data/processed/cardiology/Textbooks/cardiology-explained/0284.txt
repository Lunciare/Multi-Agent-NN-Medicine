Although the fun of the mystery is often in the debate and not in the answer, this is one theory that could be tested: a limited amount of bone fragments and hair from Lincoln was retained by the attending physician at the time of his assassination. Molecular testing using these samples could end the debate in an instant. 190 Aneurysm and dissection of the aorta Arterial lumen Endothelial cells Intima Internal elastic lamina Media (smooth muscle cells) External elastic lamina Adventitia (fibroblasts, elastin, collagen) Figure 2. The adventitia, media, and intima of the aortic wall. • an armspan greater than height • upward lens dislocation • aortic root dilatation and aortic incompetence • mitral valve prolapse The key differential diagnosis is homocystinuria, a recessively inherited defect in amino-acid metabolism, which has similar skeletal features. Homocystinuria is associated with low IQ and typically causes downward dislocation of the lens. However, it does not affect the heart. Marfan’s patients should undergo annual echo screening of the aortic root and prophylactic replacement should be considered when the diameter reaches 55 mm (a normal diameter is 40 mm). Beta-blockade can retard the rate of dilatation,
