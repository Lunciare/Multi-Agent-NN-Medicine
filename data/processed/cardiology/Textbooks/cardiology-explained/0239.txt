Cardiology

for those with: • class II–IV symptoms, EF >60%, LVESD <45 mm • EF 30%–60%, LVESD 45–55 mm (regardless of symptoms) • asymptomatic patients with AF and normal EF • symptomatic patients with normal EF and pulmonary hypertension (>50 mm Hg) • asymptomatic patients with EF 50%–60% and LVESD <45 mm, or EF >60% and LVESD 45–55 mm • patients with EF <30% and/or LVESD >55 mm in whom the chordae tendineae are likely to be intact (ie, no previous MI in that territory) The operation of choice is MV repair. In many patients, however, replacement of the valve together with removal of part or all of the MV apparatus (chordae) is required. The repair procedure leads to better postoperative LV function and survival. There is no generally accepted medical therapy for chronic MR. Although vasodilators might seem a sensible choice, in fact, in compensated chronic MR the afterload is decreased (since the LV has two routes of ejection); as such, drugs that reduce the afterload further are unlikely to be beneficial. Chronic MR can also occur due to a primary ischemic cause, relating either to LV dysfunction or to chordal ischemia – revascularization or stenting can eliminate the episodes.
