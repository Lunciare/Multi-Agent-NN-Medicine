Syncope Syncope is defined as a sudden transient loss of consciousness and postural tone with spontaneous recovery. A careful diagnostic evaluation, though often difficult, is imperative in all patients. A vast variety of conditions may result in syncope, including any condition causing relative cerebral hypoxia for ≥10 seconds. It occurs as a result of low cardiac output and can be a consequence of mechanical, rhythm, and vascular disturbances, and noncardiac causes (see Table 3). It should be kept in mind that generalized tonic/clonic movements can be the result of syncope, rather than the cause of it. Evaluation It can be difficult to identify the cause of syncope. Initial clinical evaluation should include supine and erect blood pressures and heart rate measurements. Blood glucose, serum electrolytes, hematocrit, and drug levels (if appropriate) should also be obtained. Assessment of a syncopal event requires information from both the patient and a witness; the pattern can be helpful (see Table 4). A baseline 12-lead ECG may suggest possible causes such as ischemia, Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome, 114 Arrhythmia Type of disturbance Examples Mechanical Cardiac valvular disease Acute myocardial infarction Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Tamponade Pulmonary embolus Rhythm Sinus node dysfunction Bradycardia Tachycardia Vascular Cerebrovascular disorders Neurally mediated
