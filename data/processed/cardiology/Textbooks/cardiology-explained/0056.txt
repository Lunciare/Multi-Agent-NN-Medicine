examination History-taking is the most valuable technique for differentiating between the many causes of chest discomfort. The classic symptoms of angina are well known: a sensation of a constriction of the chest with variable levels of radiation to the neck, jaw, both arms, and occasionally to the epigastrium or through to the back. The pain is worse with exertion, especially in cold air; improved by rest and nitrates; and often follows a meal. Retrosternal pain in particular (often described by patients as “pressure”) suggests that angina is the cause. Pains that are localized elsewhere, described as sharp or stabbing, or reproduced by palpation are much less likely to be cardiac in origin. The term “unstable angina” encompasses a number of presentations, including pain that: • occurs at rest • lasts longer than 30 minutes • is not relieved by several doses of sublingual nitrate • is elicited over days or weeks by gradually smaller amounts of exertion (crescendo angina) Examination of the cardiovascular system is mandatory in any patient reporting chest pain. Sweating, nausea, and vomiting are suggestive of MI, while complications of MI – such as heart failure (third heart sound and basal crackles) ventricular septal defect (VSD), harsh
