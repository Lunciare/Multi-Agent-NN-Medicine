failure with an effect equivalent to that of ACE inhibition (25 mg spironolactone has a beneficial effect on remodeling, but essentially no effect on potassium levels and diuresis). Metolazone is a thiazide-like diuretic that has a powerful synergistic action with loop diuretics, so should be used in the community only as a last resort, for short periods, and be accompanied by daily electrolyte checks. 101 Chapter 7 Spironolactone Thiazide diuretics Na+ CI– Na+ K+ K+H+ H Ni ag +h NLo aw + Collecting Low High duct K+ K+ Distal tubule K+ CI– Na+ Loop diuretics Loop of Henle inhibition Figure 6.The mechanism of action of diuretics in chronic heart failure management. DEFINING HEARTS Pulmonary edema was first explained by Henry Welch, who showed that it could be reproduced by obstructing the outflow of the left ventricle. However, the first definition of heart failure was provided by Theophile Bonet (1620–1689), who published clinico-pathological studies linking the effects of valvular disease and cardiac chamber size to the clinical features of dyspnea and edema. 102 Heart failure Class Compound Mechanism of action Loop Furosemide Inhibit triporter pump in thick ascending diuretics (frusemide), loop of Henle, thus inhibiting Na+ and bumetanide, Cl– reabsorption, which
