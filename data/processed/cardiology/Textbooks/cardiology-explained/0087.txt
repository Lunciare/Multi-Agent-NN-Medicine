possible for some time). However, as new technology moves the field forward, this is likely to become more attainable, and with it the tempting prospect of cross-sectional imaging and plaque characterization. Stable angina: treatment Cardiac catheterization Since cardiac MRI is still only available in the bigger centers, coronary artery catheterization remains the diagnostic gold standard in CAD. As the conduit for coronary intervention, its position is also safe from advances in imaging technology. Catheterization can also be used in a variety of settings aside from CAD, such as ventricular dysfunction, valve disease, detection and quantification of shunts, and other congenital and acquired structural abnormalities. The basic procedure of PTCA involves cannulation of the femoral artery, with manipulation of a catheter over a guide wire to the site of stenosis. Dye is injected into each coronary artery in turn to assess flow. Flow is graded using a system first put forward by the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) investigators (see Table 6). In balloon angioplasty a balloon is inflated (using the image- enhancing contrast dye) to compress the atheroma and dilate the artery (see Figure 8). Until recently, this was the intervention of choice. However, balloon angioplasty has a restenosis rate
