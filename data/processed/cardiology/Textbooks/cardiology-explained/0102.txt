encouraging. Recanalization is achieved following thrombolysis in approximately 70% of cases (compared with 15% of cases without thrombolysis). As this leaves a significant minority needing further attention, all patients should be reviewed 2 hours following thrombolysis. Rethrombolysis or coronary intervention should be considered if there is no resolution in the ST segment. There are few absolute contraindications to thrombolysis and risks must be weighed against benefits in each individual case, particularly in the face of a large anterior infarct in a patient where access to primary PTCA is unavailable. However, there are some absolute contraindications and some notable relative contraindications. Absolute contraindications are: • suspected aortic dissection (demands urgent CT, which is the gold standard, MRI, or transesophageal echo) • active internal bleeding or uncontrollable external bleeding (excluding menses) • recent head trauma (<2 weeks) • intracranial neoplasms • history of proven hemorrhagic stroke or cerebral infarction within 12 months • untreated diabetic hemorrhagic/proliferative retinopathy • BP >180/110mm Hg uncontrolled (reduce with nitrates, b-blockade, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) Relative contraindications are: • pregnancy • traumatic prolonged CPR • anticoagulation or INR >1.8 • bleeding disorders • recent surgery (within 3 weeks) • probable intracardiac thrombus (eg, atrial fibrillation with mitral stenosis)
