There is some debate over exactly who invented the electrocardiogram. The Dutch “K” (elektrokardiogram) is often used as a tribute to the Indonesian- born physician Wilhelm Einthoven who, while working in The Netherlands in 1924, received the Nobel prize for “the discovery of the mechanism of the electrocardiogram”. In fact, it was Augustus Désiré Waller, a physician trained in Edinburgh, who presented – to the students of St Mary’s Hospital medical school, London, at the introductory lecture of the 1888 academic year – his “cardiograph”, the first ever ECG recording in man. It was some years later, in 1901, that Wilhelm Einthoven reported his string galvanometer – with the limb leads labeled I, II, and III and the waves labeled P, QRS, and T as we know them today. In fact, although often credited with inventing the term electrocardiogram (which is why it is sometimes spelt the Dutch way), Einthoven credits Waller with this distinction in his 1895 publication in Pflügers Archives “Über die Form des menschlichen Elektrokardiogramms”. 25
