ill? In nonacute patients, cachexia is perhaps the most important feature to note on general inspection since it is an important prognostic sign in heart failure. Palpation is essential to confirm that girth is excess fluid (pitting edema). Certain physical appearances should always prompt an awareness of cardiac abnormalities (see Table 1). Facial signs for which there is evidence of an association with cardiac conditions are shown in Table 2. Finally, it is important to document the condition of a potential cardiac patient’s teeth. Genetic disorder Associated cardiac manifestation Marfan’s syndrome Aortic regurgitation (aortic dissection) Down’s syndrome ASD, VSD Turner’s syndrome Coarctation of the aorta Spondyloarthritides, Aortic regurgitation eg, ankylosing spondylitis Table 1.Cardiac manifestations of genetic disorders. ASD: atrial septal defect; VSD: ventricular septal defect. Taking the pulse Taking the pulse is one of the simplest, oldest, and yet most informative of all clinical tests. As you pick up the patient’s hand, you should check for clubbing and any peripheral signs of endocarditis (see Table 3). Note the rate and document the rhythm of the pulse. The character and volume of the pulse can also be useful signs and traditionally it is believed that these are easier to detect in
