scan (see Figures 4 and5, previous page) • transesophageal echo to assess possible aortic regurgitation (see Figure 6,previous page) • transthoracic echo for pericardial effusion • preoperatively, coronary artery disease must be ruled out by coronary angiography 194 Aneurysm and dissection of the aorta A physical examination can prove useful diagnostically, but should not delay the above emergency investigations. It should include: • measurement of the BP in both arms (unequal BP is a sign, though not a reliable sign) • documentation of all peripheral pulses (lack of peripheral pulses may be the only sign if the dissection spares the ascending aorta) • close attention to heart sounds (aortic regurgitation and tamponade are possible with proximal extension) • neurologic examination (hemiplegia or paraplegia can result from occlusion of the carotid arteries and anterior spinal arteries, respectively) Other potentially useful investigations are: • assessment of renal function, including urine microscopy and catheterization for accurate measurement of renal output • a chest x-ray, which often shows a distended aorta or generalized widening of the mediastinum (see Figures 7 and8) Further reading Erbel R, Alfonso F, Boileau C et al.; Task Force on Aortic Dissection, European Society of Cardiology.
