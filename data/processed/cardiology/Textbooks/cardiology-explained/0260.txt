If fever and a changing murmur coexist then urgent referral is warranted, although, even here, it can be useful to take blood cultures and a bottle for serology (for the diagnosis of culture-negative endocarditis) yourself. Specialist management Investigations Blood cultures Blood cultures are the primary investigation in the diagnosis of IE and yield the causative micro-organism in up to 95% of cases. A failure to do so can be due to prior antibiotic treatment, the presence of fastidious organisms (eg, belonging to the HACEK group), or unusual organisms such as Candida, Chlamydia, or Brucella.
