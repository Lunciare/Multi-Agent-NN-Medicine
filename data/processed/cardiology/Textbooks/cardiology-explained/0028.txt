For the I lead, plot net positives to the right and net negatives to the left; for the aVF lead, plot positive downwards and negative upwards • the direction of the endpoint from the starting point represents the axis or predominant direction of electrical depolarization (determined primarily by the muscle mass of the left ventricle). It is expressed as an angle and can be estimated quite easily (normal is 0º–120º) 23 Chapter 3 HUMAN RESUSCITATION The first electrical resuscitation of a
