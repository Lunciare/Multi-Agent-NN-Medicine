levels are also high. Acute coronary syndromes: assessment Risk assessment is the key to in-hospital management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Patients with ST elevation need to be considered immediately for thrombolysis or acute intervention. Other patients should be closely monitored (preferably in a coronary care unit) if they have risk factors, previous infarction, poor ventricular function, and changing ST segments. In this situation, the key investigation is the measurement of cardiac enzymes. Markers of myocardial damage A number of markers for not only infarction, but also noninfarct ischemia, are now available. The transaminases aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) no longer offer any advantage over the other markers and in fact often cause false-positive results. Timescales of the variation in levels of the most commonly used markers for myocardial damage are outlined in Table 7 and Figure 10. Of the markers in Table 7, troponin I or T are the most specific and sensitive markers to rule acute MI out or in. 68 Coronary artery disease 7 Myoglobin Total CK 6 CK-MB 5 LDH Troponin I 4 3 2 0 20 40 60 80 100 12 140 160 Hours from onset of infarction Figure 10.Appearance of cardiac markers
