Cardiology

is most commonly due to ischemic heart disease or drug toxicity (in particular b-blockers, digitalis, and calcium-channel blockers). Bradyarrhythmia in atrial fibrillation In patients with intermittent or chronic AF, AV node dysfunction is not an uncommon finding. Clearly, this will be aggravated by many of the rate-limiting drugs given to control the ventricular rate. In these cases, consideration should be given to the implantation of a pacemaker to protect against bradycardia while still allowing pharmacological control of a rapid ventricular rate. 118 Arrhythmia Figure 4.Electrocardiogram of first-degree atrioventricular block.

Bundle branch block A problem in the bundle of His presents in an identical fashion to a combined block of both bundles, ie, complete heart block. However, a more common occurrence is an isolated left or right bundle branch block. These are usually distinct from any problem with AV conduction (ie, they usually coexist with normal sinus rhythm
