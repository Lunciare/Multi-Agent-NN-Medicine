signs • hepatomegaly • pulsus paradoxus (but usually less severe than in tamponade) • pericardial knock (high-pitched early diastolic added sound) • calcification visible on the lateral CXR The most difficult differential diagnosis is restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, the left ventricular function is usually preserved in constrictive pericarditis, and filling pressures are raised. The only treatment for constrictive pericarditis is surgical excision of the pericardium. 201 202 Chapter 14 Adult congenital heart disease Congenital abnormalities of the heart and cardiovascular system are reported in almost 1% of live births (see Figure 1) and about half of these children need medical or surgical help during infancy. In the first decade, a further 25% require surgery to maintain or improve their life. Only 10% survive to adolescence without surgery. Of these 10%, however, many live a normal life for years before their abnormality is discovered. Recognizing adult congenital heart disease There are a few signs that should alert generalists to the possibility of congenital heart disease: • murmurs, especially continuous – there are few degenerative diseases that produce continuous murmurs • cyanosis, clubbing – unless there is coexistent lung disease, a patient with a murmur and cyanosis should be referred for echocardiography •
