probe is passed down the esophagus until it is level with the heart. This position provides especially clear views. It is particularly useful for imaging posterior cardiac structures. The key indications for TEE are: • infective endocarditis – if vegetations are not seen on transthoracic echo, but suspicion is high, or with prosthetic valves • to rule out an embolic source (especially in atrial fibrillation) • acute dissection • mitral valve (MV) disease preoperatively Contrast echocardiography Contrast echo can be useful for confirming a diagnosis of atrial septal defect (ASD). Agitating saline or synthetic contrast create microbubbles. These are very reflective, 38 Understanding the echocardiogram Normal ranges for measures of systolic and diastolic function Echocardiography Fractional shortening (%) 28–44 Doppler Systolic velocity integral (cm) 15–35 Mitral valve E (cm/s) 44–100 Mitral valve A (cm/s) 20–60 E:A ratio 0.7–3.1 Tricuspid valve E (cm/s) 20–50 Tricuspid valve A (cm/s) 12–36 E:A ratio 0.8–2.9 Time intervals Mitral E deceleration time (ms) 139–219 Mitral A deceleration time (ms) >70 Isovolumic relaxation time (ms) 54–98 Normal intracardiac dimensions (cm) Men Women Left atrium 3.0–4.5 2.7–4.0 LV diastolic diameter 4.3–5.9 4.0–5.2 LV systolic diameter 2.6–4.0 2.3–3.5 IV septum (diastole) 0.6–1.3 0.5–1.2 Posterior wall (diastole) 0.6–1.2 0.5–1.1
