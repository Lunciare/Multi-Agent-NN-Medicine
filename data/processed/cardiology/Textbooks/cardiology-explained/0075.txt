that acts by sequestering bile acids in the gut, thus increasing the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol • fibrates, which reduce the level of VLDL by increasing the activity of the VLDL-hydrolyzing enzyme LPL 56 Coronary artery disease Guidelines for the use of lipid-lowering therapy have become more aggressive over the past few years following the results of major trials showing mortality benefit for the use of statins. Most guidelines recommend statin treatment for a patient with CAD with a 10-year risk that is greater than 20% (high risk) once a trial of dietary therapy has been unsuccessful. However, treatment can be cost effective with a 10-year risk of 10%. Recent trials have identified anti-inflammatory properties of statins and benefit even in patients with normal cholesterol levels. Dosage should be adjusted according to cholesterol levels. As part of secondary prevention, the following levels should be reached: total cholesterol, <200 mg/dL (5.2 mmol/L); HDL, >40 mg/dL (1 mmol/L); LDL, <100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L); triglyceride, <200mg/dL (2.3 mmol/L). Refer with confidence Early management of stable coronary disease is mostly done in the community. Risk factor and stepwise pharmacological management of stable angina are appropriate. If there is any doubt about the
