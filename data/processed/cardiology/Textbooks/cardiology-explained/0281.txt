be treated with steroids, cytotoxic drugs, and prophylactic anticoagulants for thromboembolism. Endomyocardial fibrosis that is not controlled by medical therapy may warrant surgical intervention for subendocardial decortication. Carcinoid syndrome may require tricuspid valve replacement (see Chapter 9, Valve disease). Further reading Maron BJ, Moller JH, Seidman C et al.

Both share the same primary cause: atherosclerosis. In the past, ascending aortic aneurysms were typically caused by syphilis, but nowadays hypertension or Marfan’s syndrome are more likely to be responsible. Symptoms result from the acute painful tear felt as central chest pain, which radiates to the back, and from the compression
