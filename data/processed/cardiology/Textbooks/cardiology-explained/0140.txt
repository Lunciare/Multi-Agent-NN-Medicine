by blocking the sympathetic nervous system would have been regarded as heretical and dangerous. However, it has now been realized that most CHF pathology is a result of the body’s own compensatory mechanisms (see Figure2) and that interrupting these neurohumoral pathways achieves more than attempting to “overdrive” the failing heart. The exception is acute decompensation (acute heart failure, pulmonary edema, cardiogenic shock), where the focus is on short-term survival; although the primary aim is still the reduction of preload and 94 Heart failure (a) The old treatment paradigm Fluid overload Pump function Underperfusion of organs Frank–Starling curve (b) The new treatment paradigm End diastolic pressure ADH Volume Renin– overload a syn sg ti eo mtensin Vasoconstriction Preload Afterload Pump function Underperfusion Sympathetic of organs system Tachycardia Coronary perfusion Treatment: interrupt neurohormonal pathways Figure 1.Treatment of heart failure according to (a) old and (b) new paradigms.

Clinical history and examination The hallmark of heart failure is dyspnea. The classic combination of raised jugular venous pressure (JVP), peripheral edema, palpable liver, basal crepitations, tachycardia, and a third heart sound is well known. Orthopnea (shortness
