antimicrobial treatment may be required. A second site for fever should always be excluded. Surgical intervention Surgical intervention may be required in patients with persistent fever that is resistant to medical therapy. Surgery is also indicated in the following conditions: 175 Chapter 10 • valve obstruction • prosthetic-valve endocarditis caused by S.aureusor resistant organisms • aortic or mitral regurgitation not responding to medical therapy • paravalvular abscess • development of an aneurysm of a sinus of Valsalva • fungal endocarditis • multiple embolic episodes • progressive heart failure secondary to severe valve destruction • oscillating vegetation of >1 cm Surgery may involve not only valve replacement, but also aortic root replacement for aortic root abscesses. After the relevant surgical procedure, a full course of antibiotic eradication therapy should be administered. Prognosis With effective treatment, patients with IE have a 70% survival rate. The prognosis is worse if there is no identifiable organism or if there is a resistant organism. Fungal infections are associated with increased mortality, as is prosthetic valve endocarditis. Overall death rates are 20% for native valve endocarditis, 30% for staphylococcal infections, and 20%–30% for late prosthetic valve infection, despite full medical and surgical treatment.
