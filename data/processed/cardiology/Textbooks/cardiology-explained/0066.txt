the elaboration of several endothelium- derived substances, such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and superoxide dismutase. Although prostacyclin may exert its antiatherogenic effects by inhibiting the uptake of cholesterol esters into macrophages or into smooth muscle cells, nitric oxide contributes strongly to the inhibition of monocyte adhesion, and inhibits platelet aggregation at much lower concentrations than those needed to inhibit adhesion, thereby allowing platelets to participate in the repair of the vessel wall, while at the same time preventing or limiting thrombus formation. Flow also modulates the expression of numerous paracrine substances, including endothelial growth factors, matrix modulators, chemokines, and regulators of blood fluidity, all of which may participate in the beneficial effects of exercise-induced vascular remodeling and reactivity. Finally, exercise-induced changes in flow also have other antiatherogenic effects. Endothelial cells exposed to shear stress elaborate less superoxide anion; this may in part be due to increased transcription of superoxide dismutase. There are also shear stress responsive elements in the promoter region of several adhesion molecules (eg, intercellular adhesion molecule) that may reduce their gene expression. Diet The central components of a healthy diet are well known: low in fat; low in salt; low in cholesterol; low in calories. In detail,
