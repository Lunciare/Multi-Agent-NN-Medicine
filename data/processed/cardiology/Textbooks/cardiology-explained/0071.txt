omitted, since oral anticoagulation with an international normalized ratio (INR) of 3–4 has been shown to be safe and effective. Oral long-acting nitrate Nitrates are smooth muscle relaxants with the ability to vasodilate both the arteriolar and venous circulation. This leads to reductions in both preload (venous return) and afterload (blood pressure). However, nitrate-free periods are necessary to avoid tolerance. Beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers Beta-blockers work by reducing the heart rate (lengthening diastole increases the time for coronary perfusion) and reducing the effects of catecholamine-mediated increases in cardiac workload. Calcium-channel blockers cause coronary artery dilation and subsequently decrease cardiac workload by reducing the contractility of myocardial smooth muscle cells. Calcium-channel blockers can be divided into rate-limiting (eg, verapamil, diltiazem) and nonrate-limiting (dihydropyridines, eg, amlodipine). Dihydropyridines are generally prescribed for hypertension, whereas the others tend to be used in cases of angina because of their ability to reduce the heart rate. However, verapamil should not be used with b-blockers, which block the action of sympathetic hormones (resulting in a lower heart rate and blood pressure) (see Chapter 6, Hypertension). 54 Coronary artery disease Potassium-channel openers Potassium-channel openers, such as nicorandil, are a new class of agents for the treatment of angina.
