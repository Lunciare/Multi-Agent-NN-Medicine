catecholamines), and a reduction in sudden death (probably related to a reduction in ventricular fibrillation – 50% of heart failure deaths are due to arrhythmia). Digoxin Digoxin has perhaps the longest history of any of the treatments for heart failure. However, being a positive inotrope, it occupies a controversial place overarching the old and new paradigms for the treatment of sinus rhythm heart failure. It works by increasing cellular calcium via inhibition of Na+/K+ATPase and consequent reduction of Ca2+ extrusion via Na+/Ca2+ exchange (see Figure 7). As K+ “competes” with digoxin at the ATPase site, digoxin can become toxic in hypokalemic patients. Symptoms of digoxin toxicity are gastrointestinal upset and (more rarely) visual disturbances and headache. However, despite its widespread use, there have been no large, prospective, placebo-controlled trials to determine the efficacy of digoxin in reducing mortality (although it has been shown to reduce hospital admissions). Hydralazine and nitrates The vasodilator combination of hydralazine (up to 300 mg) and nitrates (160 mg isosorbide dinitrate) has been tested with digoxin and diuretics in several large trials and has been associated with mortality reductions in heart failure. However, the advent of ARBs is likely to offer a better alternative to ACEIs
