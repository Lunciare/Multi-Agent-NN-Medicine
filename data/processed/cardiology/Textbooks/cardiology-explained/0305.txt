fetus (see Figure 8). Since aortic diastolic pressure is higher than pulmonary artery systolic pressure, there is continuous flow into the pulmonary circulation, creating the characteristic continuous (“machinery”) murmur, heard best just below the left clavicle. In hemodynamically insignificant lesions (>50% of cases), patients are asymptomatic. Patients with bigger shunts develop cardiac failure at an age that depends on the severity of the lesion. Eisenmenger syndrome can occur with PDA. Treatment is surgical closure of the duct; this can be carried out percutaneously. Fallot’s tetralogy Fallot’s tetralogy is one of the causes of cyanotic congenital heart disease. The features derive from an abnormally positioned aorta that “over-rides” the interventricular septum (see Figure 9). This causes: • perimembranous VSD • RV outflow obstruction (pulmonary stenosis) • RVH The chief symptom is cyanosis on exercise. Children typically “squat” for relief of dyspnea after exercise (almost pathognomonic). Chest pain, arrhythmia, and congestive heart failure are more common in adults than in children. Clubbing is common. Surgical correction usually involves resection of the hypertrophied RV infundibulum and VSD closure with incorporation of the aorta into the RV. Adult Fallot’s patients often suffer impaired exercise capacity due to poor RV function. Transposition of the great
