(Longmore JM et al. The Oxford Handbook of Clinical Medicine, 5th Edn, p. 79). The JVP should be assessed with the patient reclined at a 45º angle (see Figure 2). Accepted practice is that only the internal jugular vein should be used, as only this vessel joins the superior vena cava at a 180º angle. The JVP is defined as the height of the waveform in centimeters above the sternal angle (<4 cm is normal). Abnormalities of the JVP are described in Table 5. 8 Cardiovascular examination Internal External jugular jugular vein vein Sternocleidomastoid muscle Figure 2.The jugular veins. The patient is lying at a 45°angle, thus revealing the surface markings of the neck. JVP abnormalities Probable cause Large “a” wave Tricuspid stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary stenosis Cannon wave Atrial fibrillation, complete heart block, VVI pacing, ventricular tachycardia (a cannon wave occurs when the right atrium contracts against a closed tricuspid valve) Steep “x”, “y” descent Constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade Large “v” wave, “cv” wave Tricuspid regurgitation Kussmaul’s sign Rise of JVP on inspiration, constrictive pericarditis, cardiac tamponade Table 5.Abnormalities of the jugular venous pressure (JVP). Palpation Before auscultation, inspection of the precordium can be a useful indicator of previous
