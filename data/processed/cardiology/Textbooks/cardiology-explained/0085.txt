Cardiology

chronic situation in which the blood flow of a segment is not adequate for function, yet is sufficient for it to remain viable. During periods of stress, these areas of myocardium “recover” and their viability can be detected as improvements (compared with at rest) in segmental contraction on exposure to low-dose pharmacological stress. Stress echo is a useful technique in the hands of an experienced operator in a patient with a good echo window. Views can also be greatly improved by the use of a supine bicycle. Electron beam computed tomography This is a new technique that relies on imaging calcium in coronary lesions. It can quantify the “atherosclerotic burden” in the form of a calcium score to give an estimate of risk or to monitor the effect of, for example, lipid-lowering therapy. However, there is some doubt over how much information this measure adds to standard risk factors. Furthermore, vulnerable plaque often does not contain much calcium. The “holy grail” is a test that can locate and quantify “vulnerable” plaque, but this has not yet been found. Magnetic resonance imaging Most cardiologists agree that the future of noninvasive imaging of the heart lies with MRI. This technology can fulfill
