with a fever, the patient should be urgently referred to a cardiologist for blood cultures and echocardiography – the level of risk will determine whether this is transesophageal echo (TEE) or transthoracic echo. Blind treatment with antibiotics should not be undertaken since it will delay diagnosis and identification of the causal organism. Antibiotics should not be initiated before three sets of blood cultures have been taken. Formal diagnosis The Duke diagnostic classification for IE divides signs and symptoms into major and minor criteria (see Table 1). IE is diagnosed if patients have: • two major criteria; or • one major and three minor criteria; or • five minor criteria These criteria are associated with a 99% specificity for diagnosis in follow-up studies. It has been proposed that the minor criteria be extended to include erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), splenomegaly, microscopic hematuria, and newly diagnosed clubbing. This adjustment increases diagnostic sensitivity by 10%. Intravenous drug abuse Right-sided endocarditis is common in intravenous drug abusers (IVDAs) because of nonsterile injection into the venous system. The presentation tends to differ from that of classic IE, in that these patients are more likely to develop pneumonia or septic pulmonary emboli
