block (Mobitz type II; third-degree) – the ventricle is paced either following a normal atrial contraction or a paced atrial contraction. The benefit of this – that ventricular contraction will “track” the increased 135 Chapter 8 Indication Pacemaker Clear consensus type for indication Sick sinus syndrome bradycardia AAI, DDD Yes Carotid sinus syndrome syncope DDI Yes Complete heart block DDD Yes (third-degree AV block) Mobitz II block (second-degree AV block) DDD Yes AF + AV block (pauses >3 seconds, VVI(R) Yes ventricular rate <40 bpm) Trifascicular block DDD No Malignant vasovagal syndrome DDI No Table 7.Standard indications for pacemakers. AF: atrial fibrillation; AV: atrioventricular. atrial rate of exercise tachycardia – is also its biggest drawback; it will also increase the ventricular pacing rate in the presence of abnormally increased atrial contraction, eg, atrial tachycardia (2) VVI – this type of box is considerably cheaper than those boxes capable of DDD programming. It senses and paces only the ventricle and, consequently, only requires one lead. VVI boxes are indicated for use in AF with bradycardia and AV block, and in sinus bradycardia with no AV block. They can cause pacemaker syndrome and retrograde atrial tachycardia. They can also trigger AF. (3)
