valves should cover streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), and Gram-negative organisms. Vancomycin or teicoplanin with gentamicin have good synergistic cover. In drug abusers, treatment for endocarditis should include cover for S. aureusand Gram-negative bacilli (eg, cloxacillin and pipercillin). In the treatment of rarer causes of endocarditis, Coxiella may require doxycycline with cotrimoxazole or rifampicin. Candidaand Aspergillusmay respond to medical therapy (5-fluorouracil and amphotericin B, respectively), but, generally, all three of these infections respond poorly to medical therapy alone and require surgical intervention. In the treatment of IE, from any source, fever may still be present 2 weeks after starting the appropriate treatment, even with drug-sensitive organisms. This could be due to the presence of an underlying large vegetation or abscess. If fever persists, the sensitivity of the infecting organism should be checked and drug levels monitored. Repeat echo should be performed to exclude increasing vegetation size or abscess formation. If, despite these measures, the fever remains, the possibility of antibiotic resistance should be considered and a further synergistic antimicrobial treatment may be required. A second site for fever should always be excluded. Surgical intervention Surgical intervention may be required in patients with persistent fever that is resistant to
