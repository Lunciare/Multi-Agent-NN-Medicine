Symptoms associated with bradycardia include shortness of breath, fatigue, lethargy, nausea, mental confusion, dizziness, and presyncope or syncope. If there is hemodynamic compromise and interruption of cerebral perfusion is prolonged, grand mal seizures may result (Stokes–Adams attacks). The causes of bradycardia are outlined in Table 2. 112 Arrhythmia Causes of bradycardia Physiological Sinus node disease •Athletic bradycardia Atrioventricular node disease Drugs Abnormal vagal tone •Beta-blockers Carotid sinus hypersensitivity •Rate-limiting calcium-channel blockers Malignant vasovagal syndrome •Digoxin Raised intracranial pressure •Amiodarone Hypothyroidism Ischemia Hypothermia Table 2.Causes of bradycardia.
