Cardiology

that it is not exposed until it is in position – that allows the lead to be fixed into the myocardium. After the leads are positioned, a series of tests are carried out to determine if the lead position is satisfactory from an electrical point of view. These would typically assess: • threshold – the voltage required to cause a contraction. This increases if the lead is not well-positioned and can be a sensitive method of detecting poor placement • lead impedance – this is a test of the integrity of the lead. It is essentially a measure of electrical resistance and is measured in Ohms • abnormal stimulation of the phrenic nerve – a high-voltage protocol tests for a diaphragmatic twitch THE PACEMAKER’S MAKER Canadian John Hopps invented the first cardiac pacemaker. Hopps was trained as an electrical engineer at the University of Manitoba and joined the National Research Council in 1941, where he conducted research on hypothermia. While experimenting with radiofrequency heating to restore body temperature, Hopps made an unexpected discovery: if a heart stopped beating due to cooling, it could be started again by artificial stimulation using mechanical or electrical means. In 1950, this led to Hopps’
