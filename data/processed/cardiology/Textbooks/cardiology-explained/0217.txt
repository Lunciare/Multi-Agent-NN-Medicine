EC: ejection click; EDM: early diastolic murmur; ESM: ejection systolic murmur; SLE: systemic lupus erythematosus. • The apex beat is sustained and can be doubled due to an additional atrial component. • On auscultation, the second heart sound is single when the valve is calcified due to a lack of aortic component. The classic ejection systolic murmur, which can radiate to one or both carotids, is usually heard best over the aortic area. A soft, early diastolic murmur of aortic regurgitation (AR) often coexists. Investigation and management Echo is the diagnostic tool of choice for valve disease – in particular, Doppler measurement of valve gradients can quantify lesions. Significant hemodynamic changes do not occur until the aortic valve area has been reduced to a quarter of its normal size (the normal orifice is 3–4 cm2). AS is classed as: • mild if the area is >1.5 cm2 • moderate if the area
