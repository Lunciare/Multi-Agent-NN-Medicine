Cardiology

in mortality at 3 years), but is more cost-effective than other post-MI treatment interventions, such as thrombolytic therapy, coronary bypass surgery, and cholesterol-lowering drugs (though less cost-effective than smoking cessation programs). Effective cardiac rehabilitation is multilayered and involves permanent lifestyle changes – such as the incorporation of regular physical activity into everyday life – to improve the risk profile. The many components of rehabilitation are outlined in Table 8. Programs are usually run by specialist nurses and physiologists, together with a cardiologist. However, in the absence of a local formal program, most of the components can be managed in the community. The potential benefits are enormous. The dramatic effect of cardiac rehabilitation is thought to be due to improvements in lipid profile, endothelial function, body composition, autonomic tone, fibrinolysis, and psychological well-being. 74 Coronary artery disease Elements of a cardiac rehabilitation program Initial evaluation •medical history and examination •ECG •risk assessment •goal setting Low-fat diet: a diet high in fiber (>20 g/day), and low in fat (<10% of total amount of calories) and cholesterol (<300 mg/day) Management of lipid levels Management of hypertension Cessation of smoking Weight reduction: body mass index <25 kg/m2 Management of diabetes Psychosocial management •identify depression,
