transmitral flow or a decrease in the diastolic filling time. The most common manifestation is breathlessness, but a reduction in exercise tolerance or symptoms of right-sided congestion can also occur. The typical 153 Chapter 9 Figure 3.Mitral stenosis with left atrial dilatation. This figure shows a thickened mital valve arrow. The spontaneous contrast is a good illustration of the thrombogenicity of the blood in the left atrium. This is believed to be the first step before the formation of thrombi, which then result in emboli.
