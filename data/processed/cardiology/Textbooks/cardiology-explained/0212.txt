The typical cardiac action potential is also shown: a fast sodium current and slower calcium current depolarize cardiac cells. The plateau phase caused by calcium entry contributes to the long refractory period, which protects the heart from re-excitation. Measurements are usually taken from several intracardiac sites, allowing identification of sinus node function and recovery, sinoatrial conduction, AV nodal conduction, and triggered ventricular arrhythmias. Treatment is with radiofrequency stimulation, which can ablate accessory pathways or interrupt re-entry circuits.
