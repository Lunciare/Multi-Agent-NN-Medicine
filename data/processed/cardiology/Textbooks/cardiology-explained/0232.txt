left atrium versus left ventricle demonstrating the gradient between the two cavities (and therefore mitral stenosis), and (c) chest x-ray. become disabling. The 10-year survival rate is high for asymptomatic patients (>80%), but low for those with symptoms (0%–15%). Asymptomatic patients with mild MS (MV area >1.5 cm2) require no further evaluation and do not need to be followed up more than annually. Percutaneous and surgical therapy Decisions on therapy are made by joint consideration of symptoms and MV morphology (including hemodynamics and pulmonary artery pressure). Therapeutic options include MV repair (open/closed commissurotomy), MV replacement, and percutaneous valvotomy. 155 Chapter 9 Current recommendations for surgical therapy Percutaneous NYHA class II–IV symptoms, MVA <1.5 cm2, and no valvotomy LA thrombus or MR Asymptomatic patients, MVA ≤1.5 cm2, pulmonary hypertension (>50 mm Hg), and no LA thrombus or MR NYHA class III–IV symptoms, MVA ≤1.5 cm2, and at high surgical risk MV repair NYHA class III–IV symptoms, MVA ≤1.5 cm2, and one of the following: •percutaneous valvotomy is not available •LA thrombus is resistant to anticoagulation •an intraoperative decision on repair versus replacement will be made MV replacement NYHA class I–II symptoms, MVA ≤1 cm2, and severe pulmonary hypertension (>60 mm Hg)
