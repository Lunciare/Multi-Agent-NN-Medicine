Acute coronary syndromes: treatment Pharmacological agents The first-line treatment of any ACS is oxygen, aspirin, heparin, and b-blockade. Clopidogrel is an alternative to aspirin and diltiazem is an alternative to b-blockade. Low molecular-weight heparins have advantages over heparin, such as: • simple administration • better bioavailability • no requirement for monitoring • enhanced antifactor Xa activity • lower rates of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) Nitrates can be given intravenously for closer control of pain, unless there is hypotension or suspicion of a posterior infarction that needs higher filling pressures. Tolerance to nitrates occurs very quickly (24–36 hours) so the quicker the infusion can be weaned, the better. Opiate analgesia is also used for pain. In both cases, there may be benefit from GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors (see above). Patients with positive troponin levels should undergo immediate catheterization. Otherwise, patients should rest until they are pain-free. After 48 hours without pain, patients should undergo cardiac catheterization.
