atrium; LV: left ventricle; RA: right atrium; RV: right ventricle. QRS wave complex The three waves of the QRS complex represent ventricular depolarization. For the inexperienced, one of the most confusing aspects of ECG reading is the labeling of these waves. The rule is: if the wave immediately after the P wave is an upward deflection, it is an R wave; if it is a downward deflection, it is a Q wave: • small Q waves correspond to depolarization of the interventricular septum. Q waves can also relate to breathing and are generally small and thin. They can also signal an old myocardial infarction (in which case they are big and wide) • the R wave reflects depolarization of the main mass of the ventricles – hence it is the largest wave • the S wave signifies the final depolarization of the ventricles, at the base of the heart 20 Conquering the ECG I aVR V1 V4 II aVL V2 V5 III aVF V3 V6 Figure 6.
