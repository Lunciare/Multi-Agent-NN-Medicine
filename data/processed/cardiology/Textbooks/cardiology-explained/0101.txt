5-to 7-times more expensive than streptokinase and thus only tend to be used in the following situations: • where streptokinase has been administered previously • where recent proven streptococcal throat infections have occurred • in cases of hypotension However, even with large anterior MI in younger patients presenting within 4 hours (a situation where tPA is often recommended first-line), the absolute added mortality benefit is only 1% above streptokinase. Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) can be an important complication of thrombolysis. Since heparin is associated with an increased risk of ICH (streptokinase treatment 70 Coronary artery disease has a lower rate of ICH when it is administered without heparin), there is particular concern with respect to the administration of tPA (as it is usually given with heparin) to hypertensive patients above 65 years of age who are less than 70 kg in weight. Partly as a result of these concerns, several centers have explored the use of low-dose thrombolytic treatment in combination with GPIIb/IIIa inhibition. The results of these trials have been encouraging. Recanalization is achieved following thrombolysis in approximately 70% of cases (compared with 15% of cases without thrombolysis). As this leaves a significant minority needing further attention, all patients should
