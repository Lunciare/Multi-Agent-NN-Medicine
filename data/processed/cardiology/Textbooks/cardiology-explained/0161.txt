Cardiology

more technological there is less focus on patients and more on their lesions and the tools used to treat them. Generalists are almost certainly better than cardiologists at practising holistic care. Unfortunately, conventional drugs for the treatment of heart failure do not adequately control the most common symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea. The latter is the most common distressing symptom in refractory heart failure. Maintaining a very close control of plasma volume is facilitated by regular weighing and adjustment of diuresis, but this rarely provides full symptom control. Fortunately, relief is possible through the use of opiates. These drugs reduce preload and afterload, dampen the central respiratory drive, and relieve distress through a central narcotic action. Thus, they are well suited for use in this situation. Drawbacks, such as tolerance and dependence, should not deter their use as studies suggest that they are minimal in this setting. Physical dependence is inevitable, but only relevant in the case of discontinuation of therapy, in which case it can be managed by gradual withdrawal. Morphine can be given at a dose of 2.5mg 4 hourly and as required, with the 4-hourly dose readjusted after 48 hours to take account of interim dosing. Control
