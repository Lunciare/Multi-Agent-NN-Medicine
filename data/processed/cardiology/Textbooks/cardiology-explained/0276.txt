Preparticipation screening for sport HCM is occasionally discovered during preparticipation screening for sport, and should be considered when a young athlete presents with voltage criteria LVH. In this situation, the question as to when to refer for echocardiography arises.The most common voltage criterion is that of Sokolow–Lyon (SV1 + RV5 >3.5 mV) (see Chapter 3, Conquering the ECG). Although the vast majority of young athletes in this category will have a normal heart, most cardiologists would recommend that any young, normotensive patient who meets these voltage criteria should be referred for an echo. The ECG and echo are the key diagnostic tools. However, the overall prevalence of relevant conditions (0.2%) makes these cost-ineffective. Approximately 200 screenings are required to detect one abnormality, while 200,000 are needed to prevent one death. Thus, it is important to
