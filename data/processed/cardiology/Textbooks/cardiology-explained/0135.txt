Cardiology

drugs qualifies the patient as “resistant”. Resistant hypertensives commonly suffer plasma volume expansion, despite the absence of clinical signs. In this situation, a more aggressive diuretic therapy can achieve targets where other combinations have failed to do so. Secondary causes are common in resistant hypertensives – they should be referred to a specialist to ensure a full diagnostic work-up. Apparent therapeutic failure could be due to noncompliance; many patients who have been prescribed several different tablets for an asymptomatic condition respond by not taking all of the tablets as directed. Therefore, before altering the medication, determine whether the patient is actually taking it. Malignant (or accelerated phase) hypertension In about 1% of patients with hypertension, the condition follows an accelerated course. BP is markedly raised (diastolic >130 mm Hg) and is associated with grade III–IV retinopathy. There may be encephalopathy (headache, confusion, visual disturbance, seizures, and coma), cardiac failure, and rapidly deteriorating renal function. The vascular lesion associated with malignant hypertension is fibrinoid necrosis of the walls of small arteries and arterioles. The prognosis is very 90 Hypertension poor: untreated, 90% of patients die within 1 year, and even with treatment the 5-year survival rate is only 60%. Malignant hypertension
