Cardiology

screening of the aortic root and prophylactic replacement should be considered when the diameter reaches 55 mm (a normal diameter is 40 mm). Beta-blockade can retard the rate of dilatation, but patients who do not have the replacement die in the fourth or fifth decade from aortic dissection or cardiac failure secondary to aortic regurgitation. Sinus of Valsalva A congenital aneurysm of the sinus of Valsalva is a rare cause of arteriovenous shunt. It is formed because of a weak connection between the aortic valve and the aortic fibrous ring. This enlarges during childhood and usually ruptures in adulthood into the right ventricle, creating a volume shunt from the left to the right side of the heart. The diagnosis is confirmed by aortography. Without surgical repair, biventricular failure results. Aortic dissection Dissection, which is usually caused by atherosclerosis, is the development of a tear in the aortic intima that creates a false lumen through the aortic media for a variable distance (see Figures 2 and3). 191 Chapter 12 Type A Type B Figure 3.
