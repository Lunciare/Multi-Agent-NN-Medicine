or Marfan’s syndrome are more likely to be responsible. Symptoms result from the acute painful tear felt as central chest pain, which radiates to the back, and from the compression of surrounding structures: • dysphagia (esophagus) • dyspnea (bronchi; pericardial effusion) • upper thorax/neck swelling (superior vena cava) Standard radiology and echocardiography can be useful in monitoring the progression of aneurysms. Computed tomography (CT) is the gold standard and should be carried out annually in patients with known disease that does not yet require surgery or percutaneous placement of an aortic prosthesis/stents. However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is increasingly being used. Management The central feature of management is rigorous control of blood pressure (BP). Therapy should include a b-blocker and be aimed at keeping systolic pressure <120mm Hg. Marfan’s syndrome Described by Bernard Marfan in 1896, this autosomal dominant single-gene disorder results from a mutation of the fibrillin gene on chromosome 15. The key clinical features are: • arachnodactyly (long spindly fingers) • high-arched palate • pectus excavatum 189 Chapter 12 Aortic arch Aneurysm Ascending aorta Descending aorta Figure 1.A typical aneurysm of the thoracic aorta at surgery.
