is invalid to diagnose MVP on the 4-chamber view at all. Paraprosthetic regurgitation Although metal valves stop ultrasound completely, echo is a useful tool for studying prosthetic valve function. The TEE approach is often used. Infective endocarditis Echo is the key investigation in infective endocarditis and, although a low threshold for TEE is warranted by its higher detection rate, transthoracic echo can demonstrate vegetations in approximately 70% of cases (see Chapter 10, Infective endocarditis). Embolic sources The primary cardiac sources for embolism are: • an akinetic ventricular segment • an LV aneurysm • the atrial appendage These are best visualized with TEE. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Although hypertrophy is variable, echo remains the screening tool of choice in suspected cases. The classic features are asymmetrical hypertrophy of the interventricular septum and anterior movement of the MV in systole. LV function is normal, and there may be dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction. 42 Understanding the echocardiogram Further reading Chambers JB. Clinical Echocardiography. London: BMJ Books, 1995.
