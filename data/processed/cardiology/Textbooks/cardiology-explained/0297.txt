when the patient develops high pulmonary vascular resistance, breathlessness, fatigue, and cyanosis. There is progression to effort syncope, recurrent hemoptysis, and heart failure. 203 Chapter 14 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 VSD PDA Pulm so tn ea nr oy sis ASD Coarctation aBi orc tiu cs p vi ad lve F ta el tl ro at l’s ogy TGA Figure 1. The relative incidence of common congenital heart defects. ASD: atrial septal defect; PDA: patent ductus arteriosus; TGA: transposition of the great arteries; VSD: ventricular septal defect. Recognizing VSD In VSD patients, the apex beat may be hyperdynamic and there could be a systolic thrill. The classic sign is a loud pansystolic murmur, often accompanied by a mid diastolic murmur at the apex (due to high flow through the mitral valve) (see Table 1). In patients with raised pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) is evident and the pulmonary second sound might be accentuated, followed by the early diastolic murmur of pulmonary regurgitation. With small VSDs, the electrocardiogram (ECG)is normal. With larger ones, there is evidence of biventricular enlargement (tall R waves and deep S waves in leads V1–V6), especially when pulmonary vascular resistance is high.
