and forth for up to 5seconds (check for bruits first) • Valsalva maneuver – the patient should take a deep breath, then attempt to exhale forcefully against a closed glottis for up to 15seconds 124 Arrhythmia I aVR V1 V4 II aVL V2 V5 III aVF V3 V6 Figure 13.Electrocardiogram of atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia. • diving reflex – this vestigial reflex, which allows marine animals to lower their metabolism when diving underwater, exists in humans and can increase vagal tone. Suddenly immerse the patient’s face in very cold water In a number of patients, the tachycardia (ie, AVNRT) terminates spontaneously with these maneuvers. However, if it does not, you should consider an adenosine challenge. This procedure involves rapid IV injections of increasing doses of adenosine (3–16mg). Adenosine has a very short half-life (10seconds) and produces temporary AV block, which can interrupt re-entry. This procedure is also very useful diagnostically, as the transient AV block can unmask an underlying atrial rhythm. The use of a short-acting b-blocker (eg, esmolol) or a calcium-channel blocker (eg,verapamil) has also been found to be safe and effective in terminating AVNRT. Verapamil is particularly useful in patients with asthma, in whom adenosine is contraindicated. Symptomatic
