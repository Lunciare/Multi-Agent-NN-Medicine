Cardiology

standard ECG uses 10 cables to obtain 12 electrical views of the heart. The different views reflect the angles at which electrodes “look” at the heart and the direction of the heart’s electrical depolarization. Limb leads Three bipolar leads and three unipolar leads are obtained from three electrodes attached to the left arm, the right arm, and the left leg, respectively. (An electrode is also attached to the right leg, but this is an earth electrode.) The bipolar limb leads reflect the potential difference between two of the three limb electrodes: • lead I: right arm–left arm • lead II: right arm–left leg • lead III: left leg–left arm The unipolar leads reflect the potential difference between one of the three limb electrodes and an estimate of zero potential – derived from the remaining two limb electrodes. These leads are known as augmented leads. The augmented leads and their respective limb electrodes are: • aVR lead: right arm • aVL lead: left arm • aVF lead: left leg 16 Conquering the ECG aVR (-150˚) aVL (-30˚) I (0˚) III (+120˚) II (+60˚) aVF (+90˚) Figure 2.The limb leads looking at the heart in a vertical plane.
