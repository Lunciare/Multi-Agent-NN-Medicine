assessment Exercise electrocardiography Exercise ECG is the mainstay test for the diagnosis of CAD. It is usually carried out on a treadmill, but bicycle exercise can also be used. The patient exercises according to a set protocol from rest to maximum exertion, which should be reached in 8–12 minutes. The protocol most commonly used was originally described by Robert Bruce and bears his name (see Figure 5). There are, however, good reasons to consider a protocol that is individualized for each patient.

The patient starts exercising at a speed of 2.7km/h on a gradient of 10%. The workload is intensified every 3 minutes by increasing the speed and the incline of the treadmill, until the endpoint is achieved. (b)The modified Bruce exercise protocol is less intense to start with and is used to assess frailer patients, such as the elderly or those who have suffered a
