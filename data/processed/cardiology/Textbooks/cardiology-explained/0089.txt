in 1929 and, although he catheterized only one patient’s heart, he went on to catheterize his own heart another eight times. 63 Chapter 5 Contrast flow TIMI grade Prompt anterograde flow and rapid clearing 3 Slowed distal filling but full opacification of distal vessel 2 Small amount of flow but incomplete opacification of distal vessel 1 No contrast flow 0 Table 6.System (devised by the TIMI [Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction] investigators) used to grade the flow of contrast dye that has been injected into coronary arteries during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Other, less common percutaneous techniques include radioactive stents and atherectomy (where the atheroma is physically removed from the artery). Insertion of a metal object into an artery is a prothrombotic event. Hence, stenting is carried out in conjunction with antithrombotic therapy. Infusional antithrombotic agents (eg, abciximab – see below) are used as an adjunct during angioplasty while oral antiplatelet agents, such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel, are used for 1 month post stent. (However, ticlopidine has been plagued by problems of bone marrow suppression.) Abciximab – a chimeric murine–human Fab1fragment monoclonal antibody – and the small molecule inhibitors tirofiban and eptifibatide are members of a new class of antithrombotics. These
