a visit to the doctor. Fatigue, slight dyspnea, and effort syncope occur with severe narrowing. The physical signs depend on the severity of the obstruction and secondary effects on RV function. In severe stenosis, the arterial pulse is small and the jugular venous pulse exhibits a large “a” wave. On palpation, there is nearly always a systolic thrill in the second left intercostal space and there is a left parasternal heave. An early systolic 209 Chapter 14 “ejection” click and a loud ejection murmur are best heard in the second intercostal space. The second sound is normal in mild cases, but in more severe cases it is widely split and the second (pulmonary) element is soft. ECG shows RVH in severe stenosis, while CXR shows a dilated pulmonary trunk with oligemic lung fields. Balloon valvotomy is indicated in severe pulmonary stenosis. Surgical valvotomy is an alternative. Patent ductus arteriosus Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) describes a preservation of the connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta that exists in the fetus (see Figure 8). Since aortic diastolic pressure is higher than pulmonary artery systolic pressure, there is continuous flow into the pulmonary circulation, creating the characteristic continuous (“machinery”) murmur, heard
