imaging, ultrasound waves in the range of 4–7MHz are used (intravascular ultrasound uses frequencies as high as 30 MHz). These are created within the ultrasound probe by striking piezo-electric crystals with an electric pulse, which stimulates the crystals to release sound waves. The central principle of ultrasound imaging is that, while most waves are absorbed by the body, those at interfaces between different tissue densities are reflected. In addition to emitting the ultrasound waves, the transducer detects the returning waves, processes the information, and displays it as characteristic images. Higher frequency ultrasound waves increase resolution, but decrease tissue penetration. Imaging modes There are three basic “modes” used to image the heart: • two-dimensional (2D) imaging • M-mode imaging • Doppler imaging Two-dimensional imaging 2D imaging is the mainstay of echo imaging and allows structures to be viewed moving in real time in a cross-section of the heart (two dimensions). It is used for detecting abnormal anatomy or abnormal movement of structures. The most common cross-sectional views are the parasternal long axis, the parasternal short axis, and the apical view (see Figure 1). The gastric or subcostal and suprasternal views are also commonly used. 35 Chapter 4 (a) (b) (c) RV
