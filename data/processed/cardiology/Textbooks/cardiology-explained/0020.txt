Chest leads Another six electrodes, placed in standard positions on the chest wall, give rise to a further six unipolar leads – the chest leads (also known as precordial leads), V1–V6. The potential difference of a chest lead is recorded between the relevant chest electrode and an estimate of zero potential – derived from the average potential recorded from the three limb leads. Planes of view The limb leads look at the heart in a vertical plane (see Figure 2), whereas the chest leads look at the heart in a horizontal plane. In this way, a three-dimensional electrical picture of the heart is built up (see Table 1). 17 Chapter 3 PERFORMING DOGS British physiologist Augustus D Waller of St Mary’s Medical School, London, published the first human electrocardiogram in the British Medical Journalin 1888. It was recorded from Thomas Goswell, a technician in the laboratory, using a capillary
