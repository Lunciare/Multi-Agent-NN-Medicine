Cardiology

provides an important source of information to guide those performing catheter ablation. The Maze procedure was designed to exclude any place in the atria where the macro re-entrant circuits that underlie AF can form. Until recently, this involved an extensive series of atrial incisions, but the more recent cryosurgical Maze is just as effective and technically less demanding. Atrial flutter Atrial flutter is a rapid, regular rhythm with atrial rates of 250–350 bpm. The ventricular response rate varies, but it is usually a 2:1 block (creating the classic 150 bpm regular ventricular rhythm). The ECG pattern is typical – classic flutter waves are positive in the inferior leads and negative in lead V1 (see Figure20). Overall, atrial flutter is managed very much like AF: • if the patient is hemodynamically compromised, one treatment option is DC cardioversion with low energy (50–100 J) • a relatively easy way to convert atrial flutter to SR in the hospital setting is to use overdrive pacing in the high right atrium (RA) • radiofrequency catheter ablation is now considered a curative approach in patients with recurrent atrial flutter. It can be eliminated by creating a linear lesion in the isthmus between the tricuspid annulus
