(distinct P waves, but with different morphologies) Regular narrow complex Sinus tachycardia Atrial flutter with constant AV block AVNRT Accessory pathway re-entrant tachycardia Irregular broad complex Atrial fibrillation + LBBB/RBBB Atrial fibrillation + other aberrant conduction Regular broad complex Sinus tachycardia + LBBB/RBBB Atrial flutter with constant AV block + LBBB/RBBB Ventricular tachycardia Table 5.Possible diagnoses of tachyarrhythmias based on the electrocardiogram. AV: atrioventricular; AVNRT: atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia; LBBB: left bundle branch block; RBBB: right bundle branch block. Figure 12.Electrocardiogram of atrial tachycardia. Atrioventricular nodal re-entrant tachycardia AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia (AVNRT) accounts for more than 70% of cases of paroxysmal SVT (see Figures 13 and 14). This is also termed “classic” SVT with fast (140–250 bpm) narrow complexes and no P waves. Initial management involves interventions to increase vagal tone. These should only be carried out on a monitored patient, and include: • carotid sinus massage – apply firm pressure to one carotid artery at the level of the upper thyroid cartilage and move a small distance back and forth for up to 5seconds (check for bruits first) • Valsalva maneuver – the patient should take a deep breath, then attempt to exhale forcefully against a closed glottis
