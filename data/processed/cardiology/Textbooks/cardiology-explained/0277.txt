prevalence of relevant conditions (0.2%) makes these cost-ineffective. Approximately 200 screenings are required to detect one abnormality, while 200,000 are needed to prevent one death. Thus, it is important to maximize the information available from history and examination (see Table 2). There is consensus that history and physical examination are the only cost-effective screening tools for sudden cardiac death in athletes. However, these are very poor at identifying the primary causes of sudden death: • HCM in its nonobstructive form (~35%) produces no murmur (see Figure 3) • coronary artery abnormalities (~20%) are not detectable by simple clinical examination 185 Chapter 11 Figure 3.Hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. Note the grossly hypertrophied interventricular septum. ECG patterns are distinctly abnormal (LVH, inverted T waves, deep Q waves, axis deviation, or LBBB) in about 15% of athletes, and mildly abnormal (borderline LVH, flat T wave, long PR interval, right bundle branch block) in another 25%. Early repolarization may account for another 15%. Bradycardia <60 bpm is found in more than a third. Abnormalities are most common in males younger than 20 years who are involved in endurance sports such as cycling, rowing, and cross-country skiing. In one series, 5% of over 1,000 consecutively examined
