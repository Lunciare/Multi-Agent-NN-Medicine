LDL and circulating leukocytes penetrate the arterial wall at regions of high shear stress (turbulent flow). In its atherogenic oxidized form, LDL enters macrophages, converting them to foam cells in the process. Oxidized LDL also enhances the growth factor-mediated migration of monocytes and smooth muscle cells to the intima, where the latter differentiate to form the fibrous cap of the mature atherosclerotic plaque. Figure 11shows the layers of a vessel wall. As a result of our understanding of these processes, there is much experimental interest in factors that contribute to the attraction and adhesion of leukocytes (chemokines and adhesion molecules), the receptors that modulate LDL uptake (scavenger receptors), enzymes that degrade the cap (matrix metalloproteinases), and protective species (such as nitric oxide). With inflammation a central component of our current appreciation of atherosclerosis, there is much interest
