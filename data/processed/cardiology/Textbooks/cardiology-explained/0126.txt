central nervous system reflect a relatively nonspecific central site of action mediated primarily through a-adrenoceptor agonism (see Figure 2). It seems that 2 some of the adverse effects of these agents, which are also mediated through this pathway, can be avoided by the use of selective imidazoline type 1 receptoragents. Early results suggest these agents are well tolerated, with a dry mouth being the only frequently reported unwanted effect (13% at 3 weeks, 2% at 12 months). 85 Chapter 6 Methyldopa Clonidine Moxonidine Imidazoline α 2 receptors type 1 receptor agents Dry mouth Sedation Inhibition of sympathetic vasoconstrictors Figure 2.Centrally acting antihypertensives. Pharmacotherapy selection In the absence of compelling reasons to choose other medications, the first-line choice should remain a b-blocker or thiazide diuretic. These are the drugs for which clear evidence of mortality reduction exists. In addition, they are generally well tolerated. There are good reasons to consider b-blockers first in younger people and thiazides first in older people. However, the majority of patients will require more than one drug, and the choice should be rational. Here, synergistic action is important (see Figure 2). Good combinations are: • thiazides (which cause secondary hyperreninemia) and ACEIs or ARBs (which block
