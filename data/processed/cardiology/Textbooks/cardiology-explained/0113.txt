(eg, stress due to being in a traffic jam on the way to the clinic). Consequently, it is recommended that at least three readings are taken. The annual risk of death from cardiovascular disease (including stroke) or coronary artery disease can be calculated from the European Society of Cardiology tables or Framingham risk tables. Some bodies recommend that mild hypertensives should only be treated if their cardiovascular risk exceeds 2% per year. This consideration of individual risk is welcome, since until recently most clinical trials have involved head-to-head comparisons of monotherapy, whereas in practice most patients require combination therapy. Causes No cause is identified in 95% of hypertension patients. However, awareness of treatable causes is important, especially in younger patients in whom there is a higher probability of the hypertension being secondary to some other cause. Causes of secondary hypertension are outlined in Table 2. Assessment History History-taking is straightforward since, in most cases, hypertension is asymptomatic. However, symptoms can include headaches, transient ischemic attacks, mild visual disturbances, epistaxes, exertional dyspnea (if heart failure has developed), angina, claudication, weight gain (in Cushing’s syndrome), nocturia, and hematuria (with renal disease). A full drug history is important and must include pharmacologically active
