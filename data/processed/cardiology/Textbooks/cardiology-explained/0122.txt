the cardiovascular system (b -receptors). Peripheral vascular disease and bradycardia are relative 1 contraindications. In susceptible patients, heart block and heart failure may be initiated. The most commonly reported adverse effect is lethargy, and nightmares can occur with lipid-soluble b-blockers. As with all antihypertensives, erectile dysfunction (ED) is a problem. The best guide as to whether ED is iatrogenic is to determine whether the symptoms appeared suddenly. Nevertheless, b-blockers have significant advantages in patients with coexistent angina and anxiety, and also after MI. Diuretics Thiazide diuretics, such as bendrofluazide, are another class of agent for which randomized controlled trial evidence indicates an improvement in survival, and should be the first-line drug in the elderly and in those with systolic hypertension. They work by inhibiting NaCl reabsorption in the distal tubule. This initially leads to an increase in Na+loss and a reduction in plasma volume. However, the plasma volume soon recovers, leaving a reduced total peripheral resistance, for which the mechanism is unknown. Thiazide diuretics are widely used and very cheap, with a moderate side-effect profile (most commonly hypokalemia, dyslipidemia, and gout). Potassium levels should be checked regularly. Loop diuretics have a role to play in the place of thiazides when
