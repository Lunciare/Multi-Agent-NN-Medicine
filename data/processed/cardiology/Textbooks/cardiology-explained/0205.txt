Cardiology

Lead displacement can occur as a result of concurrent right-sided pathology, eg, RV dilatation or valve abnormalities, and can be detected by changes in threshold. Changes in impedance can point to deterioration of old wires or loss of insulation properties. Subclavian vein or superior vena cava occlusion is more common with multiple lead systems. Classic signs include unilateral superficial vein engorgement around the upper thorax, neck, and face. Erosion occasionally occurs if the pacemaker box becomes gradually more superficial. Unless it causes chronic pain, or erodes completely, it does not demand referral. Some patients move their own box back and forward under the skin (Twiddler’s syndrome). This can cause hemorrhage or lead breaks. Infection of the implantation site can be problematic and should be taken seriously. In the early stage, superficial redness of the skin or swelling around the box will be noticed. For this, standard treatment is indicated, eg, a skin swab, cloxacillin (flucloxacillin) (oral dosage, 500 mg four times daily). If the infection does not respond, or if you suspect deep infection for another reason, eg, marked constitutional symptoms, refer immediately. Infections resistant to antibiotic therapy demand box and lead extraction – a procedure not without difficulty or
