QRS complexes in V1–V6 are either positive or negative) • fusion beats • capture beats However, the key test is an adenosine challenge, which will interrupt an SVT but have no effect on VT. If VT is clear from the ECG or adenosine challenge has no effect and the patient is compromised, immediate DC cardioversion is needed. If there is time, a short-acting induction agent should be administered (or IV midazolam can be used). If the patient is losing consciousness, even this can be bypassed. Finally, if the patient loses their pulse, the cardiac arrest protocol should be immediately instituted (see Chapter 1, Cardiac arrest). If the patient is only mildly compromised or suffering recurrent episodes, other therapeutic options are: • IV amiodarone • IV magnesium • IV lidocaine (lignocaine) (no left ventricular [LV] dysfunction) • overdrive pacing (this needs a temporary wire. The stimulator rate is turned up above the VT rate [usually ×3] to “capture” ventricular depolarization, and then gradually turned down) 128 Arrhythmia Figure 17.Electrocardiogram showing torsades de pointes. The chronic investigation and management of VT will be carried out by a specialist (and probably a cardiologist with a special interest in electrophysiology). Investigation will center on
