also be drug-induced (see Table 4, p. 32). Once this occurs, the responsible drug needs to be discontinued. 29 Chapter 3 Congenital Acquired Jervell and Lange–Nielsen syndrome Amiodarone, sotalol Romano–Ward syndrome Flecainide Hypocalcemia Hypokalemia Hypomagnesemia Phenothiazines Tricyclic antidepressants Table 3.Causes of a long QT interval. Pattern combinations Digoxin A reverse tick ST depression is characteristic and does not indicate toxicity. Digoxin toxicity can result in dysrhythmia. Pulmonary embolism Sinus tachycardia is seen in many patients with pulmonary embolism. New right bundle branch block (RBBB) or right axis deviation with “strain” can also indicate PE. The classic SQ T is less common. I III III Hyperkalemia The absolute potassium level is less important than its rate of rise. ECG changes reflecting a rapid rise demand immediate action (see Figures 19–21). The level of danger increases as the ECG changes progress. The sequence generally follows the order: • tall, tented T waves (see Figure 19) • lengthening of the PR interval • reduction in the P-wave height • widening of the QRS complex (see Figure 20) • “sinus” wave QRS pattern (see Figure 21) A sinus-wave QRS should be treated immediately with calcium chloride, whilst hyperkalemia associated with lesser ECG changes can
