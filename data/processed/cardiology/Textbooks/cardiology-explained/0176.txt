more common occurrence is an isolated left or right bundle branch block. These are usually distinct from any problem with AV conduction (ie, they usually coexist with normal sinus rhythm [SR]). The patterns of the ECG are characteristic, but highly variable; the hallmark is a wide QRS complex. • In left bundle branch block (LBBB), the pattern is best detected in V6 where there is an “M” pattern, while in V1 there is a “W” pattern (see Figure 8). • In right bundle branch block (RBBB), the pattern is best detected in V1 where there is an RSR complex, while in V6 there is a QRS complex (see Figure 8). In fact, both LBBB and RBBB are found in the “normal” population. New LBBB is cause for concern, and if it can clearly be related to an acute episode of chest pain then it probably indicates MI. Both RBBB and LBBB probably indicate increased risk for cardiovascular disease; however, neither on its own is an indication for pacing. Fascicular block One confusing aspect of electrocardiology is the terminology used to describe blocks of the fascicles (see Figure 9). The confusion arises from the fact that the right bundleis included in
