(LVH), or diastolic dysfunction • exaggeration of normal – a tall, thin E wave with a small or absent A wave. This indicates restrictive cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, or infiltrative cardiac disease (eg, amyloidosis) Diastolic dysfunction A normal LV ejection fraction in the presence of the heart failure syndrome leads to a search for diastolic dysfunction. Typical echo findings in diastolic dysfunction are normal LV cavity size, thickened ventricle, and reversed E/A ratio. Wall-motion abnormality When ischemia occurs, contractile abnormalities of segments of the myocardium can be detected by echo prior to the appearance of electrocardiogram (ECG) changes or symptoms. Therefore, echo can be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of 40 Understanding the echocardiogram Mild or no aortic stenosis Severe aortic stenosis Area of effective >1 <0.6 orifice (cm2) Velocity across <3 >4 valve (m/s) Gradient of pressure 0–60 >60 drop (mm Hg) Table 2.Echo characteristics of aortic stenosis. both stable coronary artery disease (via stress echo) and acute myocardial infarction. In the former situation, it offers localization of the ischemic region where the ECG cannot; in the latter, it offers some measure of the extent of the infarct and a screen for complications, such as ventricular septal defect (VSD).
