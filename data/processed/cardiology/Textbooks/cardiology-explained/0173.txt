considered abnormal when symptomatic hypotension is reproduced (Bezold–Jarisch reflex). Treatment Therapy to prevent recurrent vasovagal syncope has included the use of b-blockers and vagolytics (eg, disopyramide). Atrioventricular block AV block occurs when the electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles is delayed or blocked. 117 Chapter 8 First-degree AV block This is where there is a prolonged PR interval of >200 milliseconds (5 small squares; see Figure 4). No specific therapy is required and the prognosis is excellent. However, it can be a marker for an underlying problem such as myocarditis, MI, degenerative disease, or, most commonly, a drug effect (eg, tricyclic antidepressants). Second-degree AV block This is divided into two types: • type I (Mobitz I or Wenckebach AV block) • type II (Mobitz II AV block) Type I occurs when there is a repeated pattern of progressive prolongation of the PR interval, which eventually results in the failure of conduction of one atrial beat (see Figure 5). The cause is usually benign, but it can be a marker for the same underlying cardiac problems as first-degree AV block. In most cases, treatment is unnecessary. Routine prophylactic permanent pacing is not recommended unless the patient is symptomatic with
