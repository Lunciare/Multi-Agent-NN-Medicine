timeline on his ECG diagrams and, of course, P is the letter that follows O. If the image of the PQRST diagram was striking enough to be adopted by researchers as a true representation of the underlying form, it would have been logical to continue the same naming convention when the more advanced string galvanometer started creating ECGs a few years later.

Our aim then is not to explain how to carry out echocardiography, but how to realize its potential and limitations. Background “Ultra” sound has a frequency above the range audible by humans (ie, >20,000 Hz). For adult cardiac imaging, ultrasound waves in the range of 4–7MHz are used (intravascular ultrasound uses frequencies as high as 30 MHz). These are created within the ultrasound probe by striking piezo-electric crystals
