general population. The shape of the complex is highly variable and depends on the ventricular source. Their significance is debated. They can be a marker of coronary disease and increased risk, but, without a precipitating cause, treatment generally does not lower risk. Electrolyte abnormalities should be excluded. If ventricular ectopics appear frequently during exercise (eg, an exercise tolerance test), the patient should be investigated further for coronary artery disease. Torsades de pointes This is a form of polymorphic VT that occurs when the SR shown on an ECG has a prolonged QT interval. The ECG exhibits a continuously changing axis (hence, “turning of points”; see Figure 17), which can look like ventricular fibrillation (VF). The prolonged QT interval can be caused by: 129 Chapter 8 Definition Duration of atrial fibrillation Paroxysmal Up to 7 days Persistent Longer than 7 days Permanent Cardioversion failed or not attempted Table 6.Classification of atrial fibrillation. • antiarrhythmic agents • hypokalemia • hypomagnesemia • bradycardia However, in very rare cases it may be congenital (Jervell and Lange–Nielsen syndrome or Romano–Ward syndrome). Atrial fibrillation AF is the single most common cardiac arrhythmia. It is a condition where there is disorganized electrical and mechanical activity of the
