on monotherapy, whilst one third require three or more drugs. Knowledge of the mechanisms of action of antihypertensives is important as it allows rational combinations to be chosen based on complementary mechanisms of action. There are four major groups of drug treatments for hypertension and several less frequently used classes. The sites of action of these antihypertensive agents are shown in Figure 1. 82 Hypertension Figure 1. Major physiological mechanisms of antihypertensives. See Figure 2for details of centrally acting hypertensives. ACE: angiotensin-converting enzyme; AT: angiotensin. Beta-blockers Beta-adrenoreceptor blockers have been used for many decades in the treatment of hypertension and are one of the few classes of agents that have been proven to reduce mortality. They work by reducing cardiac output via negative inotropic and chronotropic actions. In addition, they block sympathetic nervous system stimulation of renin release by juxtaglomerular cells. As with all medications, their 83 Chapter 6 use is limited primarily by adverse effects. Asthma is generally considered to be an absolute contraindication, even with agents selective for the cardiovascular system (b -receptors). Peripheral vascular disease and bradycardia are relative 1 contraindications. In susceptible patients, heart block and heart failure may be initiated. The most commonly reported adverse
