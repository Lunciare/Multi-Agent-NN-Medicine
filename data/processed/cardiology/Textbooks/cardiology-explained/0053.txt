of coronary plaques exists – from stable (lipid-poor, thick fibrous cap) to unstable (lipid-rich, thin fibrous cap) (see Figure 1). When an unstable plaque ruptures – and the more unstable it is, the more likely it is to rupture – the subsequent release of prothrombotic and vasoconstrictive factors increases the likelihood of complete occlusion of the artery. It is the balance between the body’s prothrombotic and thrombolytic pathways at the rupture site that determines the clinical outcome. Transient occlusion leads to ischemia and pain; permanent occlusion leads to transmural MI (see Table 1). THROMBOSIS IN MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION The hypothesis that thrombosis plays a central role in myocardial infarction was first proposed by James Herrick in JAMAin 1912. This paper was the first to suggest that clots, rather than a slow accretion of plaque, are responsible for the complete occlusion that would often result in death. Importantly, he was the first to link symptoms in living patients with coronary artery disease, and to suggest that patients can survive complete blockage. These ideas were radical and new and (not surprisingly) no one believed him. 45 Chapter 5 Stable Unstable Ruptured Abundant Thick fibrous Abundant Thin fibrous smooth cap macrophages cap Fibrin muscle
