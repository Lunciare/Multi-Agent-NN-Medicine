Other forms of angina include: • variant angina (also known as Prinzmetal’s angina), which causes an unpredictable pain – typically coming on at rest – and is associated with transient ST elevation on an ECG. It is thought to be due to coronary spasm and seems to be independent of atherosclerosis • syndrome X – a condition in which the history is typical of coronary disease and there is ST depression on exercise, yet the coronary arteries are angiographically normal. It is thought to reflect small vessel disease and/or abnormal ventricular function • dyspnea– angina can present as exertional dyspnea. Pay close attention to the pattern of onset and relief • silent ischemia – diabetics, an important subgroup, can suffer from silent ischemia and even silent MI. Thus, even if there are no apparent symptoms of cardiac disease, a diabetic with an ECG abnormality should undergo stress testing and echocardiography to determine whether there is any indication for catheterization. One view is that all diabetics of
