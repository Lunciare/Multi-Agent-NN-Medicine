Mild to moderate obstruction can be managed conservatively throughout pregnancy, whereas those with severe disease (eg, gradient >50 mm Hg, LV function likely to be normal) should be advised to delay conception until treatment is obtained. Aortic regurgitation AR can usually be managed medically with a combination of diuretics and vasodilator therapy. As with MR, surgery should be contemplated during pregnancy for the control of class III–IV symptoms.
