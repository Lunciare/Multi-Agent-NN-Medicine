The top chain represents actin; the bottom chain represents myosin. Contraction occurs when calcium binds the troponin complex, allowing myosin to bind to actin with the production of force: “Myosin rows the actin sea”.

Clearly, this cannot be a useful diagnostic marker during life, and increasing attention is being given to molecular genetic diagnostic tools. Regardless of the electrocardiogram (ECG) presentation, the prognosis for HCM patients can be unpredictable. Some with severe hypertrophy remain asymptomatic, while others with apparently less severe hypertrophy develop arrhythmias, increased ventricular stiffness, heart failure, or sudden death. Indeed, there can be considerable variation in phenotype within families (see Figure 2). 182 Cardiomyopathy This much
