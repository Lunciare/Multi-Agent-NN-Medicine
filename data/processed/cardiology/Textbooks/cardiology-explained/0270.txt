Figure1 and Table 1). Despite dramatic improvements in the knowledge and understanding of HCM, challenges and controversies still exist regarding its diagnosis, etiology, natural history, and management. For example, many HCM patients do not, in fact, have left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The shifting understanding of this complex disease can make terminology difficult. However, “hypertrophic cardiomyopathy” is the preferred expression for this condition. This nomenclature avoids the term “idiopathic subaortic stenosis” or inclusion of the word “obstructive”, which imply left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (present in only 25% of cases). It also excludes secondary causes of LVH. The classic features of HCM are asymmetrical LVH with a normal or small left ventricular cavity. However, wall thickness varies considerably. The majority of clearly identified patients have an unmistakably abnormal left ventricular mass. This averages at a septal thickness of 20–22 mm, but can be up to 60 mm (see Figure2). This leaves a significant minority of patients in whom there will be diagnostic ambiguity with respect to cardiac morphology. In fact, the hallmark of the disease is 181 Chapter 11 α-Tropomyosin Troponin T Troponin I Troponin C Myo psi rn o- tb ei in nding Myosin light chain Myosin Myosin heavy head
