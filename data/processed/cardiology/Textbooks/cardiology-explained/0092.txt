Cardiology

coronary angiogram was, in fact, carried out by mistake by Mason Sones of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, USA, in 1958. Carrying out a standard LV angiogram, he paused – leaving the catheter in the aorta – to have a midprocedure smoke with his second operator. He returned, and relying on a pressure reading rather than direct visualization to determine the position of the catheter, he injected the RCA instead of the left ventricle. Realizing the mistake immediately from the outline of the RCA on the fluoroscope screen, he rapidly removed the catheter – just as his patient arrested. Hesitating, with scalpel in hand prepared for open chest defibrillation, he noticed the rhythm was asystole and not ventricular fibrillation. Thinking he might be able to help clear the dye without resorting to direct application of the paddles onto the myocardium, he pounded his patient’s chest shouting “Cough! Cough!” Perhaps it was a cough, or maybe the precordial thump, or perhaps even its repeated applicationa that restarted the patient’s heart, but certainly the fact that the patient recovered was the spark that ignited a revolution in diagnostic medicine.
