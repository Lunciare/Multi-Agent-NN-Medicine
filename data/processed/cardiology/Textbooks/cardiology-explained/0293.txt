associated with a characteristic jugular venous pressure (JVP). Kussmaul’s sign describes a raised JVP that rises further on inspiration, while Friedrich’s sign describes a steep x/y descent (although, in reality at the bedside, the waves are hard to discern). The heart sounds are quiet and there may be a rub. 199 Chapter 13 KUSSMAUL’S LEGACY Adolph Kussmaul was Professor of Medicine successively at Heidelberg, Erlangen, Freiburg, and Strasbourg. As well as describing the paradoxical increase in JVP on inspiration in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy, right ventricular failure, and constrictive pericarditis, he described the deep-sighing respiration associated with low arterial pH (Kussmaul breathing) and coined the term “polyarteritis nodosa”. In fact, Kussmaul’s JVP sign is widely misunderstood to be solely the result of right ventricular incompliance, when in fact the explanation relates as much to distension of the mesenteric vascular bed and the change from a right ventricular pressure that predominantly reflects negative intrapleural pressure “sucking” blood into the chest, to one that predominantly reflects positive intra- abdominal pressure “pushing” the greater volume proximally. A characteristic of cardiac tamponade is pulsus paradoxus, which is not paradoxical at all, but an exaggeration of the normal drop in systolic pressure on inspiration –
