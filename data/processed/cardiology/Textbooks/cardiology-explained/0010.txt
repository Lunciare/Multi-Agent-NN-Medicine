Palpation Before auscultation, inspection of the precordium can be a useful indicator of previous surgery – eg, midline sternotomy suggests previous bypass, lateral thoracotomy suggests previous mitral valve or minimally invasive bypass surgery (left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery). Locate the apex beat – the furthest point laterally and inferioraly where you can clearly feel the apex (usually the fifth intercostal space in the midclavicular line). There are many different descriptions for abnormal apex beats. One scheme distinguishes heaving (high afterload, eg, aortic stenosis) from thrusting (high preload, 9 Chapter 2 eg, aortic regurgitation). The apex may also be “tapping”, but this reflects a loud first heart sound. In addition, you should place your left hand over the sternum and feel for any significant ventricular heave (right ventricular hypertrophy) or thrill (tight aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defect). Auscultation Held by many as the key to physical examination, the importance of auscultation remains, but is diminished in an age of increasingly portable echocardiography. Listen over the aortic (second right intercostal space) and pulmonary (second left intercostal space) areas and at the
