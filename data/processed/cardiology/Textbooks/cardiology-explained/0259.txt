Cardiology

septal defect (VSD), bicuspid aortic valve, and coarctation of the aorta. Vegetations occur when a high-pressure jet enters a low-pressure cavity through a narrow orifice. This explains why endocarditis complicates a small VSD, but is not associated with a large VSD, mitral stenosis, or an atrial septal defect. In the presence of a VSD, vegetations can be found on the right ventricular side of the VSD, on the tricuspid valve, or where the jet impinges on the right ventricular wall. Vegetations found in coarctation usually occur distal to the obstruction. 172 Infective endocarditis Finally, in children, cyanotic heart disease is still the most common cause of endocarditis, and the risk does not diminish after surgical repair as prostheses carry their own risk. Prosthetic valve endocarditis A special subset of endocarditis is that affecting prosthetic valves. This is traditionally divided into early onset (within 60 days of surgery) or late onset. Early onset usually results from perioperative valve contamination with staphylococci, whereas the etiology of late prosthetic valve endocarditis resembles native valve infection, usually due to streptococci.
