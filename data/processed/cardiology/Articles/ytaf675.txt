Background Residual shunts after tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair are rare and can stem from residual defects, unrecognized VSDs, or, rarely,
acquired coronary cameral fistulas (CCFs). Correctly distinguishing these is vital since treatments differ.
.............................................................................................................................................................................................
Case summary Two paediatric cases following TOF repair are described: one shows features of an acquired CCF with continuous flow from the
coronary artery into the right ventricle. Because of the low shunt fraction, asymptomatic presentation, and lack of guidelines for
definitive treatment, the patient is managed conservatively with regular monitoring. The other case, though asymptomatic, demon-
strates a significant residual VSD with holosystolic flow; increased pulmonary blood flow and a significant shunt on cardiac cath-
eterization indicate the need for catheter closure.
.............................................................................................................................................................................................
Discussion Acquired CCF is a rare, usually asymptomatic complication managed conservatively, while residual VSDs may cause significant haemo-
dynamic issues requiring intervention. Echocardiography, assessing flow timing, jet origin, and haemodynamics, is key for differentiation.

Learning points
• Residual shunts after tetralogy of Fallot repair are rare and usually caused by residual or additional ventricular septal defects, or rarely, ac-
quired coronary cameral fistulas (CCFs).
• Acquired CCFs are uncommon, often iatrogenic, and usually haemodynamically insignificant. Systematic echocardiographic evaluation is cru-
cial for accurate diagnosis and management.
