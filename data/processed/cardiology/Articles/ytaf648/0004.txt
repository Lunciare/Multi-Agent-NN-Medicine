A 64-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer treated with chemotherapy presented with shortness of breath and cough over the past 5 months and was admitted due to a 2-week history of worsening dyspnoea and peripheral oedema. Transthoracic echocardiography found dilated right ventricle, interventricular septal flattening, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed no evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy demonstrated multiple wedge-shaped defects in the peripheral regions of both lungs. Right heart catheterization confirmed pre-capillary PH, and pulmonary angiography revealed vascular narrowing of the peripheral pulmonary arteries. Based on the radiological findings and the relatively slow clinical course, CTEPH was initially suspected. However, pulmonary wedge aspiration cytology—performed by aspirating a blood sample via a Swan–Ganz catheter from the wedged position during right heart catheterization—revealed tumour cells, confirming the diagnosis of PTTM rather than CTEPH. Because of the poor prognosis, the patient received palliative care and died 2 months later.

Discussion Pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy is a rare complication of malignancy that causes fatal PH. It is pathologically characterized by tumour cell embolization, activation of the coagulation system, and intimal proliferation, resulting in progressive vascular occlusion. While gastric cancer is most commonly associated with PTTM, pancreatic cancer–related cases are relatively rare. Antemortem diagnosis is challenging because lung biopsy is invasive and risky, and because PTTM and CTEPH share similar clinical features. Pulmonary wedge aspiration cytology using a Swan–Ganz catheter is a minimally invasive diagnostic method with high sensitivity and specificity and is particularly valuable in unstable patients. When feasible, it should be performed during RHC to obtain pathological confirmation and guide management decisions. In conclusion, PTTM is a progressive disease with poor prognosis that is difficult to diagnose antemortem and distinguish from CTEPH. Pulmonary wedge aspiration cytology using a Swan–Ganz catheter is a useful diagnostic tool that can facilitate accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
