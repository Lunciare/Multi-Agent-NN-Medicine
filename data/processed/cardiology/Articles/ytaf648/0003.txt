A 64-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer treated with chemotherapy presented with shortness of breath and cough over the past 5 months and was admitted due to a 2-week history of worsening dyspnoea and peripheral oedema. Transthoracic echocardiography found dilated right ventricle, interventricular septal flattening, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed no evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy demonstrated multiple wedge-shaped defects in the peripheral regions of both lungs. Right heart catheterization confirmed pre-capillary PH, and pulmonary angiography revealed vascular narrowing of the peripheral pulmonary arteries. Based on the radiological findings and the relatively slow clinical course, CTEPH was initially suspected. However, pulmonary wedge aspiration cytology—performed by aspirating a blood sample via a Swan–Ganz catheter from the wedged position during right heart catheterization—revealed tumour cells, confirming the diagnosis of PTTM rather than CTEPH. Because of the poor prognosis, the patient received palliative care and died 2 months later.

thrombus, and leg ultrasound showed no deep vein thrombosis. However, pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy demonstrated multiple wedge-shaped defects in the peripheral regions of both lungs. After 15 days of heart failure treatment, right heart catheterization (RHC) was performed with 1 L/min of oxygen, showing findings consistent with pre-capillary PH. Digital subtraction pulmonary angiography revealed vascular narrowing of the peripheral pulmonary arteries. Based on these findings and the relatively slow progression of respiratory failure, CTEPH was strongly suspected under a thrombogenic condition with cancer. Anticoagulation therapy with edoxaban was initiated, and referral to a specialized facility for balloon pulmonary angioplasty was considered. However, pulmonary wedge aspiration cytology performed during RHC revealed tumour cells, confirming PH caused by PTTM rather than CTEPH. The prognosis was estimated to be less than 1 year due to pathological Stage IV pancreatic cancer. The patient and her family opted for chemotherapy and palliative care without PH-specific treatment. She was discharged but re-admitted 2 months later due to severe respiratory failure caused by PTTM and died shortly thereafter. Discussion Pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy is a rare complication of malignancy that causes fatal PH. It is pathologically characterized by tumour cell embolization, activation of the coagulation system, and intimal
