Two paediatric cases following tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair are described. One case shows features of an acquired coronary cameral fistula (CCF) with continuous flow from the coronary artery into the right ventricle. Because of the low shunt fraction, asymptomatic presentation, and lack of guidelines for definitive treatment, the patient is managed conservatively with regular monitoring. The other case, though asymptomatic, demonstrates a significant residual ventricular septal defect (VSD) with holosystolic flow; increased pulmonary blood flow and a significant shunt on cardiac catheterization indicate the need for catheter closure.

Discussion Acquired CCF is a rare, usually asymptomatic complication managed conservatively, while residual VSDs may cause significant haemodynamic issues requiring intervention. Echocardiography, assessing flow timing, jet origin, and haemodynamics, is key for differentiation. Learning points • Residual shunts after tetralogy of Fallot repair are rare and usually caused by residual or additional ventricular septal defects, or rarely, acquired coronary cameral fistulas. • Acquired coronary cameral fistulas are uncommon, often iatrogenic, and usually haemodynamically insignificant. Systematic echocardiographic evaluation is crucial for accurate diagnosis and management. Introduction Residual shunts after tetralogy of Fallot repair are rare but clinically significant. They may arise from residual VSDs, unrecognized additional VSDs, or less commonly, acquired coronary cameral fistulas. Accurate differentiation is essential because management strategies differ substantially. Case 1 A 10-year-old boy with TOF underwent intracardiac repair with VSD closure and infundibular resection. Post-operative echocardiography showed a left-to-right shunt caused by an acquired coronary cameral fistula from the left anterior descending artery to the right ventricle, characterized by continuous flow, mainly during diastole. The shunt was haemodynamically insignificant, and the patient was managed conservatively. Case 2 An 8-year-old boy with TOF underwent staged surgical repair, including VSD closure and double-barrel outflow repair. Follow-up echocardiography revealed
