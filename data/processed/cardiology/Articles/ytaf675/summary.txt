Two paediatric cases following tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair are described. One case shows features of an acquired coronary cameral fistula (CCF) with continuous flow from the coronary artery into the right ventricle. Because of the low shunt fraction, asymptomatic presentation, and lack of guidelines for definitive treatment, the patient is managed conservatively with regular monitoring. The other case, though asymptomatic, demonstrates a significant residual ventricular septal defect (VSD) with holosystolic flow; increased pulmonary blood flow and a significant shunt on cardiac catheterization indicate the need for catheter closure.
