Two paediatric cases following tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair are described. One case shows features of an acquired coronary cameral fistula (CCF) with continuous flow from the coronary artery into the right ventricle. Because of the low shunt fraction, asymptomatic presentation, and lack of guidelines for definitive treatment, the patient is managed conservatively with regular monitoring. The other case, though asymptomatic, demonstrates a significant residual ventricular septal defect (VSD) with holosystolic flow; increased pulmonary blood flow and a significant shunt on cardiac catheterization indicate the need for catheter closure.

timing and character Continuous, mainly diastolic flow Holosystolic flow during systole only Location of shunt Originates from a coronary artery, usually draining into the right ventricle Originates from the left ventricle across the VSD patch into the right ventricle Echocardiography Continuous flow during systole and diastole Flow only during systole Electrocardiogram May show signs of left ventricular volume overload and ischaemia May show biventricular volume overload RV, right ventricle; LV, left ventricle; VSD, ventricular septal defect; CCF, coronary cameral fistula; rVSD, residual ventricular septal defect; LAD, left anterior descending artery.
