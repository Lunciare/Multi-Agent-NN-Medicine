Two paediatric cases following tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair are described. One case shows features of an acquired coronary cameral fistula (CCF) with continuous flow from the coronary artery into the right ventricle. Because of the low shunt fraction, asymptomatic presentation, and lack of guidelines for definitive treatment, the patient is managed conservatively with regular monitoring. The other case, though asymptomatic, demonstrates a significant residual ventricular septal defect (VSD) with holosystolic flow; increased pulmonary blood flow and a significant shunt on cardiac catheterization indicate the need for catheter closure.

was haemodynamically insignificant, and the patient was managed conservatively. Case 2 An 8-year-old boy with TOF underwent staged surgical repair, including VSD closure and double-barrel outflow repair. Follow-up echocardiography revealed a residual VSD with holosystolic flow originating from the left ventricle. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a significant shunt, and closure was recommended. Discussion Coronary cameral fistulas are rare anomalies that may be congenital or acquired, often following cardiac surgery. Most post-operative CCFs are small and managed conservatively, whereas haemodynamically significant residual VSDs require intervention. Echocardiographic assessment of shunt origin, flow timing, and haemodynamic impact is essential for accurate diagnosis. Conclusion Residual shunts after TOF repair may result from residual VSDs or acquired coronary cameral fistulas. Precise echocardiographic evaluation is critical, as management ranges from observation to surgical or catheter-based intervention. These cases highlight the importance of systematic imaging in identifying and managing uncommon post-operative complications.
