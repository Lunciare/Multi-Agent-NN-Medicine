BACKGROUND: CPT1 (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1) is a rate-limiting enzyme for long-chain fatty acid oxidation. In
adult hearts, CPT1b predominates, while CPT1a is coexpressed at lower levels. Pathological stress on the heart induces
CPT1a expression, coinciding with a reduction in fatty acid oxidation, yet the role of CPT1a in pathological remodeling
is unknown.
METHODS: CPT1 isoform expression was assayed in the myocardium of patients with heart failure with nonischemic
cardiomyopathy and a preclinical mouse model of heart failure. Mice were subjected to afterload stress via transverse aortic
constriction (TAC) or sham surgery (sham) with cardiac-specific CPT1a knockdown or cardiac-specific, adeno-associated
virus serotype 9 (AAV9)–mediated CPT1a overexpression (AAV9.cTnT [cardiac troponin T].Cpt1a) versus empty virus or
PBS infusions as controls. MicroRNA 370, known to suppress hepatic CPT1a, was assayed and overexpressed to determine
if microRNA 370 regulates cardiac CPT1a expression.
RESULTS: CPT1a protein was elevated and microRNA 370 reduced in the myocardium of male and female patients with
nonischemic cardiomyopathy, as well as in failing mouse hearts. AAV9–mediated microRNA 370 overexpression in mouse
hearts suppressed CPT1a expression and attenuated the response of CPT1a to TAC. Preventing CPT1a upregulation
in response to TAC in cardiac-specific CPT1a knockout mice exacerbated adverse remodeling, severe dysfunction, and
increased mortality. In contrast, CPT1a overexpression (2.8-fold) attenuated impaired ejection fraction (by 54%) versus
control TAC hearts (P<0.05). Delivery of AAV9.cTnT.Cpt1a 4 weeks after TAC surgery led to significant rescue of ejection
fraction and mitigated the exacerbated dysfunction of cardiac-specific CPT1a knockout mice TAC hearts. RNA-seq revealed
a novel function of CPT1a in suppressing hypertrophic, profibrotic, and cell death gene programs in both sham and TAC
hearts, irrespective of changes in fatty acid oxidation, with reduced histone acetylation.
CONCLUSIONS: The effects of CPT1a in the heart extend beyond fatty acid oxidation including noncanonical regulation of
gene programs. CPT1a upregulation occurs in nonischemic cardiomyopathy and is a critical cardioprotective adaptation to
pathological stress.
