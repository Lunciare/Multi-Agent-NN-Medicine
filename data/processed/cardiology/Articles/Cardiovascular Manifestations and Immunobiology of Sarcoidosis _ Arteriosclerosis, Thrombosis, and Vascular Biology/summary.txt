Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown cause that can affect the heart and blood vessels, causing cardiomyopathy, pulmonary hypertension, and vasculitis. The pathological hallmark of sarcoidosis is the formation of noncaseating granulomas consisting of monocytes and dendritic cells, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and T cells. Sarcoidosis has features of autoimmune disease, and many candidate self-epitopes have been identified, but experimental validation is lacking. There is a strong hereditary component associated with the human leukocyte antigen region on chromosome 6. Symptoms of the disease may be subtle and often go unrecognized by patients and practitioners. Catastrophic events, including sudden cardiac death caused by lethal arrhythmias, can be the initial manifestation of the disease. Diagnosis is challenging and limited by the lack of sensitive and specific diagnostic tools, which also hampers monitoring of disease activity. Here, we discuss the cardiovascular manifestations and underlying immunobiology of sarcoidosis. We also review current diagnostic and treatment approaches for cardiac sarcoidosis, as well as the challenges faced by patients and clinicians and opportunities for future research.
