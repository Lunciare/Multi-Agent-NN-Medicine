A 64-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer treated with chemotherapy presented with shortness of breath and cough over the past 5 months and was admitted due to a 2-week history of worsening dyspnoea and peripheral oedema. Transthoracic echocardiography found dilated right ventricle, interventricular septal flattening, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. Although contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed no evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism, pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy demonstrated multiple wedge-shaped defects in the peripheral regions of both lungs. Right heart catheterization confirmed pre-capillary PH, and pulmonary angiography revealed vascular narrowing of the peripheral pulmonary arteries. Based on the radiological findings and the relatively slow clinical course, CTEPH was initially suspected. However, pulmonary wedge aspiration cytology—performed by aspirating a blood sample via a Swan–Ganz catheter from the wedged position during right heart catheterization—revealed tumour cells, confirming the diagnosis of PTTM rather than CTEPH. Because of the poor prognosis, the patient received palliative care and died 2 months later.

Discussion

Pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy is a rare but fatal cause of PH and is rarely diagnosed antemortem. Pulmonary wedge aspiration cytology is a minimally invasive and valuable tool that helps differentiate PTTM from CTEPH and plays a crucial role in guiding both diagnosis and management.

Introduction
Case presentation

Pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) is a malignancy-associated disease that leads to fatal pulmonary hypertension (PH). Pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy is rarely diagnosed antemortem and is often difficult to distinguish from chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) due to their similar characteristics. We report a case of PTTM secondary to pancreatic cancer that was initially suspected as CTEPH, but ultimately diagnosed by pulmonary wedge aspiration cytology using a Swan–Ganz catheter.

A 64-year-old woman was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and lymph node metastases 4 months earlier and was treated with S-1 chemotherapy. She had also presented with dyspnoea and cough several months before being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed multiple ground-glass opacities in the subpleural regions of both lungs. Although these were initially suspected as lung metastases, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) demonstrated only slight radiotracer accumulations, and bronchoalveolar lavage cytology revealed no malignancy. Due to oxygen desaturation, she started home oxygen therapy at 1 L/min.

She was referred to our department with a 2-week history of progressive dyspnoea, cough, and peripheral oedema. Transthoracic echocardiography suggested right-sided heart failure caused by PH. She was treated with diuretics and continuous dobutamine infusion. Suspecting pulmonary thromboembolism, contrast-enhanced CT revealed no pulmonary thrombus, and leg ultrasound showed no deep vein thrombosis. However, pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy demonstrated multiple wedge-shaped defects in the peripheral regions of both lungs.

After 15 days of heart failure treatment, right heart catheterization (RHC) was performed with 1 L/min of oxygen, showing findings consistent with pre-capillary PH. Digital subtraction pulmonary angiography revealed vascular narrowing of the peripheral pulmonary arteries. Based on these findings and the relatively slow progression of respiratory failure, CTEPH was strongly suspected under a thrombogenic condition with cancer. Anticoagulation therapy with edoxaban was initiated, and referral to a specialized facility for balloon pulmonary angioplasty was considered.

However, pulmonary wedge aspiration cytology performed during RHC revealed tumour cells, confirming PH caused by PTTM rather than CTEPH. The prognosis was estimated to be less than 1 year due to pathological Stage IV pancreatic cancer. The patient and her family opted for chemotherapy and palliative care without PH-specific treatment. She was discharged but re-admitted 2 months later due to severe respiratory failure caused by PTTM and died shortly thereafter.

Discussion

Pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy is a rare complication of malignancy that causes fatal PH. It is pathologically characterized by tumour cell embolization, activation of the coagulation system, and intimal proliferation, resulting in progressive vascular occlusion. While gastric cancer is most commonly associated with PTTM, pancreatic cancer–related cases are relatively rare.

Antemortem diagnosis is challenging because lung biopsy is invasive and risky, and because PTTM and CTEPH share similar clinical features. Pulmonary wedge aspiration cytology using a Swan–Ganz catheter is a minimally invasive diagnostic method with high sensitivity and specificity and is particularly valuable in unstable patients. When feasible, it should be performed during RHC to obtain pathological confirmation and guide management decisions.

In conclusion, PTTM is a progressive disease with poor prognosis that is difficult to diagnose antemortem and distinguish from CTEPH. Pulmonary wedge aspiration cytology using a Swan–Ganz catheter is a useful diagnostic tool that can facilitate accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.
