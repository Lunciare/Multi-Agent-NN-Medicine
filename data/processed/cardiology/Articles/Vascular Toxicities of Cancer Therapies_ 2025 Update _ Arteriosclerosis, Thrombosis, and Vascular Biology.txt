Vascular Toxicities of Cancer Therapies: 2025 Update | Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology
Abstract
Advances in cancer therapies have transformed many malignancies into chronic or manageable conditions, but have been linked to adverse, including cardiovascular, events. Vascular toxicities associated with cancer treatment range from abnormal vasoreactivity to accelerated atherosclerosis, arterial thrombotic events, vasculitis, and arterial aneurysms or dissections. 5-fluorouracil and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inhibitors are the agents most commonly linked to abnormal vasoreactivity, whereas BCR-ABL (breakpoint cluster region–Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog) inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been associated with accelerated atherosclerosis. Arterial thrombotic events are seen with VEGF and BCR-ABL inhibitors as well as platinum drugs. Vasculitis emerged with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, and arterial aneurysms and dissections with VEGF inhibitors. Radiation therapy can lead to several of the outlined vascular toxicities. This review comprehensively explores the mechanisms of vascular complications associated with chemotherapy, targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and radiation therapy. Key contributors include endothelial injury and dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation. An understanding of the mechanisms of vascular toxicities may facilitate optimal treatment and preventive strategies in patients with cancer.
